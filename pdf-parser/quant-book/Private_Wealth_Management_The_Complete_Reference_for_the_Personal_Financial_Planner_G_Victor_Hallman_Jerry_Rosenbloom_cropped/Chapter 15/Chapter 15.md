## **Individual Retirement Accounts and Annuities (IRAs)**

*Competence Objectives for This Chapter* After reading this chapter, planners should understand:

- N The types of individual retirement accounts or annuities
- N IRA rollovers and direct transfers
- N Making the decision to establish different kinds of IRAs
- N The tax factors and economics in deciding whether to convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA
- N Rollover of Roth 401(k) account balance to a Roth IRA
- N Making gifts to family members so they can contribute to IRA's early
- N Deciding whether to use IRAs for qualified first-time home buyer distributions or higher education expenses

IRAs have become important and advantageous retirement and financial planning tools for many people. At the same time, however, as a result of numerous changes in the tax law, they have become quite complex. The following kinds of IRAs are now available to individuals:

- N Regular (earnings-related) traditional IRA
- N Rollover traditional IRA
- N Nondeductible traditional IRA
- N Roth IRA (earnings-related)
- N Roth IRA (conversion from traditional IRA)
- N Spousal IRA
- N Coverdell Education Savings Account (Education IRA)

- N SEP-IRA
- N SIMPLE-IRA

The SEP- and SIMPLE-IRAs were described in Chapter 14. The other kinds of IRAs are covered in this chapter.

## **Basic Concepts**

IRAs afford individuals an opportunity to set up their own tax-favored retirement plans, subject to certain conditions and limitations. An IRA can be an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. An *individual retirement account* can be set up under the terms of a written trust (in which case it may be called a "trusteed IRA") or as a custodial account with a fiduciary institution that meets the requirements of the IRS. The bulk of IRAs are in custodial accounts. An *individual retirement annuity* is a flexible premium annuity contract and may be a fixed-dollar annuity or a variable annuity.

For IRAs generally, the interest of the IRA owner must be nonforfeitable. Also, if an IRA is used as security for a loan or is assigned to another (other than a transfer incident to divorce), there will be a deemed distribution to the extent of the loan or transfer. Thus, IRAs generally cannot be borrowed against or given away to others.

## **Types of IRAs**

There is now an almost bewildering array of IRA plans with different rules or limits applying to each.

## **Regular (Earnings-Related) Traditional IRAs**

These plans may be called traditional IRAs, regular IRAs, or front-end IRAs. Only cash can be contributed to these plans.

**Nature and Limits of Contributions** Individuals may make income tax– deductible contributions (from gross income to arrive at adjusted gross income) to these IRAs based on their earnings, marital status, and whether they (and their spouse) are covered under certain employer-provided retirement plans. First, in situations where a person and his or her spouse (if any) are *not*  covered by an employer retirement plan (i.e., are not "active participants"), each income earner can make tax-deductible contributions each year, up to the smaller of 100 percent of compensation or \$5,000 for 2009 (with indexing for future inflation in \$500 increments). In addition, for IRA owners ages 50 and over, this annual limit is increased by \$1,000 for 2009 (indexed).

For this purpose, employer retirement plans include qualified retirement plans; federal, state, and local government plans; tax-sheltered annuity plans; SEPs; SIMPLE plans; and certain other plans. Also for this purpose, *compensation* means earned income as an employee, income from self-employment, or alimony.

In situations where a person is covered under an employer retirement plan, the income earner still may be able to make deductible contributions to a traditional IRA, subject to certain income limits. For married taxpayers filing a joint return (and for qualifying widows or widowers), for the year 2009, their modified adjusted gross income (MAGI1 ) for federal income tax purposes must not exceed \$89,000 for a full deduction. The deduction then is phased out for MAGI between \$89,000 and \$109,000. For single taxpayers and heads of households, the MAGI limit is \$55,000 for a full IRA deduction, and the deduction then is phased out between \$55,000 and \$65,000.

Finally, in situations where married persons are filing jointly and one of them is covered by an employer retirement plan but the other is not, the spouse covered by the plan can make deductible IRA contributions subject to the income limits just described. However, the noncovered spouse may make deductible IRA contributions subject to an MAGI phase-out range for their combined income of \$166,000 to \$176,000 in 2009 (all indexed).

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

First, let us assume Warren Williams, age 35, is a single taxpayer who works for a large corporation and is covered under the corporation's qualified pension plan. In the year 2009, Warren earns a salary of \$50,000 per year (which is also his MAGI). Warren can make a tax-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA, up to the full \$5,000 for the year, because, while he is covered by an employer retirement plan, his MAGI is less than \$55,000 for the year. However, if Warren's salary had been \$75,000, he could not have made any tax-deductible contribution to the IRA.2

1Modified adjusted gross income for traditional IRAs is adjusted gross income (AGI) plus any IRA deduction and certain other items. Thus, it is essentially the person's or couple's AGI. 2As will be explained in the later section on Roth IRAs, Warren could, however, have made a \$5,000 contribution to a non-tax-deductible but tax-free Roth IRA for the year because the phase-out range for single taxpayers for Roth IRAs is \$105,000 to \$120,000 in 2009. He could also have contributed to a nondeductible regular IRA.

On the other hand, if Warren's salary (and MAGI) for 2009 were \$60,000, he would be in the phase-out range for that year and could make a partial contribution to a tax-deductible IRA.3 Thus, Warren could deduct a \$2,500 contribution in 2009.4

Finally, if Warren's salary (and MAGI) for 2009 were \$125,000, he could not make any tax-deductible contribution to an IRA since he would be well beyond the phase-out range. He also could not make any contribution to a Roth IRA because he would be beyond its phase-out range as well.5

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

As another example, let us assume Peter and Mary Schmidt are married and file a joint income tax return. Peter, age 42, works for a corporation that covers him under its qualified 401(k) plan and receives a salary of \$100,000 in 2009. Mary works for a small employer with no retirement plan and receives a salary of \$60,000 in 2009. Assume their MAGI is \$160,000 for 2009. In this case, Peter could not make any deductible contribution to a traditional IRA since he is an active participant under an employer retirement plan and their MAGI exceeds the phase-out range for married persons for 2009. However, Mary could make a \$5,000 deductible contribution to a traditional IRA since she is not covered by an employer plan and their MAGI is below the phase-out range for a married person who is not covered by an employer plan but whose spouse is.6

3The formula for this calculation is:

Percentage of Reduction = MAGI – applicable dollar amount (the lower limit of the phase-out range) \$10,000 (or other difference in the phase-out range)

4He could also make a \$2,500 contribution to a Roth IRA since a Roth permits contributions

of the lesser of 100 percent of compensation or \$5,000, reduced by any contributions made for the year to a traditional IRA on the person's behalf, and the Roth phase-out limits would be \$105,000 to \$120,000.

5As will be noted later, in this situation, Warren still could have made a \$5,000 nondeductible contribution to a traditional IRA.

<sup>6</sup> It may also be noted that Peter as well as Mary (as an alternative to her deductible IRA) each could make \$5,000 cash contributions (\$10,000 total for the two) to Roth IRAs since coverage under employer retirement plans does not affect Roth eligibility and their MAGI is below the phase-out range for Roths (\$166,000 to \$176,000 for married persons filing jointly in 2009). Mary could also split her \$5,000 contribution between a deductible traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.

**Eligibility Requirements** Any individual who has compensation and has not attained age 70½ may be eligible to contribute to a deductible traditional IRA. Of course, if a person (or his or her spouse) is covered by an employer retirement plan, this may limit or eliminate his or her deductible IRA contribution, as just described. Also, employers in their qualified plans may allow employees to make voluntary contributions to a separate account or annuity that meets the requirements of a traditional or Roth IRA. These are referred to as *deemed IRAs* under employer plans.

**Tax Status** When making deductible contributions to a traditional IRA, the person or couple receives a current income tax deduction for the contribution, up to the previously described limits. Furthermore, investment earnings in the IRA grow without current taxation. But with respect to withdrawals, all amounts distributed are fully taxable as ordinary income.

In addition, distributions made prior to a traditional IRA owner's reaching age 59½ are considered premature distributions and are subject to an additional 10 percent penalty tax on the taxable amount, unless an exception applies. The exceptions include distributions due to the owner's death or disability; for deductible medical care; by unemployed persons to pay for health insurance premiums; to pay for qualified higher education expenses for the owner, the owner's spouse, or a child or grandchild of the owner or his or her spouse;7 as qualified first-time home buyer distributions (subject to a lifetime \$10,000 limit8 ); and as part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made at least annually for the life or the life expectancy of the IRA owner or the joint lives or life expectancies of the owner and his or her designated beneficiary of the IRA. It should be noted, however, that even if one of these exceptions applies, a distribution is still taxed as ordinary income.

When an IRA owner dies, any account balance in the IRA will be included in his or her gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. The account balance will be payable on death to the beneficiary or beneficiaries named in the IRA. The nature of this beneficiary designation will affect the estate tax status of the IRA, as explained in Chapter 26. This is true for all types of IRAs. However, for deductible traditional IRAs, the account balance is also

<sup>7</sup>Qualified higher education expenses include postsecondary school tuition, books, student supplies, and minimum room and board. These allowable expenses are reduced by nontaxable scholarships, fellowship grants, and educational assistance allowances.

<sup>8</sup>These are distributions received and used by the individual for qualified acquisition costs for a principal residence for a first-time home buyer, who may be the individual; his or her spouse; or any child, grandchild, or ancestor of the individual or his or her spouse. For this purpose, a first-time home buyer is an individual who did not have an ownership interest in a principal residence during the two-year period before the principal residence was acquired.

IRD to the beneficiary, as explained in Chapter 10. Planning for these issues is covered in Chapter 16.

**Required Distributions** The owner of a traditional IRA must begin taking taxable distributions no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the owner attains age 70½. This is called the *required beginning date* (RBD). After this date, certain minimum annual distributions must be taken. The calculation of and planning for these minimum distributions are covered in Chapter 16. People often have more than one traditional IRA, which may include earnings-related IRAs, discussed here, and rollover IRAs, covered next. The IRS requires that minimum distributions be calculated separately for each IRA, but then they may be totaled and can be taken from any one or more of the IRAs. There also are minimum distributions required for IRA account balances after an owner's death. Naturally, an IRA owner can take distributions before the RBD and larger distributions than the minimum.

## **Rollover Traditional IRAs**

These are traditional IRAs that receive *eligible rollover distributions* (defined in Chapter 16) from qualified retirement plans, TSAs, and Section 457 governmental deferred-compensation plans. These rollover distributions can be in the form of cash or property (such as employer stock from a qualified profit-sharing or savings plan). There also may be rollovers from an IRA to a qualified plan, a TSA, and a Section 457 plan.

**Eligibility Requirements** Any individuals, regardless of whether they currently have compensation (earnings), their income, or whether they are covered by an employer retirement plan, can establish a rollover IRA to receive an eligible rollover distribution.

**Tax Status** There is no current income taxation on the amount of an eligible rollover distribution to a rollover IRA. Thus, as an example, suppose that Mary Levy, age 40, has a \$400,000 account balance in her employer's qualified savings plan with a Section 401(k) option (i.e., the entire \$400,000 will eventually be taxable). She is leaving her current employer to join a new firm. She can elect to roll over all or part of the \$400,000 account balance (an eligible rollover distribution) into her own rollover IRA without any current income taxation on the transaction.9 Like other traditional IRAs, rollover IRAs are subject to taxation of distributions as ordinary income, the

<sup>9</sup> She also could elect to roll this amount over, tax-free, into her new employer's qualified retirement plan, if permitted by the new employer, or to a TSA or Section 457 plan.

10 percent penalty tax on premature distributions with the same rules and exceptions, inclusion in the gross estate for federal estate tax purposes, and being treated as IRD.

**Required Distributions** Like other traditional IRAs, rollover IRAs are subject to the minimum distribution rules just described.

## **Nondeductible Contributions to Traditional IRAs**

Since there are income limits on deductible IRA contributions when a person (or his or her spouse) is covered under an employer's retirement plan (as well as income limits on contributions to Roth IRAs, considered next), it is possible to make nondeductible contributions to traditional IRAs equal to the difference between what could have been contributed had there been no income limits and the amounts (if any) of deductible IRA contributions and Roth IRA contributions. When distributions are made, nondeductible (after-tax) contributions are the IRA owner's investment in the contract, which will be recovered income tax–free. However, for this purpose, all traditional IRAs owned by a person are treated as contract and any distributions in one year are treated as one distribution. Therefore, any nondeductible (nontaxable) portion of this hypothetical contract is considered to come pro rata from any distribution from any of the traditional IRAs owned even if the IRA from which the distribution is actually taken has most or all of the nondeductible contributions. This has been called the "cream in the coffee rule" (i.e., the contributions are all mixed up) and may result in reduced taxfree distributions from traditional IRAs with nondeductible contributions when the owner also has IRAs with no or few nondeductible contributions. These after-tax contributions can be rolled over to another IRA but not to an employer plan.

The only real tax advantage of making nondeductible IRA contributions is that investment income and capital gains accumulate in the IRA without current income taxation. However, when distributed, such income and capital gains are taxed as ordinary income.

## **Roth IRAs (Earnings-Related)**

A newer IRA concept is the non-tax-deductible but distribution tax–free Roth IRA.

**Nature and Limits of Contributions** Individuals may make contributions to Roth IRAs based on their earnings and marital status. It does not matter whether they are covered under an employer retirement plan. An individual income earner can make a contribution to a Roth IRA up to the smaller of 100 percent of compensation or the same dollar limits described previously for earnings-related traditional IRAs. There are also the same catch-up limits for owners age 50 or over. All these Roth dollar limits are indexed for inflation starting in 2010.

The income limits (phase-out ranges) for Roth IRAs are \$105,000 to \$120,000 of MAGI10 for single persons and heads of households and \$166,000 to \$176,000 of MAGI for married persons filing jointly in 2009 (indexed). The annual dollar limits also are reduced by any contributions to traditional IRAs for the same person during the year.

**Eligibility Requirements** Any individual who has compensation (earned income or taxable alimony) and whose MAGI does not exceed or is within the income limits is eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA. Roth contributions can be made after age 70½. Neither SEP- nor SIMPLE-IRA contributions can be made to a Roth IRA. However, once these contributions are in a traditional IRA, it can be converted to a Roth IRA under the rules for such conversions.

As explained in Chapter 13, Section 401(k) plans and Section 403(b) annuities can permit employees to elect to have all or part of their own elective deferrals designated as after-tax "Roth contributions" (DRACs). In this case, the employees must pay income tax currently on these Roth deferrals, but they will grow and be distributed tax-free. Any 401(k) or 403(b) plan participant can make DRAC contributions, regardless of income. These Roth 401(k) or 403(b) accounts can be rolled over tax-free to a Roth IRA under the rules for such rollover.

**Tax Status** Contributions to a Roth IRA are not deductible for income tax purposes, but investment earnings and capital gains in the IRA grow tax-free. Distributions from a Roth IRA (either earnings-related or a conversion from a traditional IRA) are not included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, provided they are qualified distributions. A *qualified distribution*  is one made at least five years after the tax year in which a person made the first contribution to any Roth IRA or in which a rollover (conversion) was made to the Roth IRA, *and* the distribution is taken on or after the person attains age 59½, on account of the person's death or disability, or is a qualified first-time home buyer distribution.11 Thus, a qualified Roth distribution must meet both a five-year test and a triggering events test. If a distribution does not meet these requirements, it is a nonqualified distribution and the

<sup>10</sup>This is MAGI for traditional IRA purposes minus any deductible IRA contributions and any income resulting from the conversion of a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA (considered next). 11Defined in the same way as in Footnote 8.

previously untaxed investment income will be taxable. Even in this situation, however, the non-tax-deductible contributions are assumed to come out first, so no tax is imposed until total nonqualifying distributions (from all Roth IRAs) exceed total contributions. (This really is the opposite of the "cream-in-the-coffee" rule.) If a distribution is taxable, the 10 percent penalty tax on premature distributions also may apply.

DRAC accounts also have similar qualifying (nontaxable) and nonqualifying (taxable) distributions. However, for DRACs there is no first-time home buyer triggering event and the five-year period begins when the participant makes the first contribution to that particular DRAC.

As a planning matter, it would seem unwise to take nonqualifying distributions that exceed total contributions. In fact, as an overall planning strategy, it seems prudent to keep assets in Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs for as long as possible to get the most advantage from tax-free growth of investment earnings for Roths and tax-deferred growth of earnings for traditional IRAs. This is the "stretch IRA" concept discussed in Chapter 16.

As in the case of traditional IRAs, when a Roth IRA owner dies, any account balance in the IRA is included in his or her gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. The account balance will be payable on death to the beneficiary or beneficiaries named in the IRA, and this will affect the estate tax status of the IRA. However, unlike traditional IRAs, the account balance is not taxable income as IRD to the beneficiary.

**Required Distributions** During the lifetime of a Roth IRA owner, there are no mandatory distributions. There is no required beginning date, and there are no required minimum distributions. This is a major advantage for the Roth IRA over traditional IRAs and qualified retirement plans, both of which are subject to mandatory distribution rules starting at age 70½. At the death of a Roth IRA owner, the minimum distribution rules applying to traditional IRA beneficiaries also apply to Roth IRA beneficiaries (see Chapter 16).

The situation is different for DRAC participants. Since DRACs are part of a qualified retirement plan, the required minimum distribution rules (which are required for plan qualification) must apply to DRAC participants. However, a DRAC participant can avoid them by rolling over his or her DRAC to a Roth IRA when eligible to do so.

## **Roth IRAs (Conversion from Traditional IRAs)**

**Nature and Limits of Conversions** A traditional IRA account balance may be converted into a Roth IRA by the owner, provided the owner's MAGI (as either a single person or a married person filing a joint return) does not exceed \$100,000 for the year of conversion.12 However, beginning in 2010 this \$100,000 limitation will be repealed and any traditional IRA owner, regardless of income, can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Any amount can be converted and conversions can be spread out to avoid bunching of ordinary income in only one or a few years.

A conversion can be affected by the traditional IRA owner's taking a distribution and then rolling over the amount to be converted into the Roth IRA within 60 days of the distribution or having a transfer of the amount converted from the trustee or custodian of the traditional IRA to the trustee or custodian of the Roth IRA without the owner actually receiving a distribution (a trustee-to-trustee transfer).13 Under either of these methods, the amount converted is taxable as ordinary income.

**Eligibility Requirements** The \$100,000 MAGI limit has already been noted. This limit will no longer apply after 2009. A SEP can be converted to a Roth. A SIMPLE-IRA can be converted after two years from the date the owner first participated in any SIMPLE-IRA plan of the employer. A qualified retirement plan now can be directly converted to a Roth IRA under PPA of 2006.

**Tax Status** The taxable portion of a traditional IRA that is converted to a Roth IRA is gross income for federal income tax purposes in the year of conversion. It normally is preferable to pay this tax from other, non-taxadvantaged assets so the full amount in the IRA can grow on a tax-free basis. While the taxable portion on conversion is subject to regular federal income taxation, it is not subject to the 10 percent tax on premature distributions.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Let us continue the example of Mary Levy. Ten years (in 2010) after she directly transferred the \$400,000 account balance from her qualified savings plan into her traditional rollover IRA, the account balance is now \$700,000. At this time (because the \$100,000 limit no longer applies), she decides to convert her traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Thus, the \$700,000 would be

<sup>12</sup>As stated in Footnote 11, MAGI, for this purpose, does not include income resulting from the conversion itself. Also, MAGI, for purposes of conversion eligibility, does not include minimum required distributions from traditional IRAs. This may be helpful for older persons, who may not have other income in excess of \$100,000 in a year, to make such conversions, perhaps for estate planning reasons.

<sup>13</sup> It may be noted that these are the same general methods as those used for rollovers and transfers from qualified retirement plans and TSAs to traditional IRAs. However, the tax withholding rules are different, as will be explained in Chapter 16.

added to her gross income in that year. If her tax rate on this amount of added income were, say, 35 percent, her added tax would be \$245,000 (\$700,000 × 0.35). Assuming this tax comes from other sources (so the full \$700,000 can grow tax-free in her Roth IRA), she effectively would lose the after-tax return on the \$245,000 tax payment for the future. This must be considered in analyzing a conversion. When Mary dies, any account balance will be in her gross estate, but it is not IRD.

**Required Distributions** The rules for required distributions from Roth IRAs have already been noted.

## **Spousal IRAs**

For married persons filing a joint return, when one of the spouses has no compensation (or compensation less than that of the other spouse) during a tax year, the working spouse may make contributions to an IRA for the nonworking spouse (a spousal IRA), as well as to the working spouse's own IRA. The maximum contribution to each of the IRAs for the year is the lesser of 100 percent of the working spouse's compensation (less certain items) or the dollar limits on contributions described previously. The spousal IRA can be a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. No more than the applicable limit can be contributed to each spouse's IRA, and each spouse must have his or her own separate IRA or subaccount in a plan.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that Sam and Martha Johnson, 52 and 48, respectively, are married and file a joint return and that Sam earns \$150,000 per year. He is an active participant under his employer's qualified savings plan. Martha works in their home and has no compensation for IRA purposes. In this case, Sam could make a \$6,000 contribution (\$5,000 regular and \$1,000 catch-up since he is over 50) in 2009 to his Roth IRA and another \$5,000 contribution to Martha's spousal Roth IRA for the year. This is because their MAGI is less than the Roth IRA phase-out range for married couples. As an alternative for Martha, Sam could contribute \$5,000 to a traditional deductible spousal IRA for her since their MAGI is less than the phase-out range when one spouse (Sam) is covered by an employer retirement plan but the other (Martha) is not. Sam cannot contribute to a deductible IRA for himself because he is covered by an employer plan and their MAGI exceeds the phase-out range for that situation.

## **Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (Education IRAs)14**

**Nature and Limits of Contributions** Individuals (whether they have earnings or not) can contribute up to \$2,000 per year per beneficiary to Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, subject to certain income limits. The income limits are a MAGI of \$95,000 to \$110,000 for single persons and \$190,000 to \$220,000 for married persons filing jointly. The phase-out operates in the same way as for Roth IRAs. The \$2,000-per-year limit is in addition to the limits for other IRAs discussed previously.

**Eligibility Requirements** In addition to eligible individuals, corporations and other entities also may make contributions to Education Savings Accounts, and in this case, the income limits just noted do not apply.

**Tax Status** Contributions to Education IRAs are not tax deductible and, correspondingly, withdrawals that meet the requirements of the tax law are not taxable. Investment earnings accumulate tax-free. To be eligible for tax-free withdrawals, the amounts withdrawn by the beneficiary must not exceed qualified education expenses.15 To the extent they do, a pro rata share of the untaxed investment earnings will be taxable to the beneficiary and a 10 percent penalty tax also will be applicable.

**Rollovers and Required Distributions** When the beneficiary of an Education IRA reaches age 30, he or she may roll over any unwithdrawn amounts (within 60 days of distribution) to an Education IRA for another member of the beneficiary's family. Such a rollover also can be done before age 30. If such actions have not been taken by age 30, any remaining funds must be distributed to the beneficiary, and the untaxed investment earnings will be taxable as ordinary income (including the 10 percent penalty tax).

Contributions to Education Savings Accounts are subject to gift tax, but are eligible for the \$13,000 (\$26,000 for married couples splitting gifts) in 2009, indexed for inflation, per donee per year gift tax annual exclusion.16 In a beneficiary-to-beneficiary rollover, as long as the beneficiaries are of the

<sup>14</sup>These are different in concept from the IRAs discussed previously in that they are designed for the funding of education expenses rather than for retirement. They originally were called "Education IRAs," but their official name now is "Coverdell Education Savings Accounts." In this book, we shall refer to them either as Education Savings Accounts or Education IRAs.

<sup>15</sup>These include qualified elementary and secondary education expenses (grades 1 through 12) and qualified higher education expenses, such as for tuition, books, supplies, equipment, room and board, and other items. They are reduced by nontaxable scholarships, fellowship grants, and educational assistance allowances.

<sup>16</sup>The gift tax annual exclusion is described in Chapter 27.

same generation (brothers and sisters, for example), there will be no taxable gift. However, when a new beneficiary is in the generation after that of the former beneficiary (a child of the former beneficiary, for example), there is a gift tax, but the annual exclusion applies.

Education IRAs serve the same general purpose as Section 529 plans– advance funding of education costs. (Section 529 plans are covered in Chapter 12.) However, they are less flexible than 529 plans, have lower contribution limits, have income phase-out limits, and require distribution when the beneficiary reaches age 30. Qualified education expenses for these IRAs are more extensive in that they include qualified elementary and secondary school expenses as well as qualified higher education expenses (which are the only expenses covered by 529 plans). Therefore, depending on the circumstances, a person might combine these two approaches and contribute annually \$2,000 to an Education IRA and \$11,000 to a 529 plan (in 2009) as a \$13,000 annual exclusion gift for a beneficiary. Then, the Education IRA could be used tax-free for elementary and secondary private schools (if desired) and, if necessary, for higher education expenses, while the 529 plan would be available tax-free for qualified higher education expenses.

## **IRA Rollovers and Direct Transfers**

Another kind of rollover to an IRA occurs when part or all of the assets received from one IRA are rolled over within 60 days to another IRA of the same type. There is no current income tax on such a rollover. This is called an *IRA-to-IRA rollover.* Part or all of the IRA assets are distributed to the owner, and then the owner rolls over those assets into another IRA. Such a rollover can be made only once a year, and the same property must be rolled over to the new IRA.

The other approach is a *direct IRA transfer.* Here, the assets of an IRA are transferred directly from one plan sponsor to another without passing into the hands of the IRA owner. In this case, there is no limit on the number of transfers that can be made in a year.

#### **Financial Institutions That Offer IRAs**

Many financial institutions offer IRAs to the public. Some of these institutions offer *self-directed IRAs.* These are IRAs in which the owner has virtually complete control over the selection of a broad range of investments. On the other hand, under these self-directed plans, the full burden of investment decision making falls on the IRA owner.

## **IRA Investments**

IRAs can be invested in a wide range of assets. These investments can be made through financial intermediaries or in individual assets through selfdirected IRAs. However, life insurance policies and certain collectibles are not eligible investments for IRAs.

## **Planning Issues for IRAs Deciding Whether to Establish an IRA**

The threshold issue is whether to contribute to an IRA at all. If a person is eligible to make deductible contributions to a traditional IRA or nondeductible contributions to a Roth IRA, there appear to be many advantages in doing so.

For deductible traditional IRAs, both the contributions and the investment earnings are before-tax, so the owner gets the power of deferral on both.

For Roth IRAs, the advantages of tax-free growth of investment earnings and longer time for tax-free growth make this plan just as attractive as, and possibly more so than, the traditional IRA. Which one is to be preferred in a given situation is a complicated issue that is considered in the next section.

With respect to nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA, however, the case is not so clear. The only real advantage is tax deferral on investment earnings.

## **Deciding between Traditional and Roth IRAs and Whether to Convert to a Roth IRA**

Of course, if a person is eligible for only one type, that settles the question. But many people will be eligible for both. Unfortunately, there is no sure answer to this question.

It can be divided into two subissues. The first issue is whether an eligible person should contribute to an earnings-related traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The second issue is whether an eligible person who has a traditional IRA should convert to a Roth IRA.

**Basic Equality between Deductible and Tax-Free Growth** In analyzing these issues, it may be helpful at the outset to note that if one takes a sum of money or a series of contributions, accumulates them tax-deferred, and then pays tax on the balance after a specified period (as in a traditional IRA), the result is the same as paying tax on the sum or series of contributions up front, deducting the tax, and accumulating the balance tax-free for the same period (as in a Roth IRA), provided the interest rates and tax rates assumed in both cases are the same. This may be somewhat counterintuitive, so let us take an example using a conversion situation.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume that Henry Petrofski, age 50, is in the 33 percent federal income tax bracket, owns a traditional IRA with a \$100,000 account balance, and plans to convert to a Roth IRA. Furthermore, assume he can earn a before-tax investment return of 8 percent and an after-tax return of 5.36 percent (8 percent × 0.67 = 5.36 percent). First, we shall assume Henry leaves the funds in his traditional IRA at an 8 percent average annual compound rate of return and withdraws all of them 20 years later at age 70.17 He then pays income tax on the entire \$466,096 accumulated balance at 33 percent.18 As a result, his after-tax return on the IRA at the end of the 20 years would be \$466,096 × 0.67 = \$312,284 (after tax). On the other hand, if we assume Henry converts his traditional IRA to a Roth, pays the income tax on the conversion from the IRA proceeds,19 allows the balance (\$67,000) to accumulate tax-free in the Roth at the 8 percent average annual compound rate of return, and then withdraws the entire balance tax-free in 20 years at age 70, Henry's after-tax return at the end of 20 years would be the same (\$100,000 × 0.67 = \$67,000 in the Roth IRA, which accumulates at 8 percent over 20 years to the same \$312, 284). But note that the fundamental assumptions in reaching this equality are that the investment earnings, tax rate, and the period of tax-deferred or tax-free growth must be the same for both scenarios at the beginning and end of the period.

However, as was stated in Footnote 19 and earlier, it is not good planning to take the tax on conversion from the IRA proceeds.20 Therefore, let us change the previous example to

17As a planning matter, he normally would withdraw them over time to preserve tax deferral for as long as possible. We make this assumption here only for purposes of illustration.

19As noted previously, it is not desirable to take the tax from the traditional IRA proceeds. It is better to use other non-tax-advantaged assets to pay the tax (or even to borrow to do so) so that the entire amount (\$100,000 in this illustration) can continue to grow tax-free. The opposite assumption is used here to make the analysis comparable.

20Correspondingly, one normally should contribute the full amount possible to an earningsrelated Roth IRA even though it is not deductible. The money to cover the foregone tax deduction must come from other non-tax-advantaged sources. The principle is the same.

<sup>18</sup>Again, as a practical matter, if he took this amount into income in one year, his tax bracket would increase to the maximum marginal rate. But we are making this tax rate assumption for purposes of comparison.

assume that Henry converts the entire \$100,000 traditional IRA to the Roth IRA and uses other non-tax-advantaged assets to pay the \$33,000 tax due. In this case, the Roth would grow tax-free at 8 percent to \$466,096 in 20 years. However, the \$33,000 of assets used to pay the tax on conversion also would have grown during this period, but at an after-tax average annual rate of 5.36 percent. This \$33,000 at 5.36 percent would have equaled \$93,762 in 20 years. Thus, if we subtract this amount from the Roth balance, we have \$466,096 – \$93,762 (accumulated aftertax value of tax) = \$372,334 value of the Roth.

This analysis shows an inherent advantage of the Roth IRA, either converted or earnings related. The foregone tax payment (or deduction) in effect grows tax-free inside the Roth IRA (at 8 percent here), while it would have grown at an after-tax rate (5.36 percent here) outside the Roth. This will always favor the Roth as long as the assumptions are held constant.

However, an even greater inherent advantage of the Roth is that the mandatory distribution rules do not apply to Roth IRAs during the owner's lifetime, but they do apply to traditional IRAs. Thus, in the previous example, Henry would have to start taking distributions from the traditional IRA—and paying tax on them—at age 70½. From that point on, the funds would be out of the IRA and, assuming they were reinvested, could earn only the assumed after-tax return of 5.36 percent.21 On the other hand, the funds in the Roth IRA could remain intact and continue to earn a tax-free return of 8 percent until Henry's death (at which time the minimum distribution rules relating to beneficiaries would apply).

**Factors in Choosing Which IRA** Given the inherent advantages of Roth IRAs just described, a number of other factors might be considered in this choice. First, let us consider the choice of making earnings-related contributions to a Roth IRA or to a traditional IRA.

*Relationship of Tax Rates at Time of Contribution and (Assumed) Rates at Distribution:* The same rates cause a wash, as just illustrated, except that the inherent advantages of Roth IRAs tilt the decision in their favor. Lower rates at time of contribution than assumed at time of distribution favor the Roth. The reverse favors the traditional. One may well wonder, however,

<sup>21</sup>The minimum distribution rules for qualified plans and IRAs are described in Chapter 16.

how anyone can predict with any degree of confidence what tax rates will be 10, 20, 30, 40, or even more years from now. The authors certainly cannot. It is even difficult to say that income tax rates during retirement many years in the future will be lower than rates during active employment.

*Length of Time until Distribution from IRA:* As far as the basic equality described previously is concerned, it does not make any difference. However, the longer this period, the greater is the inherent deferral advantage of Roth IRAs.

*Rate of Investment Return on IRA Assets:* Again, as far as the basic equality is concerned, this factor is neutral as long as the same investment returns and tax rates are assumed for both types of IRAs. However, higher rates increase the inherent tax-free advantages of Roth IRAs.

*Need for IRA Assets for Retirement Income (or Before Death):* This shortens the deferral period and so lessens the inherent advantages of Roths.

*Qualifying for and Financing the IRA:* The eligibility and contribution rules differ for these two types of IRAs. Also, it is easier from a cash flow point of view to make a full contribution each year to a traditional IRA than to a Roth IRA because of the current income tax deduction for contributions to a traditional IRA.

With respect to converting from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, the decision factors just noted are essentially the same, except their relative importance may vary. There also are some other factors affecting whether to convert.

*Financing a Conversion:* This involves paying the income tax on the traditional IRA. The entire tax is due for the amount converted in the year of conversion. This may pose a cash drain problem for taxpayers.

*Owner's Tax Rate Due to Conversion:* The additional income from the conversion may push the owner-taxpayer into a higher income tax bracket. This may raise tax rates at the time of conversion relative to the time of distribution which may favor keeping the traditional IRA. However, the amounts converted can be spread out over several years to mitigate this factor. Also, in some cases IRA owners may be able to do time conversions for years in which they have relatively low taxable incomes and tax rates.

**Making Gifts So Family Members Can Contribute to IRAs** Parents or others may wish to make gifts to their children or other family members who have earned income to enable them to contribute to their own IRAs. This probably would be to Roth IRAs, since a tax deduction would be relatively insignificant for lower-income taxpayers. These gifts normally would fall within the \$13,000 (indexed) per year, per donee gift tax annual exclusion (in 2009), and hence no taxable gift would result.

## **Investing IRA Funds**

Another planning issue is how to invest IRA money. First, IRA investments should fit into the overall asset allocation strategy. Second, from a tax point of view, the factors presented in Chapter 9 concerning the ways investments should be held are applicable to this planning issue, at least with respect to traditional IRAs.

The main difference may lie with respect to Roth IRAs. Since distributions from Roth IRAs are tax-free, all investment returns inside a Roth come out income tax–free during the owner's lifetime or to his or her beneficiary after the owner's death. The effect of this is much like the step-up in basis rule for directly owned capital assets at the owner's death. Hence, assets that may produce long-term capital gains on this basis would be more attractive in a Roth than in a traditional IRA. However, from a tax perspective, it still may be preferable to hold long-term capital gain assets directly.

## **Use of IRAs for Qualified First-Time Home Buyer Distributions or Qualified Higher Education Expenses**

As noted earlier, distributions for these purposes from a traditional IRA will not be subject to the 10 percent tax on premature distributions. However, they will be subject to regular tax as ordinary income. Also, a first-time home buyer distribution is a qualified tax-free distribution from a Roth IRA. However, such distributions take otherwise tax-deferred or tax-free funds from the IRA and result in current taxation for traditional IRAs. Hence, it seems better to finance these needs from other sources, if possible.

## **Naming the IRA Beneficiary or Beneficiaries**

There is a more extensive discussion of this issue for IRAs and qualified retirement plans in the next chapter.

## **Planning Distributions from IRAs**

Planning for distributions from IRAs and qualified retirement plans also is discussed in Chapter 16.
