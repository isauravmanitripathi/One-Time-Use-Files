# **Long-Term Care Insurance and Medicaid Planning**

*Competence Objectives for This Chapter* After reading this chapter, planners should understand:

- N The nature of the custodial care exposure
- N The elements of long-term care (LTC) insurance
- N Long-term care benefits under life insurance policies
- N The tax treatment of LTC benefits
- N Lack of coverage under Medicare and private health insurance for longterm care exposure
- N The nature and eligibility requirements for Medicaid
- N Medicaid as a source of custodial care coverage
- N Asset transfers and Medicaid eligibility
- N Other Medicaid planning techniques

The nature of the long-term care or custodial care exposure was outlined in Chapter 1. It has attracted increasing attention and concern over the years.

# **Nature of Exposure**

Long-term care can be financially devastating. If, for example, a loved one requires skilled nursing facility care, an average cost might be around \$200 (or more) per day, or \$73,000 per year, for nursing home care alone. This amount normally will be deductible for federal income tax purposes, by the person paying the cost, as an itemized medical expense.1 However, even with a tax deduction, this level of expense can be a financial disaster for most families. Of course, different levels of care may cost less, but it still will be significant.

The persons who may be at financial risk for such care, of course, include the person who needs the care and his or her spouse. However, they also may include children, grandchildren, other family members, and their spouses who may be faced with parents, grandparents, or other loved ones who need custodial or long-term care.

Several possible levels of long-term care services may be utilized, depending on the situation and the desires of the parties. These include the following and are listed from the highest level of care to the lowest:

- N *Skilled nursing care facilitie.* These facilities have the staff and equipment necessary to provide skilled nursing or rehabilitative services on a daily basis.
- N *Intermediate-care facilitie.* These provide primarily custodial care, but also have skilled nursing and rehabilitative services available if needed.
- N *Custodial care facilitie.* Such facilities are residential facilities designed to provide primarily custodial care and are not equipped to provide skilled nursing services.
- N *Adult day care.* These facilities provide care on a nonresidential basis.
- N *Home health care.* Facilities like these may cover services provided by a qualified home health-care agency or others.

# **Basic Planning Approaches**

The following planning approaches are being used to meet this exposure:

- N Purchase of long-term care (LTC) insurance. This involves advance planning and funding for this expense.
- N Planning to become eligible for government benefits, essentially Medicaid.
- N Other estate planning decisions made with long-term care needs in mind.

1Medical and dental expenses paid by a taxpayer for the taxpayer, his or her spouse, or his or her dependents are considered an itemized deduction (i.e., from adjusted gross income to arrive at taxable income, if the taxpayer itemizes his or her deductions) to the extent that the expenses exceed 7.5 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the year.

Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, unreimbursed expenses for qualified long-term care services are considered to be for medical care and are deductible under the medical expense provision of the IRC. Qualified long-term care services generally are services or care given to provide assistance to a chronically ill or disabled individual. They are explained further in this chapter.

# **Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance and Other Arrangements**

LTC insurance is the main source of advance insurance funding for the longterm care exposure.

# **Sources of LTC Insurance**

- N Individual LTC insurance purchased by consumers
- N LTC insurance purchased by individuals through association group plans
- N LTC riders added to life insurance and annuity contracts
- N Group LTC insurance purchased by employees through their employers
- N Coverage available through continuing care retirement community (CCRC) plans

# **General Nature of Coverage**

LTC insurance customarily provides a specified reimbursement or an indemnity benefit per day (a per diem benefit) for covered care after an initial waiting period of a stated number of days, up to certain maximum benefits. Under present contracts, there usually are multiple definitions of when coverage begins, but benefits generally are payable when the insured person becomes unable to perform a certain number (usually two or three) of *activities of daily living* (ADLs) that are stated in the policy. Examples of ADLs are eating, bathing, dressing, taking medication, toileting, and transferring and walking.

Insured persons normally can select from a range of elimination (waiting) periods, maximum daily benefits, and maximum lifetime benefits. LTC policies often provide optional inflation protection, guaranteed insurability, and other optional benefits. They usually have waiver-of-premium provisions. When LTC benefits are offered on a group basis as an employee benefit, coverage normally is voluntary and employees generally must pay the full cost. When LTC coverage is purchased as a rider to a life insurance contract, the benefits may or may not be a function of the face amount of life insurance.

# **Covered Services (Levels of Care)**

The kinds of services that may be covered under LTC policies include skilled nursing facility care, intermediate nursing facility care, custodial nursing facility care, other custodial facility care, home health care, home care, adult day care, respite care, and hospice care. Many commentators have suggested that consumers are better protected by purchasing coverage with a relatively broad range of services that includes not only nursing home care, but also custodial facility care, home health care, home care, and probably adult day care. This is because many people will want to receive custodial care other than in an institutional format when possible.

#### **Benefit Amounts Provided**

LTC policies provide a specified dollar amount per day for the covered levels of care. The insured often has a choice among a range of daily benefit amounts (such as from \$50 to \$300 or more per day), with the premium naturally increasing as the daily benefit increases.

The daily benefit may vary with the level of care used. On the other hand, many LTC policies today provide the same daily benefit for all covered levels of care. This is preferable for the consumer.

In choosing the benefit amount, the consumer must balance adequate protection against premium cost. Of course, other resources (such as an investment fund) may affect this decision. However, many people prefer not to deplete their other resources unduly, especially since they do not know how long they might need custodial care in the future. They often want to preserve their estates for their spouses, children, or other heirs.

There are two ways the daily benefit amount can be structured. The first is to pay actual charges incurred up to the policy's daily benefit amount. This is referred to as an *expense reimbursement policy.* The other is to pay the policy's daily benefit, regardless of the actual charges incurred. This is called a *per diem policy.* The tax treatment of an LTC policy depends on which form is involved.

#### **Maximum Benefits**

LTC plans normally have maximum lifetime benefit limits. This is the maximum aggregate time period (number of days or months) or dollar amount of benefits the insurer will pay during the lifetime of an insured. In addition, some plans impose a maximum limit for each period of confinement, each period of care, or each illness. This is less desirable for the insured. A few policies have an unlimited benefit period.

The insured often is given a choice among several maximum limits. In general, it seems better to select the longest (or largest) maximum benefit available, even though the cost will be greater. The insured has no way of knowing how long he or she may need long-term care in the future.

#### **Elimination Period (Waiting Period)**

The waiting period is the number of days of continuous confinement or care that must be incurred before LTC benefits will commence. Most LTC insurance has such a waiting period, ranging from 15 to 100 days or more. LTC policies often give the purchaser a choice of several waiting periods, with premium reductions for longer waiting periods. One way to reduce cost is to purchase coverage with a longer waiting period. On the other hand, the consumer needs to consider whether the premium savings are worth the potential loss of benefits.

# **Coverage (or Benefit) Triggers**

Modern LTC policies commonly have several definitions of when a covered person can qualify for benefits. These are called *definitions of disability* or *coverage triggers.* The following are possible alternative coverage triggers:

- N The covered person is unable to perform a specified number (usually two or three) of a list of activities of daily living (ADLs).
- N The covered person has a *cognitive impairment,* which generally means the deterioration in or loss of the person's intellectual capacity, and can be measured by clinical evidence and standardized tests. Examples would be organic brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.2
- N A physician certifies that the covered person needs long-term care services as a medical necessity*.* This alternative definition may be liberal for the insured since his or her own physician may be able to certify the need for benefits.

Most policies allow coverage if one of the first two alternative benefit triggers exists, but some use all three. All three would be more liberal for the insured.

# **Continuance (or Renewal) Provisions**

The consumer should seek to buy individual LTC coverage that is at least guaranteed renewable, as was explained in Chapter 22. LTC insurance normally is not available on a noncancelable basis. When LTC insurance is purchased as association group coverage, check to see what rights, if any, the insured person has to continue the coverage directly with the insurance company in the event the group policy is terminated.

<sup>2</sup>The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in its Model Act on LTC insurance requires that LTC policies cover Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other organic brain disorders that occur after the LTC policy has been issued. Individual state insurance laws (which are controlling) may or may not follow this Model Act.

#### **Issue Ages**

Insurance companies often limit the persons to whom they will sell LTC coverage to those within certain age ranges, commonly ages 50 to 80. Once issued, LTC policies usually can be continued for life.

#### **Extent of Individual Underwriting**

Individual and association group plans almost always require some measure of individual underwriting for each applicant. Larger group plans may allow coverage on a guaranteed issue basis without individual selection.

## **Premiums and Nonforfeiture Values**

The premiums for LTC insurance normally depend on such factors as the insured's age, gender, maximum benefit period, waiting period, daily benefit amount, any inflation protection or other optional benefits, and perhaps the state where the policy is issued. Premium rates normally are level, based on the insured's age when the policy was originally issued. That is, the premium (as of the original issue age) remains level as the insured gets older, except for possible rate increases applied to whole classes of insureds under guaranteed renewable policies. Obtaining lower, level premiums for the rest of the insured's life is one advantage of buying LTC coverage early. In addition, the person may become uninsurable for LTC coverage as he or she gets older.

LTC policies may contain nonforfeiture benefits, which provide continuing benefits for the policyowner if he or she should stop paying premiums after the policy has been in force for a reasonable period. The nonforfeiture benefit may take the form of a paid-up policy for a reduced daily benefit or extended term coverage for the same daily benefit for a given period. LTC policies normally do not provide cash values.

## **Benefits under Life Insurance and Annuity Policies**

These LTC riders provide essentially the same kinds of benefits as the LTC policies just discussed. They are combination contracts and provide the tax advantages discussed in Chapters 17 and 21 for such contracts starting in 2010.

#### **Tax Treatment of LTC and Accelerated Death Benefits**

Accelerated death benefits paid under life insurance contracts are excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes if the insured is *terminally ill*. For this purpose, a terminally ill person has an illness or physical condition that has been certified to be reasonably expected to result in death within 24 months. Also excluded from gross income are life insurance accelerated death benefits on insureds who are *chronically ill,* as defined in the next paragraph.

With respect to the federal income tax status of LTC insurance contracts, the tax law treats qualified long-term care insurance contracts as accident and health insurance for tax purposes. *Qualified long-term care insurance contracts*  are insurance contracts (either LTC riders on life insurance or annuity policies or other LTC policies) that provide coverage only for "qualified longterm care services" and meet certain other requirements.3 *Qualified long-term care services* include necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, rehabilitative, maintenance, and personal care services for a "chronically ill individual" that are provided pursuant to a plan of care prescribed by a licensed health-care practitioner. A *chronically ill individual* is a person who is unable to perform at least two activities of daily living4 due to loss of functional capacity or a similar level of disability, or who requires substantial supervision because of severe cognitive impairment. In essence, then, a qualified long-term care insurance contract for tax purposes provides benefits for personal care and services to maintain and care for a chronically ill individual, defined in terms of the inability to perform at least two activities of daily living or a severe cognitive impairment.5

The tax benefits from a qualified LTC insurance contract are as follows:

N Benefits received are excluded (or partially excluded) from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Periodic payments (e.g., daily benefits) that do not exceed the actual costs incurred are entirely tax free. When benefits do exceed the actual costs incurred (as they might, for example, under a per diem–type LTC contract), they are excluded from gross income only up to a maximum of \$280 per day in 2009.6

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that Mary Donnelly is insured under a per diem– type qualified LTC contract providing a daily benefit of \$300. Furthermore, assume that she becomes unable to perform two

6This excluded amount is indexed for inflation based on changes in the medical care component of the consumer price index in \$10 multiples.

<sup>3</sup>For example, the contract must be guaranteed renewable, not have a cash surrender value, not duplicate Medicare benefits, and satisfy various consumer protection provisions of the long-term care insurance Model Act and regulations promulgated by the NAIC.

<sup>4</sup>The activities of daily living included are eating, toileting, transferring, bathing, dressing, and continence. At least five of these activities must be used in the contract before it will be treated as a qualified long-term care insurance contract.

<sup>5</sup>Note that for tax purposes, a terminally ill individual is not considered chronically ill.

#### **552 Part VII. Insurance Planning and Risk Management**

out of six ADLs (a benefit trigger under her policy) and is confined in a covered nursing home where she incurs actual costs for qualified long-term care services of \$200 per day. In this case, \$280 (in 2009) of the \$300 per diem benefit she receives will be excluded from Mary's gross income for federal tax purposes and the other \$20 per day will be gross income to her. Thus, benefits from per diem–type qualified LTC contracts will be income tax–free to the extent just described. On the other hand, benefits received from expense reimbursement–type qualified LTC contracts will be entirely tax-free since they are payable only to the extent of actual costs incurred.

- N Premiums paid by employers for employer-provided qualified LTC insurance generally are excluded from a covered employee's gross income.
- N Finally, as cited in Footnote 1 of this chapter, unreimbursed amounts paid for qualified long-term care services provided to a taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse or dependents may be deductible as medical care for individuals. In addition, premiums paid for qualified LTC insurance, up to specified limits based on the insured's attained age,7 similarly may be deductible as medical expenses. It must be remembered, however, that medical expenses (including LTC expenses and premiums) are deductible only if the taxpayer itemizes his or her deductions and only to the extent that total medical expenses in a year exceed 7.5 percent of the taxpayer's AGI.

# **Medicaid Planning for Long-Term (Custodial) Care**

Assuming a person has not made adequate advance preparation for the long-term care exposure through LTC insurance, another strategy is to seek coverage for this exposure through government programs—mainly the Medicaid program. Various techniques and possible pitfalls are involved in this approach, which will be explored in this section. Planning in this area has been significantly affected by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA). This law generally made it more difficult for persons to qualify for Medicaid to meet the custodial care exposure.

<sup>7</sup>This annual dollar limit ranges from \$320 for persons not more than 40 years old to \$3,980 for persons over age 70 as of 2009.

#### **Medicare and Private Health Insurance and the Long-Term Care Exposure**

Medicare and private health insurance (other than LTC insurance) really cannot be counted on to meet the long-term care exposure. The Medicare benefits most likely to respond to the long-term care exposure—coverage of skilled nursing home care and home health care—are limited. For example, Medicare nursing home coverage applies only to skilled nursing care or skilled rehabilitative care, after medically necessary hospitalization for at least three consecutive days, to admission to the skilled nursing facility within 30 days after the hospital discharge, and only after a physician certifies the need for skilled care. Many custodial care facilities and levels of care would be precluded by these requirements. Furthermore, Medicare covers only a maximum of 100 days of skilled nursing facility care, with a copayment for the 21st through the 100th days. Medicare home health-care coverage applies only to part-time or intermittent care, to housebound patients, under a physician's care who certifies the need for care.

In general, Medicare is designed to provide coverage for acute medical conditions rather than custodial care. However, limited coverage still may be available from Medicare, and it certainly should be investigated when faced with an actual need.

Private health insurance, aside from LTC insurance, normally specifically excludes expenses incurred for custodial care. This includes Medigap policies, which only fill the gaps in Medicare, rather than broadening that coverage to include LTC benefits. However, as in the case of Medicare, all forms of available private health insurance should be used to the extent feasible.

## **Medicaid**

Medicaid is a federal-state public assistance (welfare) program aimed at providing broad medical expense benefits to certain categories of the needy. The overall standards for the program are established by the federal government, but the specific eligibility requirements and benefits provided vary among the states. Therefore, the specific requirements of a person's own state must be consulted in Medicaid planning.

**Eligibility Requirements in General** To be eligible for Medicaid, persons must be in an eligible category and must meet certain financial requirements of need. These financial requirements include resource (asset) limits and income limits. Some states place limits on both the assets a person may have and the income he or she may receive. Other states only limit assets for eligibility. However, even in states with no eligibility cap on income, a Medicaid recipient will be required to pay (spend down) virtually all of his or her privately available income for any nursing home care received before Medicaid will pay for the remaining cost. Federal regulations define such income broadly as ". . . anything you receive in cash or in kind that you can use to meet your needs for food, clothing, or shelter." The resource limit varies by state, but generally is from \$2,000 to \$3,000 in nonexempt assets.

**Benefits Provided** The services covered by Medicaid are broad and, with a few exceptions, do not require any copayments, deductibles, or coinsurance by eligible recipients. They embrace not only comprehensive coverage for acute care, but also substantial coverage for long-term care, such as unlimited nursing home care and home health-care services.

#### **What Assets and Income Are Considered in Determining Medicaid Eligibility?**

**Both Spouses Considered** The nonexempt assets of both spouses are considered in determining the eligibility of one or both spouses for Medicaid. One spouse, for example, may be entering a nursing home for custodial care, while the other still may be living independently in the outside community. The spouse in the nursing home may be referred to as the *institutionalized spouse* (who may be seeking eligibility for Medicaid), while the other may be referred to as the *community spouse* (or *healthy spouse*), who is still living independently in the general community. In such a case, the nonexempt assets of both spouses will be counted in determining whether the resource limitation has been exceeded at the time of application for Medicaid by the institutionalized spouse. This is referred to as the "spousal unity rule."

There are, however, several exceptions to this general statement that may offer planning opportunities. First, this counting of the community spouse's assets is made only once at the time of application for Medicaid by the institutionalized spouse. It is like a snapshot picture of the community spouse's assets at that time. Therefore, nonexempt assets the community spouse may acquire after that date do not count toward the resource limit of the institutionalized spouse.

Second, the community spouse is allowed to keep (without it being considered a resource) the greater of a minimum amount or one-half the couple's total nonexempt assets, up to a maximum dollar amount. Furthermore, states can increase this minimum up to the maximum amount.8 Thus, the

<sup>8</sup>The minimum and maximum that the community spouse can keep in his or her name without disqualifying the other spouse for Medicaid are indexed for inflation. The healthy spouse also may be able to keep additional assets, depending on the couple's income and expenses.

community spouse does not have to be impoverished in order for the institutionalized spouse to be eligible for Medicaid.

Third, the community spouse can keep all of his or her own income without affecting the other spouse's eligibility. Thus, it may be desirable to shift income to the community spouse, such as through the purchase of an annuity (subject to certain conditions).

Finally, the community spouse may be able to keep a portion of the Medicaid recipient's income, depending on the community spouse's expenses and the federal poverty rate of income for a two-person household.

**Trust Assets or Income as a Resource of a Trust Beneficiary** With regard to *living (inter vivos) trusts*<sup>9</sup> created by anyone other than the Medicaid applicant or the applicant's spouse, and with regard to *testamentary trusts*<sup>10</sup> created by anyone, any trust assets or income that are required to be paid to a beneficiary or any trust assets or income that a beneficiary has the power to withdraw will be counted as a resource or as income for purposes of the beneficiary's eligibility for Medicaid. Hence, a planning technique may be to use *discretionary trusts* created by someone other than a potential Medicaid applicant or his or her spouse or *discretionary testamentary trusts*.

With regard to living trusts created by a Medicaid applicant or the applicant's spouse (as grantor) for the benefit of either of them, any trust assets or income that the trustee may pay out to the Medicaid applicant or the applicant's spouse, assuming full use of the trustee's discretion in favor of the Medicaid applicant or his or her spouse, will be counted as a resource or as income for purposes of determining the grantor-beneficiary's eligibility for Medicaid. Under this rule, the applicable trust assets or income are deemed available to the applicant or his or her spouse, whether they are actually paid to him or her by the trustee or not. These are referred to as *Medicaid qualifying trusts* (MQTs), and such trusts cannot be used to facilitate eligibility for Medicaid. However, discretianory testamentary trusts created by anyone and supplementary needs trusts created by others are not MQTs and will not cause their assets or income to be counted as resources or income for a beneficiary's Medicaid eligibility.

**Qualified Retirement Plans and IRAs as Available Resources** Qualified retirement plans, such as Section 401(k) plans, often are not counted as available resources for Medicaid eligibility and often are not required to be

<sup>9</sup>These are trusts created while the grantor or creator of the trust is alive. They are normally created by a deed of trust.

<sup>10</sup>These are trusts created after the grantor's or creator's death under the terms of the grantor's or creator's will.

liquidated by a Medicaid applicant, even when he or she is able to do so. On the other hand, IRAs and retirement plans for the self-employed (HR-10 plans) may be considered available resources and, hence, must be liquidated and spent down before their owners can seek Medicaid nursing home coverage. Therefore, as a planning matter, it may not be desirable for someone who is likely to become a Medicaid applicant to roll over his or her qualified retirement plan balance into an IRA if it can be kept in a former employer's qualified retirement plan.

**Exempt Assets** Various assets belonging to a Medicaid applicant (or his or her spouse) will not be counted in determining Medicaid eligibility. For example, an exempt asset may be an applicant's principal residence (with home equity limited to \$500,000 or \$750,000), subject to certain conditions and the possibility that the government may place a lien on the home to recover nursing home costs, which generally is exercisable at death or on the sale of the home. There are other exempt assets as well. Owning exempt assets and possibly converting nonexempt assets into exempt assets can present Medicaid planning possibilities.

**Transferred Assets** Certain gratuitous transfers of assets (gifts) by the applicant or the applicant's spouse will cause the value of those assets to be considered resources of the applicant and may result in the applicant's being ineligible for Medicaid for a period. Thus, transfers of assets to family members or others (other than the applicant's spouse, since their assets are considered together anyway) to get below the resource limit for Medicaid eligibility must be done within certain rules for proper planning. These rules are discussed separately in the next section.

# **Asset Transfers and Medicaid Eligibility**

Persons (or their families) who are faced with the need for long-term nursing home care may want to transfer as much of their assets as possible to family members and then qualify for Medicaid. The alternative (assuming there is no LTC insurance) would be for the person to exhaust (spend down) almost all of his or her nonexempt assets in paying for the care before he or she could reach the resource limit to qualify for Medicaid. In this case, there probably would be little left after the person's death. However, the government has placed rules and possibly roadblocks in the way of such planning.

**The Lookback Rule and Planning Techniques** Transfers of assets for less than fair market value (gifts) by a potential Medicaid applicant or his or her spouse within the so-called lookback period will be attributed back to the applicant as available resources and may cause the applicant to be temporarily ineligible. The lookback period under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 is now 60 months prior to the date of application for Medicaid. The period of ineligibility for Medicaid that results from transfers of nonexempt assets within the lookback period (other than exempt transfers, described next) is the period in months measured by the value of the gratuitous transfer divided by the particular state's average monthly cost for private-pay nursing home care. Under the DRA of 2005, any such period of ineligibility begins to run from the date on which the Medicaid applicant would have been eligible except for the transfer penalty (i.e., when the applicant's resources are depleted below the resource limit).

Medicaid planning involving asset transfers may be used when there are enough assets (or insurance) so that application for Medicaid can be delayed until after the 60-month lookback period has ended.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that John Wilson, who is age 72 and divorced, owns \$500,000 of nonexempt assets in his own name and needs to enter a nursing home for custodial care. He does not have LTC insurance. The nursing home cost is \$150 per day, or about \$4,500 per month. At the urging of his children, John transfers about \$230,000 of his nonexempt assets to his children or others and retains around \$270,000 to pay (spend down) for nursing home care for the 60-month lookback period (\$4,500 per month × 60 months = \$270,000). After the end of the lookback period, John applies for Medicaid. The transfer to his children would not be counted as a resource because it was made before the lookback period began (60 months before applying for Medicaid). He would have virtually no nonexempt assets because he had already spent them down for nursing home care and other expenses over the past 60 months. Thus, he would at that point be eligible for Medicaid, which would pay for nursing home care from then on.11

**Exempt Transfers** Certain transfers are excluded from the previously described rules. These exempt transfers sometimes can present planning opportunities.

<sup>11</sup> If John had income during this period, he might have to spend down the income before Medicaid would pay or, depending on state law, he might be ineligible for Medicaid. Also, if John had a noninstitutionalized (community) spouse at the time he applied for Medicaid, her nonexempt assets (over the allowance discussed previously) would also be considered as available resources in determining John's eligibility.

#### **Cautions in Transferring Assets to Attain Medicaid Eligibility**

There are disadvantages as well as advantages in transferring assets to attain Medicaid eligibility. To qualify for Medicaid, an applicant must virtually impoverish himself or herself (with the exception of exempt assets and other techniques discussed here). This has several implications. It may cause intergenerational conflicts. The aged parent who seeks nursing home care may resist giving away virtually all of his or her life's savings, while the children may want to preserve at least some of those assets for themselves or future generations. Furthermore, if the institutionalized person's condition should improve sufficiently to return to the community, what then? Some have suggested that there may be less favorable treatment in nursing homes for Medicaid patients than for private-paying patients. Such discrimination against Medicaid patients is illegal, but the perception still may be that it exists. Finally, the coverage for persons on Medicaid, while broad, does have some limits.

Furthermore, to the extent that lifetime giving is employed to attain Medicaid eligibility, the general cautions about making lifetime gifts (discussed more fully in Chapter 27) apply here. In particular, if an aged person gives away assets with a low income tax basis (say, to children) and then dies, the assets do not get a stepped-up income tax basis in the hands of the doneechildren as they would if the children had inherited them from their parent at death. On the other hand, the general advantages of lifetime giving apply. Much depends on the facts of the particular situation.

Finally, it is clear that government policy does not favor transfers of resources to qualify for Medicaid. This is clear from the DRA of 2005.

Thus, for persons or families who are in a position to make advance preparation for the custodial care exposure, such as through the purchase of adequate LTC insurance, these cautioning factors should be carefully considered. It normally is better to insure against the LTC exposure. Of course, if a person is already advanced in years or is uninsurable and is in need of nursing home care, Medicaid planning may be the only viable alternative.

#### **Overview of Medicaid Planning Techniques**

We have seen that a number of techniques can aid a person in becoming eligible for Medicaid and conserving assets for the family. One possibility is to convert nonexempt assets into exempt assets to the extent feasible. For example, cash and marketable assets (e.g., securities) could be used to pay off a mortgage on a residence or even to purchase a residence. Other exempt assets could also be purchased. Also, nonexempt assets could be transferred to a community spouse (an exempt transfer) so that the community spouse can have the maximum amount of assets allowed by law without having those assets considered in determining the institutionalized spouse's eligibility.

Another technique might be for a residence (or other exempt assets) to be transferred to a community spouse before application for Medicaid by the other spouse. Once the institutionalized spouse has qualified for Medicaid, the community spouse will be free to sell the residence or other exempt assets without disqualifying the institutionalized spouse.

Furthermore, income can be provided for a community spouse because that spouse's income is not counted in determining Medicaid eligibility of the institutionalized spouse. One way to do this is for the community spouse to purchase an annuity contract, with the income payments not to extend beyond the life expectancy of the community spouse. Such an annuity may not be considered a resource for Medicaid eligibility purposes, but rather as a source of income for the community spouse. A potential Medicaid applicant may also use exempt transfers of his or her nonexempt assets to the extent possible to shift these assets to other eligible family members.

As explained earlier, a common planning technique is to transfer part of a potential Medicaid applicant's nonexempt assets to family members (other than the applicant's spouse) before the 60-month lookback period begins.

Finally, in their estate planning, others may consider the Medicaid eligibility status of family members. For example, suppose a potential community spouse has assets that he or she would like to leave at death for the benefit of a spouse who may be institutionalized. Instead of leaving the assets outright to the spouse (which might later disqualify that spouse for Medicaid), the propertied spouse might leave the assets under a testamentary trust, with the other spouse being a discretionary beneficiary only. Other family members also may use trusts that give broad discretionary powers to the trustee for the benefit of persons who may need to qualify for government assistance benefits.
