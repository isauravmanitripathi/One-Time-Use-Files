# **The Federal Income Tax on Individuals Basic Tax Structure**

The federal income tax law is detailed and complex. However, the basic formula for determining an individual's tax can be shown briefly as follows.1

*Gross income:* This means all income from whatever sources derived, unless specifically excluded by a provision of the tax code. This approach can be described as gross income being an "all-inclusive concept." It is defined in this way in the IRC Section 61. The courts have further defined gross income as the accretion to a taxpayer's wealth over a given period, with some exceptions.

<sup>1</sup>The basic income tax structure presented here is not meant to be exhaustive. There are a number of excellent income tax publications and computer programs that taxpayers can consult to obtain detailed information on the deductions, exemptions, and so on due them. Also some of the items and limits discussed here may be phased out in the future.

*Less:* Deductions to arrive at adjusted gross income (referred to in tax parlance as "deductions above the line"), including (but not limited to):

- N Trade or business expenses (not incurred as an employee)
- N Expenses of producing rents and royalties
- N Losses from sale or exchange of nonpersonal property
- N Contributions to retirement plans for self-employed persons, including HR-10 or Keogh plans, Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans, and Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers (SIMPLE) plans
- N Contributions to individual retirement accounts or annuities (IRAs) for eligible persons (i.e., contributions that are tax deductible, but not the non-tax-deductible contributions that may be permitted)
- N Alimony paid
- N Interest penalty on early withdrawal from time savings accounts
- N Contributions to health savings accounts (HSAs)
- N Moving expenses
- N Contributions to Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs)
- N Interest paid on "qualified education loans" with an annual limit and income limits
- N Qualified higher education expenses up to \$3,000 per year with income limits

*Equals:* Adjusted gross income (AGI).

*Less:* Itemized deductions,2 which are referred to as "deductions below the line" (or the standard deduction at the option of the taxpayer). The itemized deductions include:

- N Medical and dental expenses (in excess of 7.5 percent of AGI)
- N Nonbusiness taxes
- N Charitable contributions (subject to certain limitations described in Chapter 19)
- N Certain nonbusiness interest expense

Deductible interest for individuals includes *qualified residence interest*, which is mortgage interest on a taxpayer's principal residence and a second residence for acquisition or home equity indebtedness. *Acquisition indebtedness* is debt incurred to acquire, construct, or substantially improve a qualified residence. Refinanced debt is considered acquisition debt to the extent that it does not exceed the principal amount of acquisition debt immediately

2The overall amount of certain itemized deductions is phased out in the case of higher-income taxpayers.

before the refinancing. *Home equity indebtedness* is nonacqisition debt that does not exceed the fair market value of the qualified residence reduced by any acquisition indebtedness. There are dollar limits on the deductibility of such mortgage interest of \$1,000,000 on the aggregate amount of acquisition indebtedness and \$100,000 on the aggregate amount of home equity indebtedness. Interest on debt over these limits is not deductible. However, the dollar limit on acquisition indebtedness does not apply to debt incurred before October 14, 1987. But any such "grandfathered" acquisition indebtedness reduces the limit on new acquisition indebtedness.

However, *consumer interest or personal interest* (other than qualifying residence interest just described) is not deductible by individuals.

On the other hand, interest expense for loans on personal investments *investment interest* or *portfolio interest—*is deductible, but only to the extent of investment income (if the taxpayer itemizes).

- N Casualty losses (in excess of \$100 for each loss and 10 percent of AGI for all losses)
- N Miscellaneous deductions (in excess of 2 percent of AGI with certain exceptions)

*Less:* Personal exemptions.3

*Equals:* Taxable income.

*Federal income tax* (determined by applying income tax rates to taxable income).

*Less:* Credits (i.e., amounts deducted from the tax itself), including:

- N Credit for the elderly or permanently and totally disabled
- N Child care and care of disabled dependent or spouse credit
- N Child tax credit and adoption credit
- N Education credits (Hope credit and Lifetime Learning credit)
- N Earned income credit
- N Credit for qualified retirement savings contributions

*Equals:* Federal income tax payable.

*Plus:* Other taxes payable, including:

- N AMT to the extent that it exceeds the regular income tax
- N Self-employment tax (social security tax paid by the self-employed on their earnings subject to social security taxes)

*Equals:* Total federal taxes payable.

3As with certain itemized deductions, the overall amount of a taxpayer's personal and dependency exemptions are phased out for certain higher-income taxpayers.

## **Federal Income Tax Rates**

**Scheduled Tax Rates** As of this writing, under the EGTRRA of 2001 and subsequent tax laws, the federal income tax rates for various filing statuses (see later discussion of filing status) are 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, and 35 percent through 2010. For 2011 and thereafter, they are scheduled to "sunset" and return to the tax rates existing in 2001. Of course, new tax legislation may change this.

Thus, the *top nominal marginal* individual federal income tax rate now is 35 percent. The *average* income tax rate for a taxpayer is the total tax payable divided by the taxpayer's taxable income. For individuals, trusts, and estates, the average rate will always be less than the marginal rate. The top marginal rate normally is used for planning purposes. This assumes that the income or deductions being considered come at the top bracket, or are the last items received or paid. This assumption may tend to overstate the effect of taxes on ordinary income since the tax rates are quite progressive.

**Indirect Rate Increases** The situation becomes more complex, however, when we consider certain indirect rate factors. Certain itemized deductions (i.e., deductible taxes, deductible interest other than investment interest, charitable contributions, job expenses and most other miscellaneous deductions, and other miscellaneous deductions other than gambling losses) are phased out (not allowed) for higher-income taxpayers. For taxpayers in the phase-out range (AGI over \$166,800 for most taxpayers for 2009 taxes), the rate of reduction in these itemized deductions is 3 percent but no more than 80 percent of allowable itemized deductions. Therefore, the effective tax rate is the nominal rate increased by about 3 percent. For example, for taxpayers subject to phase-out who are in the 35 percent bracket, the effective federal tax rate (considering only the itemized deduction phase-out) would be 36.05 percent [35% + (3% × 35% or 1.05%) = 36.05%].

In addition, the Medicare tax rate, which is currently 1.45 percent (2.90 percent on earnings from self-employment), is now applied to all earned income without limit. Therefore, higher-income taxpayers effectively must pay an additional 1.45 percent (2.90 percent for self-employed persons) on *personal earnings* over the earnings cap.

Finally, personal and dependency exemptions are also phased out for higher-income taxpayers. This increases the actual tax rate for persons in the phase-out range.

**Trust Tax Rates** Most irrevocable trusts are taxed as separate entities with their own tax rates.4 Trust and estate tax brackets are steeply progressive. For example, in 2009, trust taxable income reaches the top tax bracket when it exceeds only \$11,150. This rapid progression of trust tax rates has planning implications. It may not be desirable tax-wise to accumulate sizeable amounts of taxable income in trusts. It may be better to have such income distributed currently to trust beneficiaries so it will be taxable to them at possibly lower brackets. Also, when trust income is to be accumulated (such as for a minor), it may be desirable to invest trust corpus so as to produce as little taxable income as possible (such as in municipal bonds, growth common stocks, or tax-deferred vehicles).

# **Filing Status**

There are separate federal income tax rate schedules for various categories of individual taxpayers. These include married individuals filing joint returns (and also a qualified surviving spouse during the first two years after the year in which the other spouse died), heads of households, single individuals, married individuals who elect to file separate returns, and estates and trusts. This is referred to as the taxpayer's *filing status.* Determining the appropriate filing status is one aspect of income tax planning.

# **Indexing for Inflation**

The tax law adjusts annually, for the effects of inflation, the individual tax brackets, standard deduction amounts, the amount of personal and dependency exemptions, the thresholds for phasing out certain itemized deductions and the personal and dependency exemptions, and certain other limits or features in the tax law. This is referred to as *indexing* the tax schedules and other amounts.

# **Taxation of Children and the Unearned Income of Certain Children (Kiddie Tax)**

When children receive income, it normally is taxable to the child at the child's tax rate. This has made planning to shift taxable income from higherbracket taxpayers to lower-bracket children (or to others in lower brackets) reasonably attractive.

4Depending on their terms, certain irrevocable trusts can be *grantor trusts.* These trusts are defined in IRC Sections 671 through 679. Grantor trusts are trusts whose assets (corpus) are deemed to be owned by the grantor or creator of the trust for federal income tax purposes only. Therefore, the income and deductions of grantor trusts are treated as income and deductions of the grantor and are taxable to or taken by him or her. Revocable trusts are an example of grantor trusts.

However, there are tax limitations on income shifting to lower-bracket children.5 First, the tax law provides that an individual who is eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's return may not take a personal exemption on his or her own return. Furthermore, such a dependent's standard deduction may not exceed the larger of (1) a specified amount, which is indexed for inflation, or (2) the dependent's earned income plus \$300 in 2009 (indexed), subject to the regular standard deduction limits.

Finally, there is the so-called kiddie tax. This novel concept provides that the net unearned income of children age 18 or younger, or under age 24 if the child is a full-time students, (unless the child's earned income exceeds onehalf of his or her support), is taxed to the child, but at the child's *parents'* top marginal federal income tax rate, assuming this rate is higher than the child's tax rate. However, this special rule can apply only when a child has unearned income in excess of a specified amount (\$1,900 for 2009), which is indexed for inflation. Therefore, normally there would be no income tax advantage in shifting unearned income that will be subject to this kiddie tax.6

However, despite these limitations, planning is still possible. For example, earned income can still be received by a child and taxed at the child's rate. Also, shifting unearned income over the annual limit can be delayed until after a child reaches age 19 or 24. Furthermore, income can be accumulated in a trust for the child (and hence be taxable to the trust rather than the child) until the child reaches one of these ages. In this case, however, the highly progressive tax rates applying to trusts must be considered. Planning may involve distributing just enough trust income to a child (or to a custodial account for the child) to avoid the kiddie tax while allowing the remainder to be accumulated and taxed to the trust. Finally, the investment of property transferred to minors under these ages can be planned to produce as little currently taxable unearned income as possible. Such investments might include growth common stocks, municipal bonds (such as zero coupon municipals), series EE or I U.S. savings bonds, and tax-deferred vehicles (such as life insurance).

### **Income in Respect of a Decedent (IRD)**

This is a commonly encountered but easily misunderstood concept. Income in respect of a decedent (IRD) will arise when a deceased person was entitled to items that would have been gross income for federal income tax purposes to the

<sup>5</sup>The subject of gifts to minors as part of estate planning is covered in Chapter 27.

<sup>6</sup>Parents in some cases may elect to include their children's unearned income over the greater of \$1,900 for 2009 or \$950 (the standard deduction) for 2009 in their own returns to avoid having to have the child file a return.

decedent, but which were not includable in the decedent's gross income for the year of his or her death. IRD items generally are treated as gross income to the recipients after the decedent's death. The recipients do *not* receive a step-up in basis following the decedent's death, as do capital assets at present.

There are numerous IRD items. Some common examples are:

- N Distributions after an employee's or former employee's death from qualified retirement plans. This is an important source of IRD in many cases.
- N Distributions from a decedent's IRA, other than a Roth IRA. This is another important source of IRD.
- N Distributions after an employee's or former employee's death from taxsheltered annuity [TSA or Section 403(b)] plans.
- N Accrued, and as yet untaxed, interest on U.S. savings bonds as of the death of the owner.
- N Death benefits under nonqualified deferred compensation plans.
- N Distributions of as yet untaxed investment income from investment annuity contracts after the death of the annuitant.
- N The taxable portion of payments made after death from sales made on the installment method.

An IRD item will not only produce gross income to the recipient of the item (e.g., a beneficiary or the decedent's estate or heirs), but it also will be included at full value in the decedent's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes (and counted for GST tax purposes as well). Thus, IRD items are heavily taxed at death. Some relief is provided, however, by allowing the recipient to take an itemized income tax deduction on his or her federal income tax return for any federal estate or GST tax attributable to the IRD item in the decedent's estate. The amount of this itemized deduction is determined by calculating the federal estate or GST tax payable with the IRD item included in the decedent's estate, and then calculating the estate or GST tax without the IRD item. The difference is the income tax deduction. Of course, if no federal estate or GST tax is payable, there will be no deduction.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that Joan Martin, who is divorced, is a participant in a qualified savings plan with a Section 401(k) option. She has a current account balance in the plan of \$200,000, and her adult daughter, Amy, is named as beneficiary in the event of Joan's death. Joan also has other property so that the total value will place her in a 45 percent top marginal federal estate tax bracket. Suppose now that Joan dies. Amy, as the plan's beneficiary, will receive the \$200,000 account balance, which is IRD to her. Furthermore, the \$200,000 is in Joan's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. Thus, the \$200,000 is gross income (ordinary income) to Amy in the year she receives it, but she will have an itemized deduction of \$90,000 for the estate tax attributable to the account balance.7 If Amy receives the account balance over more than one taxable year (such as over her life expectancy), she will receive gross income as it is paid out to her and also a proportional part of the itemized deduction each year.8

#### **Actual and Constructive Receipt of Income**

There are two generally accepted methods for recognizing income and expenses for income tax purposes. They are the cash basis and the accrual basis. Most individuals and many smaller businesses are cash-basis taxpayers.

For *cash-basis taxpayers,* items of income (or expenses) are considered received (or paid), and hence taxable for income tax purposes, in the year they are actually or constructively received. *Actual receipt* means a taxpayer is in actual possession of the income. *Constructive receipt* is when the income has been credited to the taxpayer or set apart for him or her so that the taxpayer can actually receive it at any time without any substantial limitation or restriction on the taxpayer's right to do so. For example, if Martha Jones is paid her salary this year and cashes her payroll check during the year, she is in actual receipt of the compensation this year and will be taxed on it this year. If, instead, Martha's employer this year places, say, 10 percent of her salary in an investment account in Martha's name from which she has the unrestricted right to withdraw the money at any time, Martha will be in constructive receipt of the 10 percent placed in this account even if she does not actually withdraw it this year.

This concept of constructive receipt can be important for planning purposes. Assume, for example, the same facts as just noted for Martha Jones, except that Martha will be entitled to the 10 percent of her salary placed in the investment account (and the earnings on the account) only in the event of her termination of employment, disability, death, the passage of time, or other substantial limitation or restriction. In this case, Martha would not be

<sup>7</sup>This assumes the full \$200,000 account balance falls in the 45 percent estate tax bracket in Joan's estate. There is no GST tax in this case because Amy is not a "skip person" with respect to Joan. (See Chapter 26 for an explanation of the GST tax and the definition of a skip person.) We are also assuming Joan has no income tax basis in her Section 401(k) plan.

<sup>8</sup> In planning for distributions from qualified retirement plans, a common strategy is to defer the distributions and the income taxes thereon for as long as possible under the circumstances. In this case, this would normally be for Amy's life expectancy. (See Chapter 16 for a discussion of planning for taking distributions from retirement plans.)

in constructive receipt this year of the 10 percent of her salary because her right to receive it was subject to a substantial limitation or restriction.9 She will be taxed only when the funds are actually paid to her or made available to her without restriction, which normally would be many years in the future. This is the principle underlying nonqualified deferred compensation plans offered by many employers to certain employees. The doctrine of constructive receipt applies only to cash-basis taxpayers.

For *accrual-basis taxpayers,* items of income are included in gross income for the year in which the right to receive the income becomes fixed and the amounts receivable become determinable with reasonable accuracy.

# **Assignment of Income**

In general, income from property is taxable to the owner of the property. Thus, if one wishes to transfer the income from property to another, ownership of the property must be transferred (given or sold) to the intended recipient or to a trust for the recipient.

Merely assigning only the income from property while retaining ownership will not shift the tax liability on that income to the donee. The tax liability will remain with the property's owner. Similarly, income from personal services (personal earnings) is taxable to the person rendering the services. The tax liability on personal earnings cannot be transferred to another by assigning the right to receive the earnings to the other person. To use the famous analogy of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, if one wishes to transfer the fruit from a tree (for tax purposes), one must transfer the whole tree.10

# **Capital Gains Taxation**

**General Considerations** Capital gains and losses are realized from the sale or exchange of capital assets. With some exceptions, capital assets include the property taxpayers own. Some examples are common stocks, bonds, preferred stocks, investment real estate, collectibles, partnership interests (generally), personal residences, and other personal assets. These gains and losses also are recognized in the year of the sale or exchange, unless there is some specific nonrecognition provision in the IRC that defers recognition. The common nonrecognition provisions are outlined in the next section. The difference between the amount realized from the sale or exchange and

<sup>9</sup> In general, an amount is not constructively received if it is only conditionally credited to the taxpayer, it is indefinite in amount, it is subject to substantial limitation or restriction, or the payer lacks funds.

<sup>10</sup> See *Lucas v. Earl,* 281 U.S. 111 (1930).

the adjusted basis of the asset in the hands of the taxpayer is the amount of the capital gain or loss.

**Amount Realized and Adjusted Basis** The *amount realized* generally is the value received from the sale or exchange of a capital asset.

It normally includes any cash received, the value of any property received, and any indebtedness assumed from the seller.

The *adjusted basis* depends on how the taxpayer acquired the property. In general, adjusted basis is determined in certain common situations as follows:

- N If a taxpayer originally purchased the property, its adjusted basis is its cost plus any purchase commissions.
- N If a taxpayer acquired appreciated property as a lifetime gift from another (i.e., the donor's basis is less than the property's fair market value), its adjusted basis for the donee is its basis in the hands of the donor (a carryover or substitute basis), plus any gift tax on unrealized appreciation of the gift property.

On the other hand, if the donor's basis is greater than the fair market value of the gift property (i.e., it is loss property), the donee's basis is the smaller of the fair market value or the donor's basis assuming the donee sells the property at a loss (i.e., for less than its fair market value at the time of the gift).

There is a carryover basis for gifts between married persons and for transfers of property incident to a divorce.

- N If a taxpayer inherited the property from a decedent, its adjusted basis at present is the property's fair market value at the date of death (or the alternative valuation date for federal estate tax purposes). This is the important step-up or step-down in income tax basis at death rule.
- N If a taxpayer receives new stock or securities in a tax-free reorganization or merger (as one of those tax-free reorganizations defined in the IRC), the new stock's or securities' basis will be the former basis of the stock or securities the taxpayer exchanged for the new stock or securities (a *carryover basis*).
- N If a person acquires a partnership interest by a contribution of property (including money) to the partnership, the basis of the person's interest in the partnership generally is the money contributed plus the adjusted basis to the contributing partner of the property contributed (a carryover basis from the property contributed).
- N If a partner receives a distribution of property in kind from his or her partnership, the partner takes the partnership's basis in the property (a carryover basis), but not greater than the partner's basis in his or her partnership interest.
- N If a person or persons transfer property to a corporation solely in exchange for stock in such corporation, and immediately after the exchange, the

person or persons have control of the corporation (at least 80 percent ownership), the basis of the person's stock in such corporation generally is the same as the basis of the property transferred.

- N If a person or entity owns an interest in a pass-through business entity (i.e., partnerships, S corporations, or LLCs), his or her basis in the interest will be adjusted to reflect the profits, losses, and other operations of the pass-through entity. (See Chapter 31 for a more complete description of these entities.)
- N A taxpayer may increase his or her adjusted basis in property by the cost of any improvements and reduce it by any depreciation, depletion, or amortization.

These statements do not include all of the situations or rules for determining basis. They are intended to be representative of common situations. Other rules for determining basis are discussed elsewhere in this book. Finally, a taxpayer may increase his or her basis at sale or exchange by any expenses of sale (such as brokers' fees, commissions, transfer taxes, and the like), unless these expenses were taken from the amount realized.

**Calculation of Capital Gains and Losses** *Net capital gains* are net long-term capital gains (long-term capital gains minus long-term capital losses) minus any net short-term capital losses (short-term capital losses minus short-term capital gains). For this purpose, short-term capital gains and losses are those gains and losses on capital assets held for one year or less; the taxpayer first determines any net short-term capital gain or loss for the year. Long-term capital gains and losses are those gains and losses on capital assets held for more than one year; the taxpayer determines any net long-term capital gain or loss for the year. Thus, under this system, capital losses offset capital gains and, to the extent of \$3,000 per year, other ordinary income of the taxpayer.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume a taxpayer had the following gains and losses during a year:

| Long-term capital gains   | \$12,000 |  |
|---------------------------|----------|--|
| Long-term capital losses  | \$3,000  |  |
| Short-term capital gains  | \$1,000  |  |
| Short-term capital losses | \$2,500  |  |

Thus, this taxpayer has net long-term capital gains of \$9,000 (\$12,000 – \$3,000), net short-term capital losses of \$1,500 (\$2,500 – \$1,000), and net capital gains of \$7,500 (\$9,000 – \$1,500). The importance of this calculation is that as of this writing the tax rate on capital gains for individuals is 15 percent (or 5 percent for individual taxpayers in the 10 and 15 percent brackets), while the rate on ordinary income and net short-term capital gains can be as high as 35 percent.

As just noted, capital losses are first used to offset capital gains of the same type and then any net capital loss (short-term or long-term) can be used to reduce the taxpayer's other ordinary income, dollar for dollar, up to a maximum of \$3,000 in any one year. Any unused net capital losses may be carried forward by the taxpayer indefinitely and used in future years, first to offset any capital gains, and then to offset ordinary income, up to \$3,000 per year.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose Harry Baker had the following capital gains and losses on his stock and bond transactions this year:

| Long-term capital gains   | \$1,000  |
|---------------------------|----------|
| Short-term capital gains  | \$2,000  |
| Short-term capital losses | \$15,000 |

In addition, Harry and his wife had other ordinary taxable income of \$250,000. Harry first can offset his capital gains against his capital losses so that he has a net capital loss for the year of \$12,000. He then can use up to \$3,000 of this net capital loss to reduce the other ordinary taxable income. Since Harry and his wife file a joint return and are in a 33 percent top marginal tax bracket, this would be worth \$990 in income tax saving this year. Also, they can carry the remaining \$9,000 of net capital loss forward to the next and subsequent tax years. Thus, a taxpayer with capital losses can use these losses to save on income taxes by realizing them at the proper time. This is sometimes called *tax loss selling.*

**Tax Rates on Capital Gains** At present, the tax rate for individuals on net capital gains generally is 15 percent, except for taxpayers in the 10 and 15 percent brackets for ordinary income, in which case the rate is 5 percent. However, for 2008 through 2010, the 5 percent rate becomes 0 (i.e., no tax on net capital gains). Under EGTRRA and subsequent laws, these rates will "sunset" in 2011 and become rates as of 2001 unless the law is changed before then.

There are some exceptions to these capital gains tax rates. One is that net capital gains on collectibles (art, coins, stamps, etc.) are taxed at a maximum rate of 28 percent. Also, for sales or taxable exchanges of certain depreciable real estate (such as residential rental property), the portion of the net capital gain attributable to allowable depreciation is taxed at a maximum rate of 25 percent, as illustrated in Chapter 6. Net short-term capital gains are taxed at the same rates as ordinary income.

**Constructive Sales** Normally, a capital gain or loss is not realized and recognized for tax purposes until there has been a sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition of a capital asset. At this point, the difference between the amount realized and the adjusted basis of the asset is the capital gain or loss.

However, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 introduced a new concept of constructive sales of appreciated financial positions. The idea behind this provision is generally to prohibit the use of certain hedging techniques that essentially allowed holders of highly appreciated assets (mainly securities) to eliminate the risk of owning the securities without actually selling the securities and realizing a sizeable capital gain. Thus, realizing the gain could be deferred or perhaps even eliminated (through the step-up in basis at death rule or other techniques). Under the constructive sale rules, however, transactions that use these techniques are considered sales and are taxed at the time of sale.

For this purpose, an *appreciated financial position* is a position in any stock, debt instrument, or partnership interest (with certain exceptions) where there would be a gain if the position were sold or otherwise terminated at its fair market value. A *constructive sale* of an appreciated financial position is considered to occur if the holder (or a related person) (1) enters into a *short sale* of the same or substantially identical property (in effect, selling short against the box), (2) enters into an *offsetting notional principal contract* (a *swap*) with respect to the same or substantially identical property, (3) enters into a *futures or forward contract* to deliver the same or substantially identical property, (4) has entered into one of the previous transactions and acquires the same property as the underlying property in the position, or (5) to the extent prescribed in regulations, enters into other transactions with substantially the same effect as the transactions previously named.

This provision has essentially eliminated several formerly popular techniques (particularly selling short against the box) for deferring and perhaps eliminating significant capital gains.11 However, some other techniques still may be available. They are discussed in Chapter 11.

<sup>11</sup>The law does provide that certain short-term hedges that close before the end of 30 days after the tax year in which the transaction was entered into and where the taxpayer is at risk on the appreciated financial position for an additional 60 days will not be considered constructive sales. However, this "safe harbor" is expected to be of limited usefulness to taxpayers.

# **Nonrecognition Provisions**

It was noted at the beginning of this discussion that capital gains are realized as a result of the sale or exchange of a capital asset and also are recognized for tax purposes in the year of the sale or exchange, unless there is a specific provision in the tax code that defers recognition. Such provisions are called *nonrecognition provisions.* The effect of a nonrecognition provision is to defer income taxation on any gain to some future transaction or event when, depending on the property involved and the circumstances, there may or may not be a tax due.

When a nonrecognition provision applies, there normally is a *carryover of income tax basis* from the property sold or exchanged to the new property acquired, so, in effect, the new property takes the old property's basis. In this way, the nonrecognized gain is not forgiven; it is simply deferred until some future transaction or event. Nonrecognition provisions can be important in financial planning. Some of the more commonly used nonrecognition provisions are briefly listed here to illustrate the concept.

- N *Section 1031: Exchange of property held for productive use or investment.* These exchanges are referred to as *like-kind exchanges* and are used for property held in a trade or business, or for investment, with certain exceptions. The exceptions include the important categories of stocks, bonds, notes, and other securities or evidences of indebtedness. These categories of assets are not eligible for like-kind exchange treatment. Like-kind exchanges are commonly used for investment real estate, as explained in Chapter 6.
- N *Section 1035: Certain exchanges of insurance policies.* While it does not involve capital gains, this important provision states that no gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of certain life insurance policies or the exchange of certain annuity contracts.
- N *Section 354: Exchanges of stock and securities in certain reorganizations.* This and other code provisions allow stockholders to exchange their stock for other stock, with no gain or loss being recognized, in the case of certain corporate reorganizations and mergers, as specified in the IRC. It permits tax-free reorganizations and mergers in these cases.
- N *Section 351: Transfer to corporation controlled by transferor.* This provision permits a tax-free exchange of appreciated property for corporate stock if the combined transferors are in control of the corporation immediately thereafter. This nonrecognition provision is important in the formation of corporations.
- N *Section 721: Nonrecognition of gain or loss on contribution to a partnership.*  This provision permits a tax-free exchange of appreciated property for a partnership interest upon contribution of the property to the partnership.

This provision is important in the formation of, and in adding partners to, partnerships. It also can be significant in other areas, such as the creation of family limited partnerships and the use of exchange funds for deferring gains on securities.

- N *Section 1041: Transfers of property between spouses or incident to divorce.*  This provision specifies that no gain or loss shall be recognized on a transfer of property from an individual to his or her spouse or to his or her former spouse, provided in the case of a former spouse the transfer is incident to a divorce. This nonrecognition provision permits the tax-free sale of property between spouses and the tax-free transfer of property from one spouse to another as part of a divorce settlement.
- N *Section 1036: Stock for stock of same corporation.* This provides that no gain or loss shall be recognized if common stock in a corporation is exchanged solely for common stock in the same corporation, or if preferred stock in a corporation is exchanged solely for preferred stock in the same corporation. This nonrecognition provision can be used, for example, to allow use of previously owned common stock in a corporation to exercise a stock option for common stock in the same corporation. Such an exchange will defer any gain in the previously owned stock.
- N *Section 1042: Sales of stock to employee stock ownership plans or certain cooperatives.* This provision allows nonrecognition of gain on the sale of non-publicly–traded employer securities to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), under certain conditions. It allows stockowners of closely held C corporations to defer capital gains by selling their appreciated stock to their corporation's ESOP.

# **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) for Individuals**

An AMT may be imposed on individual taxpayers, estates, and trusts with certain tax preference items and adjustments.12 This minimum tax applies if it exceeds a taxpayer's regular income tax.

**Calculation of the AMT** The AMT is calculated by starting with a taxpayer's regular taxable income for the year. To this amount certain tax preference items are added back, and certain adjustments are added to or subtracted from it to arrive at the taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) for the year. It may be noted that adjustments are different from tax preferences. Adjustments may involve only differences in timing for AMT and regular tax purposes, while preferences always increase AMTI.

<sup>12</sup>Taxable corporations may be subject to a corporate AMT, which is discussed later in this chapter.

Some common adjustments in arriving at AMTI include the following: (1) adding back personal and dependency exemptions, which are not allowed for AMT purposes; (2) adding back certain itemized deductions, which are not allowed or are cut back for AMT purposes (such as income and property taxes imposed by state and local governments, home equity loan interest on loans up to \$100,000, employee business expenses deductible for regular tax purposes, and otherwise deductible medical expenses up to 10 percent of AGI); (3) adding back the standard deduction for those who do not itemize (the standard deduction is not allowed for AMT purposes); (4) adding the amount by which the value of stock purchased under incentive stock option (ISO) plans exceeds the option price; and (5) various other items.

The tax preferences that are added to regular taxable income to arrive at AMTI include: (1) otherwise tax-free interest on certain private-activity municipal bonds (AMT bonds) issued after August 7, 1986 (see Chapter 7, but this preference is suspended for 2009 and 2010); (2) accelerated depreciation on property placed in service before 1987; (3) 7 percent of the otherwise excluded gain from the sale of qualified newly issued small business stock held for at least five years; and (4) certain other items.

An AMT exemption amount, which is based on the taxpayer's filing status, then is deducted from AMTI. This amount was \$69,950 for married taxpayers filing jointly and surviving spouses, and \$46,200 for single taxpayers and heads of households for 2008.

However, this exemption is phased out when AMTI reaches certain levels. For example, for married taxpayers filing jointly, the exemption is reduced by 25 percent of the amount by which AMTI exceeds \$150,000. The AMT rates are applied to the amount resulting from these calculations. These rates are 26 percent of the first \$175,000 and 28 percent for amounts above \$175,000. The taxpayer then subtracts his or her regular income tax liability for the year from this amount. If the result is positive, the excess over the regular tax is the AMT owed for the year.

Finally, there is a *minimum tax credit* (MTC) that taxpayers may be able to take against their regular income tax only for AMT paid on AMT items involving timing differences (such as on ISOs at exercise) when future regular tax exceeds future AMT.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume that John and Mary Costa file a joint return and have regular taxable income for federal income tax purposes of \$160,000 and that their regular federal income tax payable on this amount for the year is \$37,926. In arriving at their taxable income, the Costas took personal and dependency exemptions, an itemized deduction for state and local income and property taxes, and an itemized deduction for interest on a home equity mortgage loan. The total for these exemptions and itemized deductions is \$26,000. In addition, this year John exercised ISOs that his employer had granted to him nine years ago for 500 shares of employer stock at an exercise price of \$20 per share. The fair market value of the stock at exercise was \$80 per share. Finally, a municipal bond mutual fund that the Costas own reported that \$2,000 of the dividends credited to them during the year were from AMT bonds.

Given these facts, the calculation of the Costas' AMT in 2008 would be as follows:

| Regular taxable income | \$160,000  |
|------------------------|------------|
| AMT adjustments        | + 56,00013 |
| AMT preferences        | + 2,00014  |
| AMTI                   | \$218,000  |
| AMT exemption          | – 52,95015 |
|                        | \$165,050  |
| Tax (\$165,050 × 0.26) | 42,913     |
| Regular tax liability  | – 37,926   |
|                        | \$4,987    |
|                        |            |

The Costas must pay a total tax for the year of \$42,913 (\$37,926 regular tax + \$4,987 AMT).

**AMT Planning** Taxpayers may wish to time certain transactions (such as the exercise of ISOs) so that they will not produce AMT or produce as little AMT as possible. Of course, the AMT may be only one factor in such decisions. Persons who are likely to be subject to the AMT normally should not invest in AMT bonds or in mutual funds that have significant positions in such bonds. Also, taxpayers should make sure to take advantage of the MTC against the regular tax when it is available.

Additional planning ideas regarding stock options and the AMT are presented in Chapter 18.

13These would be the total of \$26,000 of personal and dependency exemptions, state and local income and property taxes, and interest on the home equity mortgage loan, plus the \$30,000 bargain element on the exercise of the ISOs. This bargain element is the difference between the fair market value of the stock at exercise and the exercise price paid (\$80 per share – \$20 per share × 500 shares = \$30,000).

14This is the AMT bond interest. This amount would not be included for 2009 and 2010.

15This is the \$69,950 exemption amount for married taxpayers filing a joint return for 2008 reduced by 25 percent of the amount by which AMTI exceeds \$150,000 (\$218,000 – \$150,000 = \$68,000 × 0.25 = \$17,000; \$69,950 – \$17,000 = \$52,950 AMT exemption in this example).

# **The Federal Income Tax on Corporations**

Taxable corporations have their own federal income tax structure.16 They also are subject to state (and perhaps local) income taxes in many states.

## **What Is a Taxable Corporation?**

While this seems like a relatively simple question, it has not always been so in practice. However, with the "check-the-box" regulations issued by the IRS and effective January 1, 1997, this issue has been simplified for many entities.

A corporation that is incorporated under a state statute and that has not elected for S corporation status will be taxable as a corporation under the IRC. Correspondingly, a corporation that has elected for S corporation status will not be taxed as a corporation. It will have pass-through status, as described in the next section. Finally, most unincorporated businesses, such as partnerships and LLCs, can simply elect under the check-the-box regulations whether they wish to be taxed as corporations or as partnerships. If no election is made, it is presumed they have elected to be taxed as partnerships. These regulations have simplified this matter considerably for most unincorporated businesses.17

## **Basic Corporate Income Tax Structure**

C corporations must pay tax on their taxable income at corporate income tax rates. The C corporation itself is a separate tax-paying entity apart from its shareholders. A C corporation's *taxable income* is its gross income subject to tax minus deductions allowable to corporations. For example, corporations normally may deduct their ordinary and necessary business expenses, with some exceptions. However, a corporation's taxable income may not be the

16The corporate tax rules are found in Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, corporations that are subject to federal income taxation are commonly called *C corporations.*  On the other hand, the rules for electing small business corporations that have opted not to be taxed as corporations are found in Subchapter S of the IRC. Hence, they are commonly called *S corporations.*

17Formerly, if an unincorporated business (such as an LLC) had more corporate characteristics than noncorporate characteristics, the IRS would seek to tax it as an association taxable as a corporation (i.e., it would be subject to the corporate income tax, which generally is undesirable). There were four significant corporate characteristics in this regard: limited liability, centralized management, continuity of life, and free transferability of ownership interests. Thus, if an unincorporated business had any three of these four characteristics, it would be taxed as a corporation; if it had two or fewer, it would be taxed as a partnership. This resulted in a facts-and-circumstances test for most unincorporated businesses, which could cause uncertainty and complexity. Fortunately, these problems generally have been eliminated by the check-the-box regulations.

same as its income reported to shareholders (book income), because some items of corporate income may not be subject to tax and some deductions may not be allowable for tax purposes.

A C corporation may have an operating loss when its business deductions exceed its business gross income, with certain adjustments. This is referred to as a *net operating loss (NOL).* A corporation (as well as most taxpayers carrying on a trade or business) may carry back an NOL to each of the two preceding years and then any remaining loss may be carried forward to each of the following 20 years. Note, however, that these losses can be used to offset only corporate profits, not the income of the individual shareholders.

Corporations can also have capital gains and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets. C corporations, however, can deduct capital losses only to the extent they have capital gains. Any unused net capital loss from a year can be carried back to each of the three preceding years and then any remaining loss can be carried forward to each of the five following years. The tax rate on net capital gains is the same as for other corporate taxable income.

The fact that the C corporations are separate tax-paying entities gives rise to the well-known *double taxation of C corporation income.* The taxable income of a C corporation is subject to corporate income tax. Then, to the extent a C corporation pays dividends to its shareholders from its after-tax income, those dividends are again taxed to the shareholders individually as dividend income. The corporation gets no tax deduction for dividends paid as it does for interest paid to its bondholders.

## **Corporate Income Tax Rates**

Under the corporate tax system, unlike the tax rates for individuals, surtaxes are imposed at certain levels of corporate income to phase out the benefits of lower corporate tax brackets. Following are the federal tax rates for C corporations.

| Taxable Income (Brackets) |     | Tax Rates                         |
|---------------------------|-----|-----------------------------------|
| \$0–\$50,000              | 15% |                                   |
| \$50,000–\$75,000         | 25% |                                   |
| \$75,000–\$100,000        | 34% |                                   |
| \$100,000–\$335,000       | 39% | (34% + 5% surtax to phase out     |
|                           |     | benefits of 15% and 25% brackets) |
| \$335,000–\$10,000,000    | 34% |                                   |
| \$10,000,000–\$15,000,000 | 35% |                                   |
| \$15,000,000–\$18,333,333 | 38% | (35% + 3% surtax to phase out     |
|                           |     | benefits of 34% bracket)          |
| Over \$18,333,333         | 35% | (Flat tax on all taxable income)  |

# **Other Corporate Taxes**

In addition to the regular corporate income tax, several other federal taxes may apply to C corporations.

**Accumulated Earnings Tax** This tax is intended to apply to corporations that have accumulated earnings inside the corporation to avoid income taxation on dividends that might otherwise have been paid to shareholders. It applies only to earnings and profits that are accumulated beyond the reasonable needs of the business. There is an accumulated earnings credit, which is the greater of (1) earnings and profits accumulated during the year for the reasonable needs of the business or (2) \$250,000. Thus, only accumulated income that exceeds a minimum of \$250,000 per year is potentially subject to this tax. Furthermore, payment of dividends will reduce accumulated taxable income. The accumulated earnings tax rate, which is the top rate for individual taxpayers, is applied to accumulated taxable income. Any accumulated earnings tax is paid in addition to the regular corporate income tax.

**AMT** Taxable corporations are subject to their own AMT. It generally operates like the individual AMT, except that some adjustments and preferences are different and the minimum tax credit against the regular tax is allowed for the entire corporate AMT liability. The corporate AMT exemption is \$40,000 and is phased out at various income levels. The tax rate is a flat 20 percent. A corporation pays AMT only when it exceeds its regular tax liability.

The corporate AMT does not apply to small business corporations for taxable years beginning after 1997. For this purpose, a "small business corporation" generally is one that has average gross receipts no greater than \$5 million for three consecutive taxable years beginning after 1994. Once the \$5 million test is met, the corporation will continue to be a small business corporation as long as its average gross receipts do not exceed \$7.5 million.

**Special Forms of Corporations for Tax Purposes** There are a variety of such corporations. For example, in the case of *personal service corporations*  (a corporation whose principal activity is the performance of personal services and such services are substantially performed by employee-owners of the corporation and whose principal purpose is avoiding taxes) the IRS may reallocate tax benefits of such corporations between the corporation and its employee-owners under certain conditions. Also, *personal holding companies*  (PHCs) are corporations whose income is mainly (60 percent or more) from personal holding company income (dividends, interest, rents, royalties, annuities, payments under personal service contracts, taxable income from estates and trusts, etc.) and where more than 50 percent of its stock is owned by five or fewer individuals. A 15 percent surtax is imposed on the undistributed personal holding company income of a PHC in addition to the regular corporate income tax.

Furthermore, there are regulated investment companies (e.g., mutual funds), which were discussed in Chapter 8; REITs, which were covered in Chapter 6; and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs)*.* These are essentially pass-through corporations for their shareholders. S corporations are covered in the next section as a pass-through entity.

# **Pass-Through Business Entities**

These are entities that are not themselves taxable, but rather report their profits, losses, and other tax items to their owners, who pay taxes on them or deduct them on the owners' individual tax returns. They are tax-reporting but not tax-paying entities.

## **Partnerships**

For tax purposes, a partnership generally is a syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization through which any business, financial operation, or venture is carried on and that is not a trust, estate, or corporation. It usually exists when two or more persons join together to carry on a trade or business and to share profits and losses as agreed, and with each contributing cash, property, or services to form the partnership. Aside from taxation, there are state law definitions of partnerships, often coming from the Uniform Revised Partnership Act and the Uniform Revised Limited Partnership Act.

A partnership itself does not pay taxes, but rather reports each partner's *distributive share* of the partnership's taxable income or loss, as well as certain separately stated items to the partner. The partner then includes this distributive share (whether or not any distributions are actually paid to the partner) in the partner's income and any other tax items on his or her own return. A partner also is taxed on any guaranteed payments (e.g., salary) paid to him or her by the partnership. Partnerships may be general partnerships, limited partnerships (LPs), or limited liability partnerships (LLPs). They are all taxed under the same tax rules.

A special kind of partnership for tax purposes is the *publicly traded partnership* (PTP) or *master limited partnership.* A partnership is a PTP if interests in the partnership are traded on an established securities market or on a substantially equivalent secondary market. The general rule is that PTPs are taxed like corporations. However, there are significant exceptions to this. For example, if 90 percent or more of a PTP's gross income comes from passive sources (e.g., rent, interest, dividends, or mining and natural resource income), it will be taxed as a partnership. Also, beginning in 1998, if a PTP existing in 1987 elects to pay a 3.5 percent tax on its gross income from the active conduct of a trade or business, it will not be taxed as a corporation. Some large corporations have spun off certain of their operations into PTPs, in which investors can purchase limited partnership interests on organized securities markets.

# **S Corporations**

Eligible domestic corporations can elect (with the initial consent of all shareholders) to be taxed under Subchapter S of the IRC, rather than Subchapter C, and hence not pay any corporate income tax. The profits, losses, and other tax items of an S corporation are passed through to the shareholders in proportion to their stockholdings and are taxable to them on their own individual returns. This is true whether the shareholders receive any dividends or not. In all other respects, an S corporation is organized like any other corporation under state law.

Only some corporations are eligible to make an S election. These eligibility requirements are noted in Chapter 31; however, generally speaking, smaller, closely held corporations can elect S corporation status.

# **Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)**

These are a relatively new kind of business entity. The owners are called *members,* and the LLC is managed by its members or by a manager. LLCs are organized by filing articles of organization with a state. All states now have statutes allowing LLCs. The unique characteristics of LLCs are that their members can manage the entity, have limited liability for the debts and obligations of the LLC, and generally can elect to be taxed like partnerships for federal income tax purposes under the check-the-box regulations.

# **Federal Income Taxation of Trusts and Estates**

Estates and many trusts are taxed as separate entities with their own tax rate schedule. The rules regarding taxation of trusts and estates are complex and are only briefly reviewed here.

A *trust* is a fiduciary arrangement whereby a person (the grantor or creator) transfers property (the corpus) to a trustee (a fiduciary and "legal owner" of the trust property) to be administered under the terms of the trust for the benefit of trust beneficiaries (who are the "equitable owners" of the trust corpus). The corpus of a trust normally will produce income and perhaps capital gains, and the issue here is how such income and capital gains will be taxed for federal income tax purposes. Depending on the terms of a trust, trust income may be taxed to the trust, the trust beneficiaries, or the grantor of the trust.

# **Grantor Trusts**

A *grantor trust* is one whose income is taxed to and whose deductions may be taken by the grantor, creator, or settlor of the trust, regardless of whether the grantor receives such income. The various kinds of powers over a trust possessed by the grantor (or in some cases by a "nonadverse party") that will cause the trust to be a grantor trust are spelled out in Sections 673 through 677 of the IRC and are called the *grantor trust rules.* In general, these powers include the power to revoke, alter, or amend the trust; the power to control beneficial enjoyment of the trust; use of trust income for the benefit of the grantor, a greater than 5 percent reversionary interest in the grantor; and certain administrative powers. The idea is that the grantor should be treated as the owner of a trust's corpus for income tax purposes (and hence be taxable on trust income and eligible for trust deductions) when the grantor can benefit from the trust or has too much power over the trust, as defined in the grantor trust rules.

It should be noted that the grantor trust rules just described for federal income tax purposes may be different from the rules regarding inclusion or noninclusion of a trust's corpus in the grantor's (or a beneficiary's) gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. Thus, sometimes a trust is deliberately structured to be a grantor trust for income tax purposes, but also structured so that the corpus will not be included in the grantor's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. These are called *intentionally defective grantor trusts* and they may have several estate planning uses as described in Chapter 27*.*

## **Simple and Complex Trusts**

**General Tax Principles** These are irrevocable trusts that are not grantor trusts. As a general principle, the income of such trusts is taxable to the beneficiaries to the extent it is distributed to them, and the trust gets a corresponding income tax deduction for such distributions. However, the gross income of trust beneficiaries and a trust's deduction for distributions to beneficiaries are limited by the trust's distributable net income (DNI) for the year (not counting items not included in the trust's gross income for tax purposes, such as tax-exempt interest on municipal bonds). Taxable income that is accumulated in a trust is taxed to the trust itself at the trust's rates.

A trust has an income tax basis in the property held by the trust, just as individuals do. Essentially, a trust's basis is determined in the same ways as for individuals. Trusts may realize and recognize capital gains on sales or exchanges of their property. Under the Revised Uniform Principal and Income Act (which has been adopted by most states), unless the trust document provides otherwise, capital gains are allocated to principal (corpus) and are not included in income for trust accounting purposes. They are then taxed to the trust. Of course, capital gains can be distributed to and be taxable to trust beneficiaries if the trust document so provides or if state law permits unitrust payments from a trust, as explained in Chapter 25.

When a trust distributes income with a special tax status, such as taxexempt municipal bond interest, the income retains that status in the hands of a beneficiary. Thus, the trust beneficiary can exclude such items from his or her own gross income for tax purposes.

The overall idea underlying the income taxation of trusts is that trust income is taxed only once—to the beneficiaries if distributed, to the trust if accumulated, or possibly partly to each if distributed in part and accumulated in part.

**Simple Trusts** These are trusts that must distribute all income currently, whose trustee does not distribute corpus currently, and that have no charitable beneficiaries. In this case, the beneficiaries are taxed on the current income distributed and the trust gets a tax deduction for those distributions.

**Complex Trusts and Estates** Complex trusts are those that are not simple trusts or grantor trusts. They include trusts where income can be accumulated, where corpus is distributed, or that have charitable beneficiaries. Thus, trusts that give the trustee discretion to pay out or to accumulate current income and to distribute corpus to beneficiaries would be complex trusts for tax purposes. The income of complex trusts and estates may be taxed to the beneficiaries, who receive distributions, or to the trust or estate, depending on the circumstances.

# **State and Local Income Taxes**

In addition to the federal income tax system just outlined, many states and some cities and other localities levy personal income taxes or wage taxes on individuals. They also may levy corporate income taxes.

State personal income taxes vary greatly. Most states have graduated rates like the federal system, but some have flat rates on all taxable income. The top effective tax rate varies among the states, from as low as 2 percent to as high as 10 percent (without counting local income or wage taxes). Some states do not have any income tax.
