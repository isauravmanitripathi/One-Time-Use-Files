## **Asset Allocation Strategies and Financial Management**

*Competence Objectives for This Chapter* After reading this chapter, planners should understand:

- N Use of investment policy statements
- N The personal factors involved in asset allocation
- N Possible asset classes and investment vehicles for asset allocation
- N Asset allocations within investment classes
- N How asset classes should be held (location analysis)
- N Some illustrations of asset allocation strategies
- N Cash flow management and budgeting
- N Some strategies for promoting individual savings
- N Types of debt and some debt management strategies
- N Use of reverse mortgages to provide retirement income

## **Fundamentals of Asset Allocation**

Asset allocation is a system for determining what percentages of an investment portfolio should be in different asset classes and subclasses. The system is based on the expected after-tax total returns on various asset classes and their correlations, the investor's financial situation, the time horizon involved, personal factors and investment constraints, the person's investment objectives and policies, and the person's ability to tolerate risk (volatility of returns).

## **Steps in the Asset Allocation Process**

The following are possible steps in this process:

- 1. Develop an investment policy statement.
- 2. Consider the investor's personal situation, including investment constraints, time horizon, financial position, tax status, and liquidity and marketability needs.
- 3. Consider the person's investment objectives and strategies.
- 4. Review the investor's present asset allocation.
- 5. Consider and select the asset classes deemed suitable for the particular investor's allocation.
- 6. Estimate, to the extent possible, the long-term return-risk features of the asset classes selected. Logically, this step might be done concurrently with the preceding one since long-term return-risk characteristics are important in deciding which asset classes to include in a portfolio.
- 7. Consider the current and expected economic climate.
- 8. Decide on the percentage allocations of the selected asset classes in the portfolio. This, of course, is the critical step.
- 9. Decide on suballocations within each asset class selected.
- 10. Consider, to the extent possible, how the various asset classes should be held (i.e., directly owned, through financial intermediaries, or in taxadvantaged accounts or plans).
- 11. Implement the plan.
- 12. Periodically review and reevaluate the plan.

## **Investment Policy Statements**

It is desirable for investors and their advisers to develop a formal *investment policy statement* to help guide the investor's asset allocation and other investment decisions. Such a statement might include:

- N Asset classes deemed suitable for the portfolio
- N Asset allocation targets for the approved asset classes
- N Personal factors and attitudes affecting the investor's portfolio and his or her time horizons
- N Risk-return considerations for the investor and desired overall after-tax rate of return desired; this may include an estimate of how much of a portfolio decline (e.g., during a "bear market") the investor feels he or she can tolerate
- N Diversification standards to be followed

- N Cash flow requirements from the portfolio
- N Portfolio liquidity and marketability requirements

## **Personal Factors and Asset Allocation**

**Overall Financial Situation and Tax Status** As for most forms of financial planning, one's personal or family financial situation—personal balance sheet and cash flow statement—is a valuable starting point. Tax status also is important since it is the after-tax returns from investments that are critical.

**Time Horizon** The longer the time horizon, the more discretion and flexibility there can be in asset allocation. There are several reasons for this. First, the long-term total return and variability data for common stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents (from such studies as those discussed in Chapter 5), which are so important in modern asset allocation thinking, are based on long-term historical studies for those asset classes. Hence, they need a long investment horizon in which to work. Second, since no one can be sure when short-term economic declines or personal problems may arise, it seems prudent to be ready for them today. Therefore, if one has only a short time (such as up to five years) to prepare for an economic need, such as college expenses, a more conservative asset allocation strategy may be in order, at least until the short-term need is met.

**Investment Constraints, Investor Attitudes, and Other Factors** Here are some investment constraints and other factors that might be considered:

- N The investor's ability to risk loss of investment income and principal. This, in turn, is influenced by a number of factors, such as:
  - Personal earnings and the nature and stability of his or her employment, as well as the personal earnings, if any, of his or her spouse
  - Other sources of income
  - Age, health, family responsibilities, and other obligations
  - Ownership of closely held business interests
  - Any likely (or possible) inheritances
  - Plans to use investment principal for particular purposes, such as education expenses, retirement, or other large expenditures
  - The extent to which current investment income is needed for living expenses
- N The degree of liquidity and marketability needed in the portfolio.
- N How well the investor is able to weather the ups and particularly the downs in the securities markets.
- N The quality of available investment management services.
- N The investor's attitudes and emotional tolerance for risk.

## **Investment Objectives**

Making investment decisions without defining the person's objectives is like trying to steer a ship without a rudder. Also, people's investment objectives normally change over their lifecycles and as circumstances change. Finally, a person may have a combination of objectives at the same time. The following can be listed as typical investment objectives.

**Maximum Current Income** This objective emphasizes current yield over other factors. It is typical of people who must rely on investment income for part or all of their livelihood.

**Preservation of Capital** This is a commonly heard objective. In its purest form, it means that the dollar value of the portfolio should not fall. This is a rather rigorous form of this objective. In a more flexible form, it means investing so that the potential for declines in the overall value of the portfolio is within tolerable limits. In this form, it is a common and quite logical objective.

**Reasonable Current Income with Moderate Capital Growth** This modifies the first objective, in that current investment income is not the only aim. While current income is important, capital gains also are sought.

**Long-Term Capital Growth** This objective aims primarily at capital gains over a relatively long time. It may be typical of investors who do not need current investment income to meet their living expenses. This objective implies a greater degree of risk in the portfolio.

**Aggressive Capital Growth** This objective seeks maximum capital growth and implies making riskier investments with considerable investment analysis and management.

**Tax-Advantaged Investments** A person's top marginal income tax bracket may make tax-free or tax-sheltered investments attractive.

### **Investment Policies and Strategies**

Investors should establish policies and strategies to meet their objectives within the framework of their investment constraints. In setting such policies and strategies, the following kinds of issues might be considered.

**Aggressive versus Defensive Policies** *Aggressive policies* seek to maximize returns and, thus, accept above-average risks. On the other hand, *defensive policies* seek to minimize investment risks and, perhaps, accept correspondingly lower returns. In general, aggressive and defensive policies can be distinguished as follows. To maximize returns, an aggressive portfolio includes securities of greater financial risk than would be true of a defensive portfolio. Again, to earn maximum returns, an aggressive investor tries to make profits by timing purchases and sales of securities according to his or her views on how the market will go. A defensive investor, on the other hand, tends to follow a buy-and-hold philosophy or use dollar-cost averaging or other such plans, pursues index investing, and usually does not try to outguess the market. An aggressive investor may use many techniques and investment media, such as stock warrants, puts and calls, IPOs, and short sales, that often are not used in portfolios that are more defensive. An aggressive policy may involve borrowing to increase profit potential, while a defensive policy generally does not use credit in this way. Finally, an aggressive policy may concentrate purchases in a relatively small number of securities to maximize the investor's skill at selection.

Probably few people consistently follow only aggressive policies or only defensive policies. However, many investors probably tend more toward defensive-type policies in general.

**Liquidity and Marketability** Setting the proper degree of liquidity in a portfolio is largely a matter of judgment. It can be done by deciding to hold a certain number of dollars, say, \$20,000, in liquid assets; or to hold a certain percentage of assets, say, 10 percent, in liquid form; or some combination of the two. In asset allocation models, liquid assets (such as cash equivalents) often are stated as a percentage of the overall portfolio. The investment policy statement should also indicate what percentage of a portfolio may be in asset classes that generally lack marketability, such as real estate or other alternative investments.

**Diversification versus Concentration** As just stated, diversification is a defensive policy. The opposite of diversification is *concentration.* A portfolio may be concentrated in only one asset class (like common stocks or real estate) or even in just one or a few issues within an asset class. Sometimes events cause investment concentration—albeit unconsciously without its being a conscious policy. This may occur, for example, when a corporate executive's portfolio becomes overweighted in his or her company's stock. The problem then becomes how to diversify in an efficient manner.

#### **Possible Asset Classes to Be Considered**

Each investor needs to select those asset classes he or she feels might be suitable to include in his or her asset allocation decision making. The following are some possible asset classes:

- N Domestic common stocks
- N Foreign common stocks

- N Domestic bonds (investment grade)
- N Foreign bonds
- N High-yield (junk) bonds
- N Cash-type assets (cash equivalents)
- N Longer-term fixed-dollar (guaranteed principal) assets
- N Investment real estate
- N Other alternative investments
- N Convertible securities
- N Gold and precious metals
- N Other assets

## **Investment Vehicles to Be Considered**

These asset classes can be found in a number of different investment vehicles. Each of them needs to be considered in asset allocation planning because a person is exposed to an asset class no matter how it is held.

**Directly Owned Assets** These are assets owned by a person in his or her own name or jointly with another. They may be titled to the person or held in brokerage or other accounts in the person's name.

**Assets Held through Financial Intermediaries** Here the person owns shares or interests in a financial intermediary that owns and manages the investment assets. Mutual funds and REITs are common examples.

**Assets Held in Qualified Retirement Plans** Many employer-provided retirement plans are *defined contribution* or *individual account plans* where specific accounts are allocated to individual employees. Participating employees often have control over how these account balances are invested.

**IRAs** IRA owners can invest their account balances in a broad array of investment vehicles and annuities. However, they cannot be invested in life insurance policies or collectibles.

**Life Insurance Cash Values** Traditional fixed-dollar policies and universal life (UL) policies have fixed-dollar (portfolio product) cash values. They are guaranteed principal assets. On the other hand, the asset classifications of variable life (VL) and variable universal life (VUL) policies depend on the subaccounts into which their cash values are placed.

**Investment Annuity Cash Values** Traditional fixed-dollar annuities have fixed-dollar (portfolio product) cash values and thus are guaranteed principal assets. Variable annuities (VAs) have cash values that the annuity owner can elect to place in one or more subaccounts. The subaccounts chosen determine the asset class.

**Employee Stock Options and Stock Plans** Some employees have been granted stock options or are eligible for other stock plans (e.g., restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans, stock appreciation rights, and so forth). Such options and plans clearly represent an investment interest in the employer's stock, but they may be difficult to value. (These plans and their valuation are discussed in Chapter 18.)

For our present purposes, we shall value unexercised stock options by subtracting the exercise price at grant (option price) from the current market price of the stock and multiplying by the number of shares for which the option can be exercised. This is referred to as the *intrinsic value* of the option.

For example, assume that two years ago John Herrera was granted nonqualified stock options (NQSOs) with a duration of 10 years to purchase 1,000 shares of his employer's stock at a price of \$20 per share (grant price) and the market price of the stock is now \$45 per share. The options' present intrinsic value is \$25,000 (\$45 – \$20 = \$25 × 1,000 shares). Of course, if an option already has been exercised or stock has been acquired under some other plan, the stock is simply counted as directly owned common stock.

**Trust Assets** Some people are beneficiaries of trusts. This can involve many different arrangements. Some people have set up funded revocable living trusts. The assets in these trusts (which can be terminated or amended by the creator at any time) should be counted in the creator-beneficiary's asset allocation because for all practical purposes they are still owned by the creator-beneficiary. Other times, a person may be a beneficiary of an irrevocable trust established by someone else. These trust assets may or may not be counted for asset allocation purposes, depending on what kinds of rights the beneficiary has in the trust's property. This is a judgment call.

#### **How Investments (Asset Classes) Should Be Held (Location Analysis)**

The issue here is whether investments should be held directly or in taxadvantaged vehicles. This is also referred to as *location analysis*. How much planning can be done in this area depends largely on the circumstances. Some people have almost all their investable assets in tax-advantaged plans, so their choices are limited. Others have few tax-advantaged plans available to them. In a few cases, participants in tax-advantaged plans may have limited or no choice as to how their plan assets are to be invested. The tax-advantaged vehicles we are considering include qualified retirement plans, IRAs, variable annuity contracts, and variable life insurance policies, among others.

#### **Advantages of Directly Owned Assets**

- N Capital gains are not realized and recognized (taxable) until the asset is sold or exchanged in a taxable transaction.
- N Long-term capital gains are taxed at favorable rates.
- N Capital assets presently get a stepped-up income tax basis at death.
- N Planning can be done to postpone or even totally avoid capital gains taxation.
- N Capital losses can reduce or eliminate capital gains, and then any remaining losses can reduce ordinary income by up to \$3,000 per year. Unused capital losses can be carried forward.
- N Investors have control over the investment of their assets.

#### **Limitations of Directly Owned Assets**

- N Dividends and taxable interest are taxable each year as received. But, as of this writing, qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate.
- N In order to change investments or an asset allocation, it will be necessary to realize and recognize capital gains (and pay capital gains taxes) if appreciated assets are sold or exchanged.
- N Mutual funds and other investment companies may produce capital gains for shareholders through fund turnover.

#### **Advantages of Holding Assets in Tax-Advantaged Plans**

- N All investment income (dividends, taxable interest, and capital gains) is not taxed currently to the participant. Taxation (as ordinary income) is deferred until distributions are actually made from the plan. Distributions from Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k) plans are tax free.
- N Changes in investments or in asset allocation can be made tax free as long as they are made within the tax-favored plan. Thus, if assets have gains, these plans may be a good place to make changes in asset allocation. On the other hand, if assets have losses, directly owned assets may be the better ones to sell since the realized losses can offset other capital gains or up to \$3,000 per year of ordinary income.
- N Distributions usually can be deferred a long time, resulting in long periods of tax-deferred earnings. An example is the "stretch IRA" concept described in Chapter 16.

#### **Limitations of Holding Assets in Tax-Advantaged Plans**

N All investment income (dividends, taxable interest, and capital gains), as well as any taxable principal in these plans, will be taxed as ordinary income when distributed. [Roth IRAs, 401(k)s, and education IRAs are exceptions; their distributions are tax free.] Also, the balances in these plans must be distributed at some point (the minimum distribution rules are covered in Chapter 16).

- N There is no step-up in basis at death for investments in these plans, and lower capital gains rates do not apply even though investment returns in the plan may have come in the form of capital gains.
- N Participants must abide by the terms of the particular plan, and employers can change plan terms for the future.
- N There may be penalty taxes for taking premature distributions (10 percent penalty tax) or for failure to take required minimum distributions (50 percent penalty tax).

## **Some Observations Concerning Location Analysis**

While it can be seen from the preceding discussion that there are few hard and fast certainties in this area, the following are some general observations:

- N Tax-free municipal bonds should always be held directly since their interest is tax free.
- N Zero-coupon taxable bonds should be held in tax-advantaged accounts. Otherwise, their annual accrued interest will be taxed currently to the owners even though it has not yet been received in cash.
- N An argument can be made that growth-type common stocks (with low or no current dividends) that are intended to be held for the long term probably should be held directly. The investor then would get tax-deferred or tax-free compounding of hoped-for capital gains, lower capital gains tax rates (if sold or exchanged before death), and at present, a step-up in basis if held until death. (Investors also may engage in other techniques to delay or avoid capital gains taxation, as described in Chapter 11.)
- N An argument can be made that taxable bonds and guaranteed principal investments that pay current interest should be placed in tax-advantaged plans so that the tax on the current interest payments can be deferred.
- N If changes are to be made in investments or in asset allocation, and appreciated assets are involved, it is better to try to make them in tax-advantaged plans so no capital gains taxes will be incurred. On the other hand, if assets with investment losses are involved, it is better to sell directly owned assets so capital losses can be realized to offset any capital gains or up to \$3,000 per year of ordinary income.

## **Case Examples of Asset Allocation Strategies**

There can be wide differences of opinion concerning asset allocation strategies, even with a given factual situation. The two case situations given here are meant simply to illustrate general asset allocation techniques.

#### **A Young Professional Couple**

Let us assume that Harry and Susan Modern are married; both have careers outside the home; and they have two children, ages six and four. Harry, age 40, is a lawyer with his own practice (a sole proprietor). Susan, age 38, has an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering and an MBA. She is an executive with a large pharmaceutical company. They each earn approximately \$200,000 per year. Harry has recently established a retirement plan for the self-employed (an HR-10 plan), and Susan has a qualified pension plan and a qualified 401(k) plan (with five separate investment options including employer stock, among which she can select) from her employer.

Her employer's matching 401(k) contribution goes into the employer stock option. Half of her account balance is in her company's stock and half is in a diversified stock fund.

Harry carries \$500,000 face amount of life insurance on his life, with \$100,000 from a VUL policy (with an \$8,000 cash value in its common stock account) and \$400,000 as term insurance. Susan also carries \$500,000 face amount of life insurance on her life, with \$100,000 from a traditional fixed-premium whole life policy (with a \$2,000 cash value) and the remainder as group and individual term insurance.

Four years ago, Susan's employer granted her NQSOs to purchase 1,000 shares of the company's stock at an option price of \$50 per share. The market price of the stock is now \$90 per share. The NQSOs are vested, but Susan has not yet exercised them.

From an employee stock purchase plan at Susan's employer, a lump-sum distribution from Harry's former employer's profit-sharing plan when he left the firm, their personal savings, and a small inheritance from Harry's mother, they have accumulated other investable assets of \$300,000. They own their own home, valued at \$700,000, on which there is now (after refinancing) a \$500,000 fixed-rate mortgage with interest currently at 4.5 percent. As of now, they have decided not to use their investable assets to pay off the mortgage.

Susan and Harry file a joint income tax return and are in the 35 percent federal and 40 percent combined federal, state, and local top marginal income tax brackets. They also have indicated that they wish to plan their asset allocations on a combined basis, rather than individually.

With respect to their investment objectives and policies, the Moderns first plan to accumulate assets for their children's educations. For this purpose, they plan to set up Section 529 plans for each child. They then want to prepare for their own comfortable retirement at around age 60, and finally to establish a general investment fund. Since their oldest child is age six (with about 12 years before he begins college), all of these goals have a reasonably long time horizon. Both Harry and Susan believe in the longterm growth and superior returns of the stock market. Harry wants to put all their available assets in common stocks, but Susan is concerned about the volatility of the market. Both agree that current dividend income is not important to them. Harry eventually would like to invest in and manage sound income-producing real estate, which he says he comes across from time to time in his law practice. Susan agrees with this idea, but they both agree that investment real estate is for the future.

As of now, they both agree that they might consider the following asset classes for their portfolio:

- N Growth common stocks (including the stock of Susan's employer, Growth Drugs)
- N Value oriented common stocks (as a second choice to growth stocks)
- N Investment-grade corporate bonds (if held in tax-advantaged plans or accounts)
- N Investment-grade municipal bonds (held directly)
- N Guaranteed principal assets (if held in tax-advantaged plans or accounts)
- N Cash equivalents (liquid assets)
- N Investment real estate (for the future)

Considering the long-term return-risk estimates suggested to them by their investment adviser, and their own situation and opinions, Harry and Susan have decided that for now they would like to plan for the following percentage allocations:

| Growth and value common stocks                    |            |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------|
| (with mostly growth stocks)                       | 70 percent |
| Corporate bonds (held in tax-advantaged accounts) | 15 percent |
| Guaranteed principal assets (held in              |            |
| tax-advantaged accounts)                          | 10 percent |
| Cash equivalents                                  | 5 percent  |

They also prefer not to have more than 10 percent of their portfolios in any one stock or security.

The Moderns presently have an overall investment portfolio of about \$460,000. Almost all of this is in growth (or diversified) common stocks, as follows: \$40,000 account balance under Harry's HR-10 plan; \$70,000 account balance under Susan's Section 401(k) plan; \$8,000 cash value of Harry's VUL policy; the \$40,000 intrinsic value of Susan's stock options (\$90 – \$50 = \$40 × 1,000 shares = \$40,000); and almost all of their \$300,000 of directly owned assets (which include \$95,000 of Growth Drug stock purchased under Susan's employee stock purchase plan), growth-type stock mutual funds, and other growth-oriented common stocks. Only the \$2,000 cash value of Susan's traditional whole life policy is otherwise invested.

However, according to their asset allocation goals, they should have approximately \$322,000 in growth (or perhaps value) common stocks, \$69,000 in bonds, \$46,000 in guaranteed principal assets, and \$23,000 in cash equivalents. Furthermore, they have a concentration problem with respect to Susan's Growth Drug stock. They now have \$170,000 in Growth Drug stock—\$35,000 under Susan's 401(k) plan, \$95,000 held directly, and the \$40,000 value of her stock options—which is almost 37 percent of their portfolio.

To implement their desired asset allocation strategy, Harry and Susan should add bonds, guaranteed principal assets, and cash equivalents to their portfolio. Correspondingly, they should reduce their stock holdings, particularly in Growth Drug. Naturally, they want to incur as little in the way of capital gains taxes as possible. With these thoughts in mind, the following actions might be suggested to the Moderns:

- N Harry might change the investments in his HR-10 plan and VUL policy from stocks to investment-grade corporate bonds or bond funds. This would not result in current taxation.
- N Susan might change the allocation of her contributions to her 401(k) plan from stocks (particularly Growth Drug stock) to the plan's stable value fund.
- N She might also change her present account balance to the plan's stable value fund or corporate bond account. Note that under PPA of 2006 (as explained in Chapter 13), she can do this with respect to employer stock in the plan both from her contributions and from the employer match (since she has been with the company more than three years). Again, this would not result in current taxation.
- N When Susan exercises her NQSOs, she might use presently owned Growth Drug stock as part of the purchase price (to the extent permitted by the plan). Or she might sell part or all of the stock received after exercise so no capital gains will be realized. These actions will reduce her exposure to Growth Drug stock with lessened taxation. (See Chapter 11.)
- N When Susan and Harry have savings, proceeds from sales of securities, or other funds available for investment, they might first place the funds in a tax-free money market account (cash equivalent) until it reaches the desired level and then acquire directly held investment-grade municipal bonds until the overall bond portion reaches the desired level.

- N If Harry and Susan are making charitable gifts, they might consider giving the most appreciated Growth Drug stock instead of cash. This will help reduce their investment exposure to Growth Drug stock. (See Chapter 11.)
- N Finally, Susan and Harry may have to just bite the bullet and sell some appreciated stock and pay any capital gains taxes due. They probably do not have enough assets and possibly are too early in their lifecycle to consider more sophisticated techniques for deferring capital gains, as discussed in Chapter 11.

#### **A More Mature Retired Couple**

Now let us consider an entirely different case. Assume that John and Martha Senior are married, their three children are out of their home and selfsupporting, and John and Martha are retired. John is age 67 and Martha is 64. John receives Social Security retirement benefits and a pension for his and Martha's lifetimes (with a 50 percent survivor's benefit for Martha if he should predecease her) from his former employer. Martha has not yet begun to receive Social Security retirement benefits, but she will begin to do so when she reaches full benefit retirement age. Martha receives a small pension of her own and is the income beneficiary for her lifetime of a modest trust established for her under her mother's will. John is covered by Medicare, and Martha presently has COBRA continuation coverage under John's former employer's medical plan. Martha will be eligible for Medicare when she reaches age 65. John carries \$200,000 face amount of traditional whole life insurance that has a cash value of \$40,000.

At John's retirement, he rolled over all of his account balance under his former employer's qualified savings plan into a regular rollover IRA. He now has \$300,000 in this rollover IRA, with \$200,000 invested in two-year insured CDs and \$100,000 in investment-grade corporate bonds. From their personal savings, John and Martha have another \$200,000 in directly owned assets, of which \$100,000 is in three-year insured CDs and \$100,000 is in a diversified common stock mutual fund.

Regarding investment objectives and policies, Martha and John would like to preserve their capital as much as possible, receive reasonable current income with moderate capital growth, protect their investment income against declines in interest rates as much as possible, maintain reasonable liquidity, and have reasonable diversification. They do need a reasonable income from their investment portfolio to maintain a comfortable standard of living. They do not wish to consider the corpus of Martha's trust in their asset allocation planning.

#### **224 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

The Seniors file a joint income tax return and are in the 28 percent federal and 32 percent combined federal, state, and local top marginal income tax brackets. They want to consider their asset allocation decisions together.

For now, John and Martha agree that they would consider the following asset classes for their portfolio:

- N Diversified income-producing common stocks or stock funds
- N Investment-grade corporate bonds
- N U.S. Treasury bonds
- N Guaranteed principal assets
- N Cash equivalents (liquid assets)

Considering the return-risk estimates provided by their investment adviser and their own situation and opinions, the Seniors have decided that they would like to plan for the following percentage allocation of their portfolios:

| Investment grade corporate bonds (5- to                 |            |
|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 15-year maturities)                                     | 25 percent |
| U.S. Treasury bonds (20- to 30-year maturities)         | 25 percent |
| CDs (2- to 3-year maturities)                           | 20 percent |
| Diversified income-producing common stocks              | 20 percent |
| Other guaranteed principal assets (e.g., life insurance |            |
| cash values)                                            | 5 percent  |
| Cash equivalents                                        | 5 percent  |

In this allocation, they are planning to ladder their bond and other fixedincome portfolio to protect themselves against call and reinvestment risks, as well as against interest rate risk to bond values. Hence, they plan to have about 25 percent of their assets in shorter-term securities (cash equivalents and 2- to 3-year CDs), 25 percent in intermediate-term bonds (5- to 15-year corporate bonds), and 25 percent in long-term bonds (20- to 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds). Their bonds could be held directly (outright or through mutual funds) or in the IRA.

To implement their desired asset allocation strategy, Martha and John need to move some of their assets now in CDs to U.S. Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and a money market account in the appropriate amounts. These assets can be held directly or in the IRA. These shifts probably can occur as the CDs mature, so no early withdrawal penalties need to be paid. There also should be no tax consequences.

John has more cash value in his traditional whole life policy than he would like (5 percent of their \$540,000 portfolio equals \$27,000). He has indicated that he wants to keep the insurance in force to protect Martha against a reduction in retirement income if he should predecease her. Generally, one tries not to take taxable amounts from life insurance contracts. With these factors in mind, John has several options with respect to this policy. They are discussed more fully in Chapters 21 and 29.

Finally, John and Martha already have about the desired amount of common stocks. These could be held outright or through mutual funds.

## **Financial Management**

In addition to asset allocation in investment planning, most people need to develop financial strategies for managing their cash flow and expenditures (budgeting), to facilitate saving, and to meet their financing needs (debt management). In addition, during their retirement years some people may need to consider reverse mortgages as a way to supplement their retirement income.

#### **Cash Flow Management and Budgeting**

A primary tool of cash flow management is the *personal or family budget*. This is a listing of expected cash flows to be received and expected expenditures in a given period of time, often monthly.

Such cash flows and expenditures were listed in the discussion of the personal cash flow (income) statement in Chapter 1. Some cash flow and expenditure items do not fit neatly into a monthly pattern (such as bonuses and semiannual or quarterly investment returns on the cash flow side and semiannual real estate taxes, quarterly federal and state estimated income tax payments, tuition bills, and perhaps some insurance premiums on the expenditure side). Such larger, irregular items can be prorated on a monthly basis for planning purposes or planned for separately.

Budgeting allows the person or family to keep their expenditures within their expected cash flow. The difference between cash flow and expenditures is net saving. It is desirable to have positive net savings. Obviously, allowing expenditures to exceed cash flow for a sustained period (i.e., living beyond one's means) is very bad financial management. Unfortunately, this simple truth is lost on some people who clearly need professional help in this regard. For some recent years, the savings rate in the United States has been very low or even negative.

Another aspect of cash flow management is *emergency fund planning*. This was discussed previously in Chapter 1.

#### **Savings Strategies**

As a general principle, saving is much better than debt as a financial policy. The economic situation as of this writing is a good illustration of this point. Of course, for many people it is easier to spend than to save. However, there are a number of strategies that can aid in saving, such as:

N Follow a "pay yourself first" strategy. This means that each month or other period a person or couple makes at least a minimum payment to their savings before any other payments or expenditures.

This really is part of the budgeting process. If necessary, this minimum saving can be reduced for a month or so, but there is always some saving. This creates the habit of thrift. Benjamin Franklin famously argues for this habit in his autobiography.

- N Take full advantage of benefit plans requiring automatic employee contributions if they are otherwise favorable. Contributions to such plans are made through payroll deductions. The prime example would be IRC Section 401(k) plans discussed in Chapter 13. In many cases, employers also provide matching contributions to such plans. Employers now can require automatic employee enrollment in such plans unless employees affirmatively elect not to enroll. It has been reported that automatic enrollment substantially increases employee participation in such plans and hence automatic retirement savings through them. Of course, employees can, and probably should, contribute more than the automatic minimum contributions.
- N Make allowable contributions to individual tax-advantaged plans, such as traditional and Roth IRAs.
- N Repay debt in an organized fashion such as through amortizing first mortgages and home equity loans where an increasing portion of each payment goes to reduce the loan principal. Paying off debt is a form of saving.
- N One of the arguments advanced in favor of fixed-premium whole life insurance is that the policyowner tends to view the fixed premium as a periodic financial obligation and thus pays it. This keeps the policy in force and causes the cash value to grow year by year. This has been described as a form of semicompulsory saving. Of course, any increase in life insurance or individual annuity cash values is a form of saving.
- N As a lifetime giving strategy for estate planning purposes, parents, grandparents, or others may consider making gifts to their children, grandchildren, or others to enable them to start their own tax-advantaged plans, like IRAs, if they are eligible. This will enable the donees to start these plans early and help instill in them the habit of thrift. People also may give or lend children, grandchildren, or other family members part or all of the down payment on their first home. The donees then will have more equity in their homes and can pay off their amortizing mortgages.

#### **Financing Strategies**

People may want or need to borrow for a number of valid reasons. Most people need to borrow to finance the purchase of a primary residence or a secondary residence. Many people may borrow to finance other large purchases, such as automobiles or vacations. Many others must take loans to finance their children's educations, although now there are attractive ways to prefinance education costs. (Read more on education planning in Chapter 12.) Sometimes people unfortunately need to borrow to meet emergencies, such as for extraordinary medical costs or expenditures during temporary unemployment. However, meeting the costs of such emergencies is one reason to maintain an adequate *emergency fund* as explained in Chapter 1.

An entirely different reason for taking loans is to finance an investment position or start or maintain a closely held business. Borrowing to carry an investment position that is larger than investors otherwise could have with their own funds (financial leverage) will magnify investment gains, but also magnify investment losses. It is a risky investment strategy. In some areas, like real estate investing, it is common to use financial leverage as noted in Chapter 6. Many small businesses find they must borrow to provide capital for their businesses.

**Long-Term versus Short-Term Debt** As it's name implies, *short-term debt*  is due within, say, three years. The borrower needs to prepare to be able to pay off debt within a relatively short period. In the case of credit card debt, for example, the carrying charges become very high if the card balance is not paid within about 25 days.

Another category is *intermediate-term debt* with a maturity between shortterm and long-term debt.

*Long-term debt* might be thought of as debt that must be repaid in more than 10 years. In many cases, such debts (for example, mortgage loans) are amortizing. That is, they are paid off through level monthly payments which consist partly of principal repayment and partly of interest on the remaining loan balance. Thus, the interest portion of each level payment constitutes most of the payment in the beginning but diminishes as the loan is paid off. The reverse is true of the principal portion. Of course, long-term debt normally is used for long-term commitments, such as the purchase of a home.

**Secured versus Unsecured Debt** Assets of the debtor are pledged as collateral to protect the creditor in the case of secured debt.

Mortgages and margin loans are examples of secured debt. Sometimes the security behind secured loans is subsidiary or behind that of other secured loans, such as second mortgages, for example. Home equity loans and lines are second mortgages on residences.

A secured creditor can levy against or sell the pledged asset for payment if the debtor defaults on the loan. If the secured loan is *recourse indebtedness*, the creditor also can recover any unpaid amounts from the debtor's other assets (i.e., can go against the debtor personally) as well as from the pledged asset. On the other hand, nonrecourse indebtedness does not allow the creditor to go against the debtor personally, but only against the pledged property. Residential mortgages normally are recourse indebtedness.

For *unsecured debt*, the creditor only relies on the debtor's personal ability to repay the loan (the full faith and credit of the borrower). No property is pledged as security. Unsecured debt involves more credit risk than recourse secured debt, assuming the same credit circumstances of the borrowers.

**Types of Debt** There is a wide variety of kinds of debt persons can incur.

*Mortgage Debt:* Most people incur mortgage debt to finance the purchase of their primary residence and perhaps a secondary residence. Real estate investors typically finance their investments with a mortgage as discussed in Chapter 6.

There are several types of mortgage indebtedness on residences, including:

- N *Fixed-rate mortgages*. These are amortizing longer-term loans whose interest rate remains fixed (level) for the duration of the loan. Thus, they protect the borrower against increases in interest rates. On the other hand, if interest rates decline, these mortgages can be refinanced at the prevailing lower rates. Thus, the interest rates on these fixed-rate mortgages normally are higher than for the comparable adjustable-rate mortgages described next.
- N *Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)*. These are amortizing longer-term loans where the interest rates are indexed or tied to some market-based interest rate, such as LIBOR or the yield on certain U.S. Treasury securities. The rate then will be the benchmark rate plus, say, 1 or 2 percentage points. Thus the interest rate on these loans will "adjust" to the indexed market rates. If the indexed market rates decline, this will benefit the borrower. If they go up, the reverse will be true. However, if the indexed rates go up, the borrower *may* be able to refinance the loan with a fixed-rate mortgage. The danger in relying on this strategy is that if home prices decline (so the borrower does not have enough, or any, equity in the home) or credit conditions worsen, the borrower may not be able to refinance and will be stuck with a rising interest rate. This will be particularly true if the adjustable-rate loan had a below market (unusually low) "teaser" interest rate in the beginning which in a few years converted to a higher adjusted rate.

As of this writing, many homeowners with such adjustable-rate mortgages have been unable to refinance into fixed-rate loans when interest rates rose because the prices of their homes had declined to below the amounts of the mortgage (i.e., were "under water"), and so the homeowners had no equity in their residences.

It is also possible that if interest rates rise substantially, the monthly mortgage payments on the ARM will not be able to cover the increased interest, and so the principal balance of the loan will actually increase rather than decrease as is normally true for amortizing mortgages.

ARMs may also have limits on the increase in the loan's interest rate over a one-year period and for the life of the loan. These limits are called interest rate caps.

- N *Hybrid ARMs*. This is a combination of the previous two types. There is a fixed rate for a period of time and then the loan becomes an ARM.
- N *Home equity loans*. These are second mortgages because they are an additional lien on the residence (after the first mortgage) and are separate from the first mortgage. They are generally fixed-rate amortizing loans.
- N *Home equity lines of credit*. In this case, the lender makes available an amount (a line of credit) that can be drawn down (borrowed) by the borrower. The monthly charge is the adjustable interest rate on the loan balance. The borrower can also pay off part or all of the loan balance as he or she wishes. These are also second mortgages on the residence.

*Prepayment of Mortgage Loans:* Borrowers may prepay the principal on mortgage loans before they are due. Frequently this can be done without any payment penalty. This may be done gradually to pay off the loan balance sooner than otherwise would be the case, like doubling up on monthly payments when there are funds to do so (i.e., making extra payments). This may be an effective saving strategy for some families.

For amortizing mortgages, prepayment results in a reduced number of payments with the monthly payment amount unchanged. For home equity lines, payment over and above the current monthly interest due reduces the outstanding loan balance.

Prepayment reduces further interest costs. Therefore, it should be evaluated in terms of the after-tax investment returns otherwise expected to be available from the funds that will be used for prepayments.

*Refinancing of Mortgage Loans:* As was noted previously, refinancing of mortgage loans may be a viable strategy when interest rates decline. One fixed-rate mortgage may be paid off and refinanced with another fixed-rate mortgage carrying a lower interest rate. Just as a rule of thumb, some commentators suggest that such refinancing may be worthwhile when current

#### **230 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

interest rates are 1 percent or more lower than the existing fixed rate. An analysis of this would involve comparing the yearly after-tax savings as compared with the time estimated for the after-tax savings to recover any closing costs for the refinancing.

Also, as discussed previously, an ARM may be refinanced with a fixed-rate loan and vice versa.

*Margin Loans:* These are loans from brokers and banks using eligible securities as collateral. The interest rate normally is indexed to a benchmark market rate (like the prime rate) plus several percentage points. The terms can vary considerably among brokers. Margin loans may be used for general credit purposes (because their interest rates may be relatively low), but they are generally used to finance additional purchases of securities (i.e., to leverage an investment position). This use of margin loans is more risky and is an aggressive investment strategy. Margin loans were discussed in Chapter 4.

*Life Insurance Policy Loans:* Cash-value life insurance policies offer policy-owners the right to borrow from the insurer an amount up to the cash value. Interest rates on policy loans normally are relatively low and the policy stipulates the amount of the rate or how it is determined. Life insurance policy loans are further described in Chapter 21.

*Retirement Plan Loans:* It is noted in Chapter 13 that qualified retirement plans, such as 401 (k) plans and profit-sharing plans, may permit participants to borrow a portion of their account balances. Such plan loans must carry a "reasonable" interest rate and be repayable under certain conditions as specified in ERISA. They represent an exception to the prohibited transaction rules or ERISA and are described in more detail in Chapter 13.

Participants may be tempted to borrow from their qualified plans because the money is available and the interest rate charged by the plan, while "reasonable," may be relatively low. Also the amount borrowed continues to earn an investment return inside the plan.

However, care must be taken with respect to such loans because if they are not repaid when due, they are considered distributions from the plan and are taxed as ordinary income to the participant with perhaps an additional 10 percent penalty tax if they are premature distributions. Also, if they are not repaid, they deplete the participant's funds in retirement.

*Credit Card Debt:* Many people have one or more credit cards. Some use these cards as a convenient way to budget their expenses for the month but are careful to pay off the card balance when due at the end of the month before any finance charges are due. This is a logical budgeting strategy.

On the other hand, if card payments are not paid immediately when due, normally very high finance charges will be charged often for several months. When this happens, credit card debt is very expensive, and many commentators, including your authors, suggest it should be avoided.

*Other Debt:* There are a variety of other sources for borrowing, such as unsecured bank loans, loans and mortgages from credit unions (often at relatively low rates), education loans (again perhaps at low rates, depending on the program involved as discussed in Chapter 12), auto loans, and other secured debt, among others.

*Intra-Family Loans:* These may simply result from family members and friends providing needed credit to someone who needs it. It may be an act of family loyalty or friendship.

On the other hand, such loans may be part of tax-effective intra-family wealth transfer techniques as described in Chapter 27. In this case, as described in Chapter 3, such loans should carry at least the applicable federal rate (AFR) to avoid gift and income tax consequences.

#### **Reverse Mortgages for Retirement Income**

**Basic Characteristics** A relatively new financing approach is to take a mortgage on the person's or couple's residence that makes a single lump-sum payment, a series of monthly cash advances for the borrower's lifetime, a credit line that lets the borrower draw on the account balance as he or she wishes, or some combination of the these payment methods to the borrower. The borrower does not make any monthly payments on the mortgage. The loan also does not need to be repaid until the last surviving borrower dies, the home is sold, all borrowers permanently move to a new principal residence, the last surviving borrower fails to live in the home for 12 months due to physical or mental illness, or in certain other circumstances. Basically, the loan is not due until the last borrower leaves the home. Thus, there is no fixed due date for the mortgage. Interest is charged in the outstanding balance of the reverse mortgage and is added to this balance. Therefore, the amount owed (principal balance) will increase over the life of the mortgage and the borrower's equity in the home will probably decline. It can be seen that in all these respects it operates in a reverse fashion to conventional amortizing mortgages.

Reverse mortgages are *nonrecourse loans* in that they are paid when due solely from the proceeds from the sale of the home. If these proceeds are less than the loan balance, the borrower or his or her estate is not responsible for paying the shortfall. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) covers this loss for loans provided under the federal insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. Private lenders must absorb it for proprietary private sector plans. On the other hand, if the sale proceeds are more than the reverse mortgage balance, the difference belongs to the borrower or his or her estate (and thus heirs).

**Sources of Reverse Mortgages** Reverse mortgages are available from several sources. Most are originated through private lenders under the federal HECM program and are the only reverse mortgages insured by the FHA. This insurance covers the lenders for losses on sale of the homes and also covers the borrowers against loss because of default by lenders in making mortgage payments. For this insurance, borrowers are charged an upfront premium of 2 percent of the loan. The adjustable interest rate or HECMs loans is set monthly by the government and is the same for all HECMs lenders. These rates tend to be lower than for private home equity loans. However, origination fees and servicing fees vary among lenders, and so a potential borrower might want to check this with several lenders. A listing of HECM lenders for each state can be found on the HUD Web site: www .hud.gov/11/code/11plcrit.html.

Private lenders also provide *proprietary reverse mortgages* that are not insured by the government. These typically are for larger loans on more valuable properties than would be available under the HECM program. The terms and underwriting for these loans are determined by the private lenders. The Web site for the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA) is www.reversemortgages.org.

There also are *single-purpose reverse mortgages* offered by some state and local governments. The mortgages discussed previously can be used by the borrower for any purpose, but these are for special purposes like paying property taxes or making home repairs. Also, eligibility is limited for these loans where they are offered.

**Eligibility Requirements, Amounts, and Costs** The eligibility requirements for HECM mortgages include:

- N The borrower and other current owners of the home must be age 62 or over and live in the home as a principal residence.
- N The home must be a single family residence in a one- to four-unit dwelling, a condominium, or part of a planned unit development.
- N The residence must meet minimum property standards.
- N The borrower must discuss the program with a counselor from a HUDapproved agency.

The maximum amounts of HECM loans is set by the FHA and is based on:

- N The value and location of the home (the borrower's income and personal credit rating are not considered because the home is the entire security for the mortgage).
- N The maximum amount depends on median home values in the county involved.
- N The age or ages of the borrower(s).

As noted previously, proprietary loans can be made for larger amounts than HECM loans.

The costs for HECM loans include initial charges, such as origination fees (which are limited by law to 2 percent of the loan up to \$200,000 and 1 percent over that with a \$6,000 overall limit); cost of property appraisals, title search, and so forth; and the 2 percent mortgage insurance premium. Except for the insurance premium, these costs vary among lenders, so comparisons may be in order. Again, except for the mortgage insurance premium, these are the initial costs normally associated with originating a mortgage loan. The interest rate charged on HECM loans has already been discussed.

**Planning Issues** Reverse mortgages are a relatively new concept and are somewhat controversial. They are basically a way for people at or close to retirement age to tap the equity in their homes (which by that time may be debt free or with relatively low mortgages) so as to provide a retirement income they cannot outlive, in the case of monthly cash advances, a lump sum to use for any purpose in the case of a single-sum payment, or a credit line to draw on as needed for that payment form, and still remain in their homes for as long as they live or until they wish or need to move. For federally insured reverse mortgages, there is no credit financial risk for either the lender or the borrower. If the lifetime monthly cash advance payment form is selected, the borrower has no mortality risk because the advances will continue as long as the borrower lives, but if he or she dies earlier than expected, the balance of the home's value will go to the borrower's estate and heirs. No depletion of the retiree's financial resources (stocks, bonds, etc.) is required to produce the life income. The payments from a reverse mortgage also are income tax– free because they are loans which are not considered gross income for federal income tax purposes.

The main argument against reverse mortgages is the relatively high initial cost of originating the mortgage which typically is added to the loan balance. Of course, heirs (and perhaps the retiree as well) may object because the heirs' inheritance will be gradually depleted.

Other strategies for dealing with a retiree's primary residence would be to sell the residence and perhaps buy a smaller home, possibly in another part of the country, or rent living quarters. In some cases, retirees may want or need to move into assisted-living facilities. In such cases, and possibly others, reverse mortgages would not be appropriate. Another possibility would be for the retiree simply to take a conventional home equity line of credit and borrow against it as needed. However, there is no assurance that such a line would last the borrower's lifetime.

Because of the guaranteed life income feature, reverse mortgages are analogous to other financial arrangements designed to produce such income. These include immediate life annuities sold by life insurance companies (covered in Chapter 17) and charitable gift annuities provided by many charitable organizations (discussed in Chapter 19). In these cases, the life annuities are guaranteed by the insurance company or the charity, respectively. However, both of these arrangements have mortality risk when the annuitant or annuitants die because the principal paid for the annuity is liquidated at death. Charitable remainder trusts (CRTs) also provide retirement income (as described in Chapter 19), but this income is not guaranteed except by the assets inside the CRT.

In all these situations, planning might include a strategy for replacing lost inheritances for heirs. This might be done, for example, through an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) as covered in Chapter 29. Such an ILIT can be arranged so as not to be included in the retiree's gross estate for federal tax purposes, while the vehicle providing lifetime retirement income will actually deplete the gross estate for tax purposes.

It can be suggested that reverse mortgages, when appropriate, can be used in combination with other arrangements, like immediate life annuities or charitable gift annuities. Reverse mortgages can supplement them. On the other hand, reverse mortgages can be viewed as a reserve or contingent source of retirement income in case of economic downturn or other shortages of retirement income in the future.
