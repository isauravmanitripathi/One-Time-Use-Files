Employee stock options and other stock plans have been used for many years, and the tax law has had various provisions concerning them.1 But for most of this time, stock options were granted only, or mainly, to senior executives. However, in recent years, some corporations have adopted more

<sup>1</sup>At various times, tax-favored stock options were called *restricted stock options* and *qualified stock options.* These particular plans have been discontinued. The present tax-favored stock option is called an ISO.

broadly based plans covering more levels of management, or even most of their full-time employees. Of course, many companies also have employee stock purchase plans that are designed to cover virtually all employees.

## **Types of Plans**

In the classification that follows, we have divided employer stock plans into *statutory plans* and *nonstatutory plans.* Statutory plans are those to which the tax law accords special tax advantages but which also must meet certain requirements to be eligible for the advantages. On the other hand, nonstatutory plans are not based on any special tax provisions, but rather, are governed by general tax principles.

### **Statutory Plans**

**Incentive Stock Options** These options were created by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) in Section 422 of the IRC. They can be made available at the employer's discretion to only some employees, normally certain highly compensated executives, and hence, can be discriminatory in nature.

*Requirements for ISOs:* A number of requirements must be met before a plan can qualify as an ISO plan. For example, the term of an option cannot exceed 10 years; the option price must equal or exceed the value of the stock when the option was granted; no disposition can be made of the stock by the person within 2 years from granting the option and within 1 year of the transfer of the stock to him or her (i.e., after exercise of the option); the option must be nontransferable (except by will or inheritance at death); and the maximum value of stock for which an employee can exercise ISOs for the first time in a calendar year generally cannot exceed \$100,000 (valued as of the date of grant).

*Tax Treatment to Employees:* The main tax advantage of ISOs is that there is no regular income tax levied at the grant or at the exercise of the option by the employee. However, as noted in Chapter 10, the bargain element upon exercise of an ISO (i.e., the difference between the fair market value of the stock at exercise and the option price) is an adjustment item for individual AMT purposes. Aside from this AMT issue, the employee is taxed only when he or she sells the stock purchased under the option plan, and then any gain realized is taxed as a capital gain. The capital gain would be the difference between the option price (the income tax basis of the stock) and the stock's fair market value on the date of sale.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume that in 2003, Laura Johnson was granted an ISO to purchase 1,000 shares of her employer's (Acme Corporation) common stock at an option price (*strike price*) of \$20 per share, which was its fair market value at the time. The ISO's term was 10 years. Laura had no gross income for federal income tax purposes at the grant of this option. Assume further that in 2007 Laura exercised the option with cash and purchased 1,000 shares of Acme common from her employer for \$20,000 (1,000 shares × \$20 per share = \$20,000). At that time (2007), the stock's fair market value was \$50 per share and the bargain element was \$30,000 (\$50 – \$20 = \$30 × 1,000 shares = \$30,000). Laura had no regular gross income at exercise of the ISO, but she did have an AMT adjustment item of \$30,000. Note, however, that if this adjustment item produces an AMT, the AMT may be recouped in future years because of the minimum tax credit (MTC) described in Chapter 10. Laura's regular income tax basis for the 1,000 shares is her cost (purchase price) of \$20,000, or \$20 per share.

Now assume that in 2009 Laura sells the 1,000 shares for \$80 per share. At this point, Laura realizes long-term capital gain of \$60 per share, or \$60,000 (\$80 – \$20 = \$60 per share × 1,000 shares = \$60,000).2 Furthermore, if Laura does not sell during her lifetime but holds the Acme stock until her death, it would get a stepped-up income tax basis and the gain to that point would never be taxed.

*Tax Treatment for the Employer:* The general principle is that an employer gets a corporate income tax deduction for compensation expenses at the same time and in the same amount as the employee realizes gross compensation income from the stock plan. In the case of an ISO, an employee never realizes compensation income, and so the employer never gets a corporate tax deduction.

#### **Employee Stock Purchase Plans**

*Basic Characteristics:* These are option arrangements under which all full-time employees meeting certain eligibility requirements are allowed to

<sup>2</sup>Note that in this example the holding requirements for an ISO have been met (i.e., two years from grant and one year from exercise). However, if the requirements for an ISO had been violated, the option would be treated as a nonqualified stock option (NQSO), described later in this chapter.

buy stock in their employer corporation, usually at a discount. The option price cannot be less than the lower of 85 percent of the stock's fair market value when the option was granted or 85 percent of the stock's fair market value when the option was exercised. Many employers use these maximum discounts as the option (strike) prices under their plans.

Employees who participate agree to have an estimated amount withheld from their pay to provide the funds with which to exercise their options at the end of an option period. If an employee decides not to exercise an option, the plan will return the amounts withheld to the employee, usually with interest.

Employee stock purchase plans are nondiscriminatory in that they cannot favor the highly paid executives of a corporation. In fact, no employee who owns 5 percent or more of the stock of a corporation can be granted such an option, and the maximum annual value of stock subject to these plans (determined as of the grant of the option) is \$25,000.

*Tax Treatment to Employees:* If the requirements of Section 423 of the IRC are met, there is no gross income for participating employees at the grant or exercise of options under employee stock purchase plans. However, to get this favorable tax treatment, no disposition can be made of the stock by the employee within two years from grant of the option and within one year from its exercise. If such a disqualifying disposition were to occur, the employee would be taxed as ordinary compensation income in the year of disposition on the difference between the fair market value of the stock and the option strike price when the option was exercised.

For dispositions (sales) of the stock after the two-year and one-year holding periods (or upon death, whenever occurring), when the option price was between 85 percent and 100 percent of the stock's fair market value at grant, the employee (or his or her estate) will be taxed as ordinary compensation income on the lesser of the difference between the fair market value of the stock and the option price at the time of disposition or death, or the difference between the fair market value of the stock and the option price as of the time the option was granted. The remainder of any gain at sale during the employee's lifetime would be capital gain. At the employee's death, his or her estate or heirs currently would get a stepped-up basis for the remainder of any gain and it would never be taxed.

Many corporations have adopted employee stock purchase plans. While a company's plan may not necessarily be as liberal as permitted by the tax law, a great many are. Therefore, eligible employees normally would be well advised to participate in these plans if they are at all financially able to do so. If an employee really does not want to hold the stock, he or she can simply sell it at a profit (assuming the stock price was such that the employee should have exercised the option in the first place).

*Tax Treatment for the Employer:* The employer does not get a corporate income tax deduction at grant or exercise of options under employee stock purchase plans.

**Qualified Retirement Plans Invested in Employer Securities** These plans were discussed in Chapters 13 and 14. Stock bonus plans permit investment in employer stock and allow distribution of that stock to participants. ESOPs must invest primarily in employer stock. Qualified savings plans with Section 401(k) options often allow significant portions of employee account balances to be invested in employer stock. The planning issue of possible lump-sum distributions of employer securities was explored in Chapter 16.

## **Nonstatutory Plans**

#### **General Tax Law Principles Governing Stock Compensation Plans**

**General Provisions** Since there are no special provisions governing these plans, they are interpreted under provisions of the code related to income— Section 61 in general and Section 83 in particular. Section 61 is simply the all-inclusive definition of gross income for federal income tax purposes. The more significant provision is Section 83, which deals with taxation of property transferred in connection with the performance of services.

Section 83, in essence, provides that the fair market value of property (minus any amount paid for the property) transferred to a person for the performance of services shall be included in that person's gross income in the first taxable year in which the person's rights in the property become transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever is applicable. A substantial risk of forfeiture might exist, for example, if an employee has to remain with the employer for a certain number of years to receive unfettered ownership or rights to the property. In effect, the property (minus any amount paid for it) is taxable to the person rendering the services as soon as all substantial conditions on his or her having it are removed.

**Section 83(b) Election** However, an important subsection, Section 83(b), provides that a person performing services (e.g., an employee) may elect within 30 days of a transfer to include the fair market value of the transferred property (minus any amount paid for the property) in his or her gross income, even though the property then was subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or was not transferable and hence, under Section 83, normally would not have been taxable at that point. This is called a *Section 83(b) election.* It can be an important planning tool.

However, if one makes a Section 83(b) election, and the value of transferred property is included in the person's gross income, but the property subsequently is forfeited (because, say, the employee did not remain with the employer for the required period), no tax deduction is allowed for the forfeiture. The election also cannot be revoked without the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. On the other hand, when the substantial risk of forfeiture expires, there is no tax. Normally, of course, one does not want to pay taxes any sooner than necessary.

On the other hand, a person receiving property for the performance of services (e.g., an executive receiving restricted employer stock) might want to make a Section 83(b) election and be taxed on the current value of the stock if the current value is relatively low, the person expects it to rise significantly in the future, and he or she expects to remain with the employer at least through the forfeiture period. These, of course, may be big "ifs." Much depends on the circumstances. But if the stock price currently is low and is expected to do well (as in some start-up situations, for example), the only real risk the person would seem to be taking is the possible loss of his or her current tax payment.

If an employee makes a Section 83(b) election and is currently taxed, the employer gets a corporate income tax deduction for compensation paid in the amount taxable to the employee. The effects of a Section 83(b) election will be illustrated later in connection with the discussion of restricted stock.

#### **Current Stock Bonus**

Some employers pay part of employees' current compensation in unrestricted stock. In this case, the employees receive current compensation equal to the fair market value of the stock. On the other hand, employers often pay part of a current bonus in cash and part in restricted stock (i.e., subject to the condition that the employee stays with the employer for a minimum period). In this case, the rules for restricted stock apply.

#### **Nonqualified Stock Options (NQSOs)**

**Basic Characteristics** These are stock options that do not meet the requirements for ISOs and so are taxed on the basis of the general principles just discussed. Correspondingly, NQSOs can have terms decided upon by the parties and are not limited in the amount of stock subject to such options exercisable by an employee in any one year (as are ISOs). Hence, NQSOs can be considerably more flexible for employers and employees. Like ISOs, they can be granted only to certain employees, and hence, may be discriminatory. NQSOs generally have become more popular than ISOs as a compensation technique. While there are no statutory requirements to do so, NQSOs are often granted with an option price equal to 100 percent of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and for option terms of around 10 years.

**Tax Treatment to Employees** There normally is no taxable event (gross income) at grant because the tax regulations view their value then as not being readily ascertainable.3 On the other hand, upon exercise of an option (and transfer of the stock to the employee), the employee will receive ordinary compensation income for regular federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the fair market value of the stock at exercise and the option price (the bargain element). The employee's income tax basis in the stock is its fair market value at exercise. This is because the employee paid the option price to the employer (a cost basis) and included the remainder of the stock's value (bargain element) in his or her gross income as compensation (basis under the tax benefit principle). Thus, an immediate sale of the stock by the employee (there are no two-year and one-year holding periods for NQSOs) will produce zero capital gain or loss, since the amount realized would equal the adjusted basis for the stock.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Let us illustrate these principles by returning to our example involving Laura Johnson. If we assume the same facts, except that Laura was granted an NQSO instead of an ISO in 2003, the tax results would be as follows. Laura would have no gross income at grant of the option. However, when Laura exercised her NQSO in 2007, she would have had ordinary compensation income of \$30,000 in that year.4 Laura's income tax basis for the 1,000 shares is \$50,000, or \$50 per share (\$20 per share of cost basis and \$30 per share of basis due to that amount having already been taxed).

Now when Laura sells her 1,000 shares of Acme common in 2009 at a price of \$80 per share, she will realize long-term capital gain of \$30 per share, or \$30,000 (\$80 – \$50 = \$30 per share × 1,000 shares = \$30,000). Thus, for the NQSO, the total gain on the option stock would still be \$60,000, except that \$30,000 would be ordinary compensation income and \$30,000 would be long-term capital gain taxable at a maximum 15 percent rate.

<sup>3</sup>Employee stock options, of course, are not traded on organized or over-the-counter markets, may not be transferable, and normally are not vested at grant.

<sup>4</sup>Note that the AMT is not involved here because the \$30,000 bargain element is taxable for regular income tax purposes.

**Tax Treatment for the Employer** The employer gets a corporate income tax deduction for the amount of compensation income the employee realizes at exercise of the option.

## **Restricted Stock**

**Basic Characteristics** *Restricted stock plans* are arrangements whereby a corporation grants stock or stock options to an employee (or someone rendering services to the corporation), but where ownership of the stock is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, such as the employee's not remaining with the employer for a certain number of years or the corporation's not meeting certain profit goals. Such stock may be provided to employees in a variety of circumstances. It can be part of a general compensation package, perhaps to entice the person to go with the employer. It can be part of a bonus plan, as noted earlier. And in some cases, stock issued on exercise of an NQSO can be restricted stock in order to further postpone taxation.

**Tax Treatment to Employees and the Section 83(b) Election** As explained earlier, an employee receives ordinary compensation income in the year the employee's rights to the stock are first not subject to the substantial risk of forfeiture or are transferable. The gross income is measured by the fair market value of the stock at that time minus any cost to the employee. However, depending on the circumstances, a Section 83(b) election (described earlier) may be considered. A person receiving restricted stock must make a planning decision regarding this election.

#### **CASE EXAMPLES**

To illustrate these principles, let us assume that John Venturesome is a young information technology executive with a large corporation. Recently, a former college classmate invited him to join a newer start-up company (XYZ.com) that has some exciting new products in information technology. The offer is for less salary, but XYZ.com, which recently went public, will give John a compensation package that includes NQSOs and 10,000 shares of restricted stock (which is conditioned on John's staying with the company for at least three years). John does not have to pay anything for the 10,000 shares. XYZ.com common stock was selling at \$2 per share when the offer was made.

Assume that John accepted the offer in 2006 and made no Section 83(b) election. First, John had no gross income from receipt of the 10,000 shares of restricted stock, since it is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Let us further assume that at the end of three years (in 2009), John is still with XYZ.com and that its stock has done well. Its price in 2009 is \$20 per share. When the substantial risk of forfeiture ends in 2009, John will have ordinary compensation income of \$200,000 (10,000 shares × \$20 per share = \$200,000). His income tax basis in the 10,000 shares also will be \$200,000, or \$20 per share.

Now let us change our facts and assume John made the Section 83(b) election in 2006 within 30 days of when the 10,000 shares were transferred to him. He then would have be taxed on \$20,000 in year 2006 (\$2 per share × 10,000 shares = \$20,000) as ordinary compensation income and his basis in the 10,000 shares also would be \$20,000, or \$2 per share. If John is still with XYZ. com at the end of the three years in 2009, the substantial risk of forfeiture would end and he would have unrestricted rights to the stock. He would incur no further gross income. On the other hand, if John had left XYZ.com after, say, two years, he would forfeit the 10,000 shares and could have taken no tax deduction for that. In effect, he would lose the tax he paid in 2006 on the \$20,000 of ordinary income.

Let us now assume that John stayed with XYZ.com until 2009 and that two years later (in 2011) John sells the 10,000 shares for \$30 per share. If he had not made the Section 83(b) election in 2006, he would have \$100,000 of long-term capital gain (\$300,000 amount realized – \$200,000 adjusted basis = \$100,000 gain realized). In effect, he would have had \$300,000 of total gain on the 10,000 shares of restricted stock (\$200,000 of ordinary compensation income and \$100,000 of long-term capital gain). On the other hand, if John had made the Section 83(b) election in 2006, he would have \$280,000 of long-term capital gain (\$300,000 amount realized – \$20,000 adjusted basis = \$280,000 gain realized). In this situation, he also would have had \$300,000 of total gain on the 10,000 shares of restricted stock, but now it is divided as \$20,000 of ordinary compensation income and \$280,000 of long-term capital gain. Furthermore, if John does not sell the 10,000 shares (or all of them) during his lifetime, he can still consider the techniques described in Chapter 11 for possibly avoiding capital gains taxation. Finally, if he does not sell or otherwise dispose of his stock, it currently will get a stepped-up basis at death. But if the market price of the stock falls or it becomes worthless, John would have been better off not making the Section 83(b) election.

**Tax Treatment for the Employer** Again, the employer gets a corporate income tax deduction when the employee receives gross compensation income. This is either when the substantial risk of forfeiture ends or the Section 83(b) election is made.

#### **Other Stock-Based Plans**

This is a complex field, and only a brief description of some of these plans will be given here.

**Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs)** These are accounts, maintained for selected employees, that reflect the appreciation in the employer's stock over a certain period. When an executive's rights to an SAR become final, it normally is paid out to him or her in cash and is taxable then.

**Phantom Stock** These also are accounts maintained for selected employees, but they normally reflect the full value of a certain amount of employer stock. The account value varies with the stock's value and normally is paid to the executive in cash at some point. However, there is no actual stock in the account.

**Performance Shares or Performance-Based Stock Options** In this case, selected employees are granted stock or stock options whose vesting is contingent on certain corporate or other performance measures being met.

## **Provisions of Stock Option Plans Vesting of Options**

This is the period of continuous employment that must elapse after an option is granted and before the employee can exercise the option. There generally are vesting requirements in stock option plans. The periods required for vesting vary, but often range from two to four years.

## **Transferability of Options**

Traditionally, employee stock options have not been transferable by the employees receiving the options other than at death. They could not be sold or given away. One of the requirements to be an ISO is that the option by its terms must not be transferable (other than by will or intestate distribution) and must be exercisable during the employee's lifetime only by him or her.

There is no corresponding prohibition for NQSOs. But in the past, corporations in practice have not allowed their NQSOs to be transferable. Recently, however, some corporations have amended their stock option plans to allow NQSOs to be transferred by the holder to members of his or her family, trusts for such members, or possibly family limited partnerships with such members as partners, with the consent of the corporation.

## **Effect of Certain Contingencies on Options**

Stock option plans normally have certain forfeiture provisions in the event of termination of employment for various reasons. The option holder (or his or her estate or heirs) usually has a limited period to exercise the option after he or she retires (such as three to five years), becomes disabled on a long-term basis (such as three to five years), dies (such as one or two years), voluntarily terminates employment (such as three months), or for other reasons. Some plans also provide that options will be forfeited automatically if the holder becomes employed by or associated with a competitor of his or her former employer. In such a case, if an option holder is planning to change jobs and go with a competing firm, he or she should exercise favorable (i.e., "in the money") vested options before terminating employment.

### **Exercise of Options**

Stock options generally can be exercised in several ways.

**Cash Exercise** An option holder can make a *cash exercise* by paying the option price to the employer and having the stock transferred to him or her. In the case of NQSOs, the employer also will require withholding of federal, state, and local income taxes and FICA taxes on the taxable amount. The option holder must lay out the option price (and any withholding) in cash.

**Stock-for-Stock Exercise** A plan may allow payment of the exercise price by delivering previously owned shares of stock of the employer that are equal in value to the option price to the employer and having the option stock transferred to the option holder.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that Ahmed Bastor exercises NQSOs to buy 1,000 shares of ABC Corporation common stock at an option price of \$20 per share at a time when the fair market value of the stock is \$50 per share. Ahmed already owns ABC common through previous stock option exercises. In a stock-for-stock exercise, Ahmed could deliver 400 shares of his previously owned ABC common to the corporation in payment of the \$20,000 exercise price (1,000 shares × \$20 per share = \$20,000 exercise price ÷ \$50 per share = 400 shares of stock to deliver). Assume the 400 shares of

previously owned stock had an income tax basis to Ahmed of \$10 per share. There is no gain recognized on the exchange of the 400 previously owned shares for 400 of the new option shares, and the new shares will have the same holding period for capital gain purposes as the previously owned shares. This is because this is a tax-free exchange of common stock in a corporation for common stock in the same corporation, as provided in Section 1036 of the IRC.5

The income tax basis of the exchanged shares (\$10 per share) will be carried over to 400 of the new option shares. The remainder of the new option shares will be as if it were a cash exercise. The difference between the fair market value of the stock received (600 shares × \$50 per share = \$30,000) minus any cash paid for the stock (0 in this example) would be ordinary compensation income to Ahmed, and his income tax basis in these 600 shares would be \$50 per share (or \$30,000), which is the amount taken into his gross income for them. The corporation may require cash withholding or allow withholding in the form of stock otherwise issuable to the option holder. In this case, the option holder is paying for some of the new option stock with existing stock in the same corporation. This reduces the option holder's overall stock position in the company, as compared with a cash exercise, and is the reason reload options (discussed later) may be granted in this situation.

**Cashless Exercise** This type of exercise involves working through a stockbroker, who can buy the option stock from the corporation at the exercise price, sell enough stock in the open market to cover the purchase price plus broker's commissions and a small amount of margin interest, and then deliver the remaining stock to the option holder.

**Reload Options** These are additional options that may be granted to employees when they pay the exercise price for stock with previously owned stock of the corporation (a stock-for-stock exercise). The reload option normally is for the same number of shares used to pay the exercise price (plus, perhaps, shares used for federal, state, and local income taxes and FICA taxes for withholding tax purposes) and is for the remainder of the option period of the underlying option that was exercised.

A stock-for-stock exercise of an underlying option when there is a reload option can be attractive for an option holder. Using our previous example of

<sup>5</sup> See Chapter 10 for an explanation of this and other nonrecognition provisions in the tax code.

Ahmed Bastor, assume that ABC's plan provides for reload options. In this case, if the underlying option Ahmed exercised originally had a term of 10 years and Ahmed engaged in the stock-for-stock exercise described previously 4 years after the grant date, he might be granted a reload option for 400 shares (ignoring, for the sake of simplicity, any stock used for tax withholding purposes) at an option price of \$50 per share (the current fair market value of the stock) for a term of 6 years (the remaining term of the exercised underlying option).

Compared with a cash exercise and a stock-for-stock exercise with no reload option, Ahmed now is in a better position. Under a cash exercise, he would have an exposure to ABC Corporation stock of 1,400 directly owned shares (400 previously owned and 1,000 option shares), but he would have had to come up with the \$20,000 needed to exercise the underlying option. Under a stock-for-stock exercise with no reload feature, Ahmed's exposure to ABC stock would be reduced to 1,000 directly owned shares (the option shares). However, under the stock-for-stock exercise with a reload feature, his exposure to ABC stock remains at 1,400 shares (1,000 directly owned option shares and 400 reload option shares), but he would not have needed to disturb his other assets or cash reserves to exercise the underlying option. This occurs because Ahmed has been given a new option (the reload option), which itself has value.

## **Valuation of Stock Options**

This is a complex subject. It is made even more so by the fact that employee stock options are different in many ways from publicly traded stock and other options discussed in Chapter 5. In essence, however, employee stock options are really call options for the employees on employer stock.

People may be concerned about the valuation of employee stock options for many reasons. Employees want to know what these options are really worth, since they have become an important part of many compensation arrangements. They also need to be valued for purposes of an employee's asset allocation planning, as noted in Chapter 9. In some cases, employees may give up cash compensation in exchange for stock options and so they want to have an idea of what the options are worth to evaluate the exchange. Finally, employee stock options may need to be valued for estate planning purposes.

#### **Traded Options**

The market prices of publicly traded options are readily available in the financial press and from other sources. Employee stock options, of course, are not publicly traded and have no readily ascertainable market value.

Most traded options are for relatively short durations, such as a few months. However, just to get an idea of how the market values longer-term options relative to the prices of the underlying stocks, it may be instructive to note the market premiums (prices) for leaps. *Leaps* are longer-term publicly traded options. For example, at one point, the price of a 30-month call option on one major company's stock with a strike price of \$115 when the underlying stock's current market price was \$941/16 (i.e., this call option was out of the money) was \$40 per share, or about 42.5 percent of the underlying stock's market price.

Naturally, the prices of such publicly traded long-term options will vary with the characteristics of the underlying stocks and market conditions. The only point we are making here is that the market itself sets a considerable value on longer-term options, even when they have no intrinsic value. Clearly then, the market value (as well as the economic value) of long-term options can be substantial.

#### **Intrinsic Value**

As noted in Chapters 9 and 10, the intrinsic value of a stock option is the difference between the underlying stock's current market price and the option's strike price. For example, if an employee is granted a 10-year NQSO with an option price of \$25 per share when the underlying stock's market price also is \$25 per share, the intrinsic value of the option is \$0 at grant. As we have just seen for traded options, the intrinsic value does not reflect the fair value or economic worth of an option. In fact, as will be shown in the next section, the economic worth of a long-term option, such as that previously cited, can be quite substantial.

#### **Option Pricing Models**

A number of models (mathematical systems of analysis) have been developed to compute the fair value or economic worth of options. Probably the best known is the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model is based on the following six factors to determine the economic value of an option.6 (Let us say for the following illustration of these factors that we are valuing an employee stock option.)

<sup>6</sup>The concept behind these option pricing models is that the fair value of an option (which, in general, is an instrument that allows but does not require a person to buy or sell an asset at a prearranged price during a set period) consists of two elements: the intrinsic value and a time value, arising because the option holder may benefit from favorable future price movements (volatility) in the asset without having the downside risk of actual ownership of the asset.

- N Option exercise price (strike price).
- N Current market price of the underlying stock.
- N Risk-free interest rate during the expected term of the option.
- N Expected dividend yield on the stock.
- N Expected life of the option. The expected life is the time period the employee is actually expected to hold the option before exercising it. It may be shorter than the maximum option period in the plan.
- N Expected volatility of the underlying stock's market price. This normally is the most important factor in the model. The greater the expected volatility, the more likely there will be time value gains (see Footnote 6) and the greater the option value will be. Volatility can be estimated from the historical standard deviation of the stock's price changes over past periods.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

To illustrate the *fair value* of an option, let us continue our fact pattern for the NQSO noted earlier with respect to intrinsic value. Using the factors just listed, we assume that this NQSO has an option exercise price of \$25 per share, a current market price of the underlying stock of \$25 per share, an assumed risk-free interest rate of 5 percent, an expected dividend yield of 0, an assumed expected life of the option of 10 years, and an expected volatility of the underlying stock's price of 20 percent per month. Under these assumptions, the Black-Scholes model would produce a fair value of \$19.75 per option. This equals 79 percent of the underlying stock's current price. Of course, if the assumed expected life of the option were reduced, the fair value would decline. For example, if the expected life were one year, the fair value would be \$7.24 per option. Most employee stock options have an expected life of considerably more than one year. Software is available for calculating the fair value of options under option pricing models.

It is clear from this discussion that the *economic value* (fair value) of stock options granted to employees can be substantial. However, it must also be recognized that the *actual value* of such options may never reach the fair value at grant (from an option pricing model) and may even be zero if the actual market price of the underlying stock should decline or fail to rise from the option price.

Sometimes when a stock's price falls and many executive stock options are "under water" (i.e., the stock's market price is below the option price and the option is out of the money), the employer will *reprice the options* to be equal to the stock's current market price (i.e., cancel the old out-of-the-money options and issue new ones at the stock's current market value). However, this is a controversial tactic.

## **Some Caveats Concerning Stock Options and Other Plans**

While employee stock options and other stock compensation plans have been a boon for many employees and a bonanza for some, some caveats concerning them are in order.

## **What Goes Up Can Come Down!**

It seems almost trite to say that while employee stock plans can be attractive when the price of a company's stock is rising, the reverse will be true when the price is falling. However, some employees may not truly understand this. They can overcommit themselves financially on the basis of paper gains in their stock options and other plans.

#### **Some Employees May Not Realize the True Economic Worth of Options**

The other side of the coin is that some employees may not truly understand, or may have difficulty in analyzing, the economic value of options or other stock rights granted to them.

## **Risk of Excessive Concentration in Employer Stock**

While employees usually are well advised to take advantage of these plans when such plans are attractive to them, they also should deal with any overconcentration issue, assuming they want a reasonably diversified investment portfolio.

## **Planning Issues Regarding Stock Options and Other Stock Plans**

Some of these issues may be summarized as follows:

- N Whether to participate in employee stock purchase plan offerings. This depends on the terms of the plan and the employer stock. In general, these plans are advantageous for employees and are flexible as to whether participating employees will take the stock.
- N When to exercise stock options. This can be a complicated issue. An employee can simply hold a vested, unexercised option for as long as possible before exercising it. In this case, he or she can benefit from the underlying stock's possible increase in price over the options' exercise price without actually committing any funds, and delaying income taxation in

the case of NQSOs until exercise. This is attractive if the stock's price does increase during the remaining option period. It also can be attractive if income tax rates on ordinary compensation income (such as will arise from exercising NQSOs) are expected to decline in the future. But if the concern is that the stock's price may fall and not really ever recover during the remaining option period, it is better to exercise now and sell the stock as soon as possible. Also, if overconcentration in employer stock is an issue, as it often is, the exercise of NQSOs and immediate sale of the stock can be a tax-efficient remedy, since compensation income must be realized at some point anyway and there is no capital gain on immediate sale because the basis is equal to fair market value at exercise.

- N Whether, in effect, to change an ISO into an NQSO by breaking an ISO requirement (i.e., making a disqualifying disposition by sale of the stock within one year of exercise). This may be done to avoid an AMT problem or if the stock's price is expected to fall dramatically. A planning technique that may be used in this situation is *AMT neutralization.* In AMT neutralization, the employee sells enough ISO shares (after exercise) in disqualifying dispositions so that his or her regular tax for the year becomes equal to his or her AMT. Then there is no AMT to pay.
- N How to exercise options (including possible availability of reload options).
- N Whether to make a Section 83(b) election with regard to restricted stock or other plans.
- N Whether to take option stock as restricted stock, if available under the plan. This is done to further delay recognition of income on exercise of NQSOs.
- N Whether to take bonuses or other compensation in the form of stock options, if available.
- N How to maintain investment diversification in light of possible favorable terms for acquiring more employer stock.
- N Any estate planning actions with regard to stock plans. This might include making gifts of NQSOs if allowed by the plan. However, such gifts should be analyzed carefully. It also may include the exercise of any in-the-money unexercised NQSOs before death (e.g., a "death bed exercise") for estate tax reasons.
