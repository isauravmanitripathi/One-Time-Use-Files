This chapter covers individual annuities sold to the public as investments. They have become a major financial product for many people. These contracts are called nonqualified annuities to contrast them with the qualified retirement plans provided by employers to their employers and covered in Chapter 13.

### **Fundamental Purposes of Annuities**

Traditionally, in its payout phase, a *life annuity* (or an *immediate life annuity*) involves an individual paying an insurance company a specified sum (called the *annuity consideration,* or *premium*) in exchange for a promise that the insurer will make a series of periodic payments to the individual (called the *annuitant*) for as long as he or she lives. Thus, the basic purpose of any life annuity is to assure the annuitant an income he or she cannot outlive.

However, modern individual annuity contracts permit the payout of accumulated funds (cash value) in a variety of ways. In fact, relatively few individual annuities today are taken as a life income. For tax purposes, then, another purpose of nonqualified annuities is to provide an investment vehicle whose earnings grow inside the annuity, income tax-deferred, until they are taken as distributions from the annuity.

Conceptually, the income from a life annuity should be relatively large compared with other investment returns because the annuity principle involves the gradual liquidation of the purchase price (principal) of the annuity over the annuitant's lifetime. Thus, each life annuity payment consists partly of liquidation of principal and partly of investment income. When the life annuitant or annuitants die, the annuity consideration is entirely liquidated (except possibly for minor refund features), and nothing (or little) remains for their heirs. This sometimes is called the mortality risk or annuity risk in life annuities. It exists for all life annuities.

## **Types of Individual Annuities**

Investment annuities can be classified in several ways.

#### **Who Determines Investments and Bears Investment Risks**

A fundamental issue is whether the annuity owner or the insurance company makes investment decisions and bears investment risks.

**Fixed-Dollar Annuities** In these annuities, the cash-value accumulation is a stated dollar amount that is guaranteed by the insurance company and on which the insurer pays a specified or determinable rate of interest. Investment authority and investment risks are borne by the insurance company. The assets behind these annuities are invested in the general assets of the insurance company; hence, they are referred to as *portfolio products.* In the unlikely case the insurer should become insolvent, fixed-dollar annuity owners would become general creditors of the insurer.

**Variable Annuities (VAs)** Under this type, the annuity owner can choose from among a number of different investment funds or subaccounts into which he or she wishes to place the annuity premiums. The owner also has the option of moving his or her annuity contributions and the cash values among the various subaccounts at reasonable intervals.

These subaccounts are managed by or for the insurance company. They are not part of the general assets of the insurer, but are part of one or more separate accounts maintained by the insurer. The separate accounts are organized as investment companies (normally as unit investment trusts as described in Chapter 8). Their investment results stand on their own. Therefore, the cash values of VAs depend on the investment experience of the particular subaccount or accounts into which the cash values have been allocated by the annuity owner. Thus, investment risks reside with the annuity owner.

The separate accounts also are not subject to the claims of the insurance company's creditors. Thus, they are not subject to any insolvency risk of the insurance company. The available subaccounts depend on the particular contract involved. However, annuity owners generally have a wide range of investment options.

This variable annuity concept also applies when accumulated values are taken as variable retirement benefits. At this time, the current value of the investment fund is converted into units of retirement income (often called *annuity units*), and the annuitant receives an income of so many annuity units per month. The value of these annuity units depends on the investment experience of the fund in which the annuity accumulation is invested. This may be one of the payout options under an annuity.

**Combination Plans** Individual annuities may give annuity owners the choice of putting their annuity values in a fixed-dollar fund (stable value fund), in one or more variable funds, or in a combination of fixed and variable accounts.

**Equity Indexed Annuities (EIAs)** These technically are fixed-dollar annuities. They combine minimum insurance company guarantees with linking of interest earnings on the cash value to a stock market index.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

As an example of an EIA, a person might pay a premium of \$100,000 for a single-premium deferred EIA. The policy guarantees a minimum value of, say, 90 percent of this principal amount (\$90,000) increased by a guaranteed interest rate of, say, 3 percent each year. The value of the EIA will not fall below

#### **418 Part V. Retirement Planning and Other Employee Benefits**

this minimum guarantee. In addition, if it is higher, the policy will pay a percentage (which varies among policies, but let us say 85 percent here) of the increase in an equity index (say the S&P 500) over a period, which might be five years. This percentage of the index increase is called the *participation rate.* Thus, if the increase in the S&P 500 over the five years were, for example, 80 percent (or a 12.47 percent average annual compound rate of return), the interest credited for this index increase would be \$68,000 (80 percent index increase × 85 percent participation rate × \$100,000 = \$68,000), and the accumulated value of the EIA would be \$168,000 (which, of course, is greater than the guaranteed value for this period). The annuity then could continue for additional periods. However, if the S&P 500 stock index were to decline, the EIA owner still would have the minimum guaranteed cash value at the minimum guaranteed interest rate. This is only an example to illustrate the principles involved. The design features in EIAs being sold can differ markedly and cause considerable differences in total returns.1

Insurance company EIAs were patterned after bank-offered market-linked CDs, which were described in Chapter 7. However, EIAs are annuities, so the inside buildup is not currently taxed. This is not true for bank CDs. However, the CDs normally are covered by FDIC insurance, while the EIAs are not.

#### **Methods of Paying Premiums**

**Flexible-Premium Annuities** These contracts allow the annuity owner the discretion of when to pay periodic premiums. Premiums can be discontinued or changed at the owner's option. This approach may be referred to as *flexible-premium deferred annuities.*

**Single-Premium Annuities** Here, the contract is purchased with a single lump-sum payment. The single premium may be paid well in advance of when benefits are to be taken from the annuity (a *single-premium deferred annuity,* or SPDA), or it may be paid just before annuity payments are to begin (a *single-premium immediate annuity*).

<sup>1</sup>The insurance companies themselves may finance these products by using the premiums they receive to purchase a portfolio of fixed bonds to cover the guaranteed part of the EIA and then purchase options on stock indexes or other option arrangements to cover the equity index part.

#### **When Annuity Payments Begin**

**Deferred Annuities** As just noted, a *deferred annuity* is one under which the benefits will not be payable until some years in the future. They essentially involve the tax-deferred growth of capital over time.

**Immediate Annuities** On the other hand, an *immediate annuity* is one in which the benefits begin as soon as the purchase price is paid. An immediate annuity might be purchased at retirement by someone ready to start receiving lifetime retirement benefits at that time.

**Annuity Starting Date** As its name implies, this is when annuity payments begin. Under the tax law, it is the first day of the first period (e.g., month) for which an amount is received as an annuity.

# **Parties to the Annuity Contract**

These are the annuity owner, the annuitant, the beneficiary, and the issuing insurance company. In most instances, the annuity owner and the annuitant are the same person. The *annuity owner* is the person or entity who owns the rights under an annuity contract. The *annuitant* is the person whose life generally determines the timing and amount of any payout affected by life expectancy. In other words, the annuitant's life is used in determining any life income payments. The *beneficiary* is the person or entity named in the contract to receive the death benefit in the event the owner or annuitant dies before the benefits are paid from the annuity. In the event that the beneficiary is the deceased owner's surviving spouse, he or she is allowed by the tax law to treat the annuity as his or her own and to continue it as the new owner. The *insurance company* is the life insurance company issuing the contract.

# **Phases of Annuities**

Individual annuities have an accumulation phase and a distribution phase. During the *accumulation phase,* contributions are made to the annuity and it is a capital-accumulation device. There is no legal or tax limit on the amount of annual contributions (or single premiums) that an annuity owner can make. However, contributions are made after taxes.

The *distribution phase* is when the owner receives benefits or payouts from the annuity. Distributions generally can be made at the owner's option, except for certain limiting factors. First, most annuities have reducing surrender charges if distributions are taken during the early years of the contract. Surrender charges are completely eliminated after a certain period, such as 10 years or even younger. However, annuities often allow the annuity owner to withdraw, say, up to 10 percent of the cash value during the period without a charge. Second, individual annuities are subject to the 10 percent penalty tax on premature distributions (before age 59½), with certain exceptions. Finally, annuity contracts generally specify a maximum age by which benefits must commence. However, this age may be quite advanced, such as age 85 or even 95. There is no tax law RBD for nonqualified annuities.

## **Investment Returns on Annuities**

Important considerations in deciding whether to purchase an annuity or in deciding which one(s) to purchase are the rate of annual investment return that may be expected (in relation to investment risk) and the expense charges (direct and indirect) that are levied by insurers. Investment returns are discussed here; expense charges are discussed in the next section.

### **Returns on Fixed-Dollar Annuities**

For this type of annuity, the insurance company specifies an *initial credited interest rate* that it will pay on the cash accumulation under the contract. This rate (or perhaps several alternative rates) often is guaranteed by the insurer for a specified period. This may be called the *yield guarantee.* This period can vary among insurers and annuity contracts from as little as 1 year to as long as 10 years. After any yield guarantee period ends, the insurer can set monthly or annually the interest rate it will pay in the future on the cash accumulation. This is the *current yield* or *current credited interest rate.* It can be increased or decreased by the insurer and often is less than the initial credited rate. However, fixed-dollar annuities also have a *minimum guaranteed interest rate,*  below which the insurer cannot set its current rate. Also, some annuities have what is referred to as a *bailout escape rate* or *bailout provision* under which, if the current rate declared by the insurer falls below a certain level, the annuity owner can withdraw all funds in the annuity or exchange the annuity for another without a surrender charge. Thus, the minimum guaranteed rate and possibly a bailout rate provide some protection to annuity owners against declines in current interest rates. However, in recent years guaranteed rate on new policies have been lowered by many insurers or based on an index.

The current rate usually applies to all monies received for the annuity, regardless of when they were paid or received. In other words, there is one current rate set by the insurer based on the insurer's return on its own general investment portfolio. These may be called *portfolio-rated products.*  A few insurers base their current rates on some outside market interest rate (such as a U.S. Treasury securities rate), so it changes with market conditions. These sometimes are called *interest-indexed annuities* (IIAs). At least one insurer uses a *new money approach* where the current rate depends on when the annuity considerations were paid to the insurer.

When it comes to fixed-dollar annuities, it may be helpful for consumers to review some current interest rate history for the annuity or annuities being considered. However, the general reputation and financial ratings of the insurer are very important, since it is the insurer's financial strength that stands behind its contracts and their returns. Purchasers should not be unduly attracted by an unusually high initial interest rate (possibly a *teaser rate*). First, the insurer normally lowers this rate after the yield guarantee period ends (which may be comparatively short, such as one year). Furthermore, it may not be financially sound for the insurer to offer rates that are too much out of line with market conditions, and this may financially weaken the insurer.

Fixed-dollar annuities are a guaranteed principal product and will be attractive during periods of rising interest rates. This is because their cash value is fixed and thus generally will not decline with rising interest rates, as will bond prices. Except that, in recent years some insurers have added *market value adjustments* (MVAs) to new annuity contracts which will reduce annuity values when market interest rates rise and increase them when market rates fall. In addition, current crediting rates will rise because insurers will be earning more on their general portfolios, and competition will force them to raise their current rates to maintain their annuity business.

On the other hand, during periods of low or declining interest rates in the economy, the reverse will be true. Current rates on annuities will decline, but their cash value will remain fixed. Bonds, on the other hand, will rise in price in the face of declining interest rates, unless they are called. Again, since no one knows what the future will bring, a diversified asset allocation strategy seems best for most people.

#### **Returns on Variable Annuities**

Here, investment returns depend on the performance of the subaccount or accounts to which the annuity funds are allocated. Therefore, a prospective purchaser should evaluate the past investment performance of the insurer (or other investment manager) over a reasonably long time (such as 10 or even 20 years) with respect to those separate accounts, much as should be done when buying investment company shares or variable life insurance. Consumers also may evaluate the variety of the subaccounts included in the investment options under the contract. Some annuities have more and better options than others.

#### **Returns on EIAs**

EIAs vary considerably in their design characteristics. This can have a significant impact on their returns. Some of the features that can affect results are the equity index used, the participation rate, any caps on the gain in the equity index that is credited to the annuity value, how the interest based on the equity index is calculated (the calculation method), the minimum cash-value guarantee (sometimes called the *guaranteed minimum account value—*GMAV), the minimum guaranteed interest rate, and a possible account charge. A number of equity indexes are used. The one used in the particular EIA selected involves at least some degree of investment strategy. For example, use of a broad index, like the commonly used S&P 500 stock index, implies an index investing strategy. Participation rates vary widely. In the previous example, we assumed an 85 percent participation rate, but these rates can range from 55 percent to more than 100 percent. There are a number of calculation methods. In the previous example, the point-to-point method was used. Other methods include a ladder method, high water/low water method, and ratchet designs.

For asset allocation purposes, EIAs perhaps should be considered equity investments, since the expectation normally is that the equity indexed interest will outpace the GMAV. However, returns on EIAs may be lower than those on other equity investments, such as directly owned stocks and stock mutual funds, because of possible participation rates below 100 percent, possible caps on interest credits, and the fact that equity indexes (like the S&P 500) do not include dividends paid on the common stocks in the index. They are indexes of the market prices of stocks.

### **Expense Charges on Annuities**

There are two broad categories of charges: sales or surrender charges (loads) and other, usually annual, charges.

### **Sales Charges**

Sometimes a sales charge is deducted from the premiums when an annuity is purchased; this is called a *front-end load.* The trend in the insurance industry, however, is not to impose front-end loads on individual annuities, but rather to levy a *surrender charge* if more than a certain amount (often, more than 10 percent of the annuity value per year) is withdrawn or surrendered within a specified period after purchase (such as 7 or 10 years). Technically, this is a contingent-deferred sales charge, but it is popularly known as a *back-end load.* Back-end loads normally are a diminishing percentage of the annuity

#### **Individual Investment Annuity Contracts 423**

value and, while they vary among insurers, might start at 7 or 8 percent of the annuity value in the first year and then decline year by year to become zero by, say, the tenth year. Back-end loads tend to discourage annuity owners from exchanging or surrendering their annuities during the period in which such surrender charges may be imposed. However, some variable annuities do not levy any sales load or surrender charge or impose reduced loads or charges. These may be called no-load or low-load contracts. They are analogous to no-load or low-load mutual funds.

#### **Periodic Expense Charges**

In the case of *fixed-dollar annuities,* there often are no separately stated annual fees (other than possibly a small maintenance fee). Rather, the insurer recovers its costs from the spread between the current interest rate it pays on the annuity value and the rate it can earn on its own investment portfolio. Thus, for fixed-dollar annuities, there usually are no front-end sales loads and no separately charged annual fees. However, there generally is a surrender charge (back-end load).

For *variable annuities,* the situation is different. There always are annual charges levied against the contract's accumulated value, whether or not there are any sales or surrender charges. These annual charges fall into two general categories: *contract charges (policy-level expenses)*, which do not vary with the particular subaccount or accounts selected, and fund or *portfolio operating expenses (fund-level expenses)*, which do vary with the subaccount or accounts selected. Contract charges are insurance-type charges and administrative expenses. They are the mortality and expense (M&E) risk charge, which may include elements for administrative expenses, sales expenses, a risk charge for standard death benefits, and insurer profits. Fund-level charges are investment management fees and administrative expenses for managing the particular subaccounts. They are somewhat analogous to expense ratios for mutual funds. Both of these kinds of charges are customarily expressed as percentages of a fund's average net assets. In addition, there are charges for any guaranteed minimum benefit riders the annuity owner may have purchased. Guaranteed minimum benefits are discussed later in this chapter.

These annual charges can be significant in affecting total returns under variable annuities. Annual policy-level M&E charges can vary from 0.50 to 1.65 percent (or more) of assets, while annual fund-level charges vary according to particular subaccounts, typically being lower for money market and domestic bond funds and higher for growth stock, specialty, and international funds. On average, however, total combined annual charges might run 2.10 percent of assets or more. However, as just noted, these combined annual expenses can vary considerably among different variable annuities. This is an important factor to consider for purchasers of variable annuities.

# **Withdrawals and Loans**

Individual annuities normally permit withdrawals from the cash value at any time, but they may be subject to a surrender charge during the surrender period. Some also permit loans against the cash value, but loans against annuities are rare because loans are considered taxable distributions. For annuity contracts issued after January 18, 1985, any amount withdrawn (or taken as a loan) prior to age 59½ will be subject to the 10 percent penalty tax on premature distributions, with some exceptions. In addition to reaching age 59½, other exceptions are the person's disability or death, when payments are made in substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the annuitant or the joint lives or life expectancies of the annuitant and his or her beneficiary, and for the purchase of an immediate annuity.

## **Exchanges of Annuities**

Annuity contracts can be exchanged tax free for other annuity contracts under the terms of Section 1035 of the IRC. Thus, if an annuity owner is dissatisfied with the service, yield, or security of his or her individual deferred annuity, the owner can exchange the contract for another annuity contract without current income tax consequences. However, such exchanges of annuity contracts may give rise to back-end loads.

## **Fixed or Variable Annuity (Payout) Options**

Depending on the policy involved, annuity benefits can be payable in a stated number of dollars or as variable annuity units in a separate subaccount. Fixed-dollar annuities normally provide stated dollar payouts, while variable annuities may provide either variable payouts or fixed payouts at the option of the annuity owner.

## **Annuity Payment Options**

These options vary somewhat from one annuity contract to another, but some common ones include cash surrender of all or part of the accumulated value, installment payments over a fixed period or in a fixed amount, straight life annuity, joint life and survivor annuity, and various life annuities with refund features.

### **Annuity Death Benefits**

While individual annuities are primarily capital accumulation and liquidation vehicles, the owner does name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive the accumulated value in the event of the owner's death before this value is paid out. It should be noted, however, that there are no life insurance proceeds involved in such an annuity death benefit. Individual annuity contracts normally allow the annuity owner or the beneficiary to select one or more payout options for the death benefit.

In connection with variable annuities, the *standard death benefit* is the larger of the amount the owner invested in the policy (minus any withdrawals) or the policy's cash value. This means that if the cash value in a subaccount or accounts (such as a common stock account) should decline below the owner's investment in the contract (net premiums paid), there would be a mortality risk element equal to the difference. This can be important in declining markets. Some variable annuity contracts have other, *enhanced death benefit*, provisions. One of these is the stepped-up death benefit. Here, the death benefit is reset at periodic intervals (such as every five years) at the then-current cash value. From then on, it will not be less than this amount, or, in some annuities, the highest reset amount (high-point death benefit). Another provision increases the death benefit by a stated percentage (such as 5 percent) each year. There normally are additional asset-based percentage charges for enhanced death benefits. The consumer should evaluate whether these additional charges are worth the death protection, compared with just buying life insurance. Also, it should be noted that the difference between the annuity owner's basis in the contract (normally the premium paid) and the death benefit (standard or enhanced) is taxable IRD to the beneficiary. On the other hand, life insurance death proceeds are income tax–free to the beneficiary. Once annuity payments have commenced, any death benefit will depend on the payout option selected.

The IRC requires that for contracts issued after January 18, 1985, to be considered annuities for tax purposes (i.e., to be taxed under Section 72 of the IRC), the contracts must meet certain distribution rules in the event of an annuity owner's death. If the owner's death occurs before the annuity starting date, his or her entire interest in the contract must be distributed within five years after the owner's death. But if the owner's death occurs on or after the annuity starting date and before his or her entire interest has been distributed, the remaining interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the distribution method being used at the owner's death. However, under both of these rules, if part or all of an owner's interest is to be distributed to a beneficiary over the life of the beneficiary, or over a period that does not exceed the life expectancy of the beneficiary, and if such distribution begins within one year of the owner's death, that portion will be treated as if it had been distributed on the day the distribution began. Furthermore, if a deceased owner's spouse is the beneficiary, these requirements treat the surviving spouse as the annuity owner for the future.

### **Guaranteed Minimum Benefits Under Variable Annuities (VAs)**

There are a number of guaranteed minimum benefits riders that can be added to nonqualified VAs. Many insurance companies offer them and they have been very popular with VA owners. The terms and costs of these riders vary considerably among insurers and there had been considerable competition among insurers in their sale to the public. Insurers make a separate annual percentage charge against the VA's accumulated value for these riders. However, as of this writing, insurance companies are cutting back on these guaranteed benefits and increasing their asset-based charges for them due to the difficult stock market and economic climate.2

#### **Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits (GMDBs)**

For VAs, they are represented by the standard death benefit (financed by a portion of the M&E risk charge) and enhanced death benefits for which a separate asset based charge may be levied.

#### **Guaranteed Minimum Living Benefits (GMLBs)**

In contrast to GMDBs, these guarantee retirement benefits in various forms during the annuitant's lifetime. They can be classified as guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (GMABs), guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIBs), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWBs), or some combination of these guarantees.

<sup>2</sup> Insurers generally use financial hedging techniques to attempt to protect themselves against stock market declines with respect to these products.

**Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefits (GMABs)** These are provisions usually guaranteeing that the value of a benefit base in the VA will increase at a certain rate regardless of how the subaccount or accounts in which the VA owner actually invested perform. This may take the form of periodically (e.g., quarterly) locking in the investment gains in a benefit base if the owner does not take withdrawals. Thus, the benefit base will hold its gains (i.e., they are locked in) even if the subaccount values should decline. Another form is to guarantee that purchase payments (annuity considerations) will increase a benefit base at a guaranteed rate, such as 5 percent or even 7 percent, for a period of time, such as 10 years. The same result can be achieved by guaranteeing that the benefit base will double in a certain number of years. The effect of these guarantees is that the VA contract has an *actual accumulation value (cash value)*. These are determined by the actual performance of the investment subaccounts the owner selects, the annuity's expense charges (as well as other transactions), and one or more benefit bases which will be determined by the contract guarantees just mentioned and will normally be different (more or less) than the actual cash value.

**Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits (GMIBs)** These benefits often guarantee a future lifetime annuity income based on a guaranteed benefit base. GMIBs normally apply after the VA has been in force for a given period, such as 10 years, and require life annuitization. Thus, the life annuity principle applies once the GMIB starts.

**Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits (GMWBs)** In this case, the insurer guarantees that the annuitant can withdraw up to a specified percentage (such as 5 percent at age 55) of the accumulated value as long as the annuitant lives. The percentage guaranteed increases with the annuitant's age. However, the remaining accumulated value (after the guaranteed withdrawals) remains available to the annuitant or his or her heirs after the annuitant's death. In other words, GMWBs do not require annuitization and may be available immediately on purchase of an immediate annuity.

#### **Long-Term Care (LTC) Riders to Annuity Contracts**

These insurance coverages may be added as riders (endorsements) to an annuity or life insurance contract. LTC insurance is covered in Chapter 23.

This approach likely will attain increased importance starting in 2010, because PPA of 2006 provides significant tax advantages for such *combination contracts* (annuities or life insurance and LTC contracts) starting after December 31, 2009. PPA of 2006 provides that charges against the cash value of such a combination contract for qualified LTC coverage will not be considered gross income for federal income tax purposes. This means the taxdeferred inside buildup of an annuity policy (or life insurance policy) can be used tax free to pay for LTC coverage. In this case, the income tax basis of the annuity contract (or life insurance policy) will be reduced by such nontaxed charges. However, the effect of this basis adjustment will be to defer, probably for a long time, the tax on the LTC charges because the lower basis will result in a larger untaxed buildup in the annuity contract which will be taxed upon distribution at some point in the future.

# **Underwriting of Individual Annuities**

Unlike life insurance (discussed in Chapter 21), individual annuity contracts generally are not subject to any medical underwriting (selection) by the insurance company issuing them. The early death of a life annuitant actually will be financially beneficial to the insurer.

However, some insurance companies write medically underwritten immediate life annuities. In this case, the insurers do consider the medical condition of the prospective annuitant and will offer better life annuity rates to persons in poorer health (referred to as "impaired lives").

# **Taxation of Nonqualified Annuities**

Taxation of nonqualified annuities can be complex. Only the basic principles are presented here.

#### **Federal Income Taxation**

An annuity owner's *investment in the contract* (income tax basis in the contract) is the owner's premiums paid minus any nontaxed distributions. Since this amount has been paid with after-tax dollars, the owner (or his or her beneficiary at death) is entitled to this amount back tax free when benefits are taken from the annuity.

**Accumulation Phase (Inside Buildup)** The investment earnings of an annuity contract increase or decrease without current income taxation or losses. This is the famous *tax-deferred inside buildup of annuity cash values,* and is one of the main advantages of individual (nonqualified) deferred annuities. For variable annuities, the owner can also move the cash value between or among the subaccounts within the annuity without this being considered a sale or exchange for capital gains tax purposes.

**Annuities Held Other Than by Natural Persons** The previous tax-deferral principle does not apply when contributions have been made after February 28,

#### **Individual Investment Annuity Contracts 429**

1986, for a deferred annuity that is not held by a natural person. This would include deferred annuity contracts held by corporations, charitable remainder trusts, and certain other entities. When a contract is held by a non-natural person, it is not treated as an annuity under Section 72 of the IRC, and income earned by the contract (the inside buildup) will be taxed as ordinary income to the owner for that year. However, this provision does not apply to annuities held by an estate because of the owner's death; annuities held by qualified retirement plans, TSAs, and IRAs; immediate annuities; and annuities held by trusts or other entities as agents for natural persons.

**Annuity Payments (Periodic Distributions)** These payments are taxed under the general annuity rules of Section 72 of the IRC.3 Under these rules, an owner of a fixed-dollar annuity determines the ratio of his or her investment in the contract to the expected return (the annual payment times the annuitant's life expectancy in years) from the contract and excludes a similar proportion of each annuity payment from his or her gross income. This ratio is the exclusion ratio. For variable annuities, the excluded amount is determined by dividing the owner's investment in the contract by the annuitant's life expectancy in years.

For annuity starting dates after December 31, 1986, the exclusion continues until the owner's investment in the contract is recovered, and then the annuity payments are fully taxable. For prior annuity starting dates, the exclusion goes on even after the owner's investment in the contract is recovered. If an owner-annuitant should die before recovering the premiums tax free, the remainder would be deductible on his or her final income tax return.

**Amounts Not Received as an Annuity** Section 72 also deals with distributions that are not received as an annuity. These include nonperiodic distributions before the annuity starting date, such as cash withdrawals, loans, and surrenders.

*Surrenders:* If an annuity contract is entirely surrendered for cash, the difference between the cash surrender value and the investment in the contract is taxed as ordinary income in the year of the surrender. This normally is not a desirable strategy unless there are special circumstances.

*Cash Withdrawals:* If there are partial withdrawals on annuities issued after August 13, 1982, they are viewed for tax purposes as coming first from any untaxed investment earnings in the contract and are taxed as

<sup>3</sup>This is the same general concept as discussed in Chapter 16 for periodic distributions from qualified retirement plans, except there are special exceptions for qualified plans that do not apply to nonqualified annuities. Nonqualified annuities are taxed only under the general annuity rules.

#### **430 Part V. Retirement Planning and Other Employee Benefits**

ordinary income until such investment earnings are exhausted. Once the inside buildup is exhausted, further withdrawals are viewed as a return of the investment in the contract and are income tax–free. This can be termed an *interest first* concept of taxation and is the opposite from that generally employed for partial withdrawals from life insurance contracts that are not modified endowment contracts (MECs). For nonqualified annuities issued on or before August 13, 1982, partial surrenders are considered to come first (untaxed) from the investment in the contract like life insurance.

*Loans:* For income tax purposes, these are considered distributions from the contract and hence, are taxable the same as just described for partial withdrawals. This also is the opposite from the treatment of policy loans from life insurance policies that are not MECs and loans from qualified retirement plans.

*Gifts of Annuities:* For annuity contracts issued after April 22, 1987, the transfer of an annuity for less than full and adequate consideration (i.e., gift of the annuity) will be treated for income tax purposes as if the ownertransferor had received an amount not received as an annuity equal to the difference between the cash value at the time of the gift and the investment in the contract. This amount is taxable to the owner-transferor at that time as ordinary income. Thus, gifts of annuities generally will trigger taxation to the donor of the untaxed inside buildup. Therefore, while gifts of life insurance often are attractive for estate planning reasons, the same is not true for gifts of deferred annuities. This rule does not apply to gifts of annuities between spouses or incident to divorce.

*Death:* At the death of an annuity owner, the difference between the annuity's accumulated value and the decedent's investment in the contract is IRD to the beneficiary, according to the principles explained in Chapter 10. The ordinary income is received as payments are made from the annuity. Therefore, it may be desirable to spread out the tax impact over a period of years to the extent allowed by the distribution rules described previously.

As a result of these rules, it can be seen that the inside buildup in deferred annuities will always be taxed as ordinary income at some point: on receiving periodic income, on surrender of the contract, as partial distributions, as loans, upon gift of the contract, or at death. Also, except for death, tax on the buildup cannot be shifted to someone else.

**Penalty Tax on Premature Distributions** For nonqualified annuity contracts issued after January 18, 1985, any taxable amount withdrawn prior to age 59½ generally will be subject to the 10 percent excise tax on premature distributions. There are, however, certain exceptions as described earlier in this chapter.

### **Federal Estate Taxation**

The total death benefit of a deferred annuity will be included in the deceased owner's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. However, the beneficiary gets an income tax deduction for any federal estate tax paid by the decedent's estate that is attributable to this IRD item.

# **Other Individual Annuity Arrangements Charitable Gift Annuities**

These are part charitable contribution and part annuity arrangements provided by some charities. They are described in Chapter 19.

### **Using Life Insurance Values to Provide Retirement Income**

As explained in Chapter 21, most life insurance companies make available by contract, or as a matter of practice, settlement options for the policyowner as well as for death beneficiaries. Policyowners at or near retirement may choose to use some or all of their life insurance cash values in this way, assuming they feel they no longer need some or all of the life insurance protection. Life insurance cash values (or death proceeds) placed under such options are taxed under the general annuity rules of Section 72 of the IRC.

On the other hand, policyowners may choose not to surrender their policies, but to keep them in force while taking cash from them in other ways, as described in Chapters 21 and 29. Still another alternative is to keep life insurance fully in force to meet various needs. For example, it may be needed to provide protection for a surviving spouse or others.

Finally, life insurance contracts can be exchanged tax free for annuity contracts under Section 1035 of the IRC.
