# **Characteristics of Common Stocks**

*Common stock* may be defined as the residual ownership of a corporation that is entitled to all assets and earnings after other claims have been paid and that generally has voting control. In short, common stock is the fundamental ownership equity.

In modern asset allocation planning (see Chapter 9), it is recognized that common stocks as a group historically have provided superior total returns over reasonably long periods as compared with certain other investment media (e.g., bonds and Treasury bills). However, as noted in the preceding chapter, they also involve more risk in terms of volatility than these other asset classes. Therefore, common stocks are included in most investment portfolios for their superior returns, but other asset classes also may be included to reduce portfolio volatility and for diversification generally.

# **Stock Valuation Concepts**

In selecting common stocks for an investment portfolio, it obviously is important to understand the techniques and models that may be used to estimate the value of individual stocks. Such techniques and models are discussed in this section.

#### **Per-Share Data, Ratio Analysis, and Book Value**

Several basic calculations may serve as indicators of the worth of a common stock, including earnings per share, free cash flow per share, price-earnings ratio, price to free cash flow ratio, sales per share, price to sales ratio, priceearnings ratio divided by the stock's growth rate (P/EG), book value per share, liquidating value per share, and earnings yield, among others.

**Earnings Per Share** The traditional way to compute earnings per share (EPS) is to divide the income available to common shareholders (net corporate profits after taxes minus any preferred dividends) by the average number of common shares actually outstanding. This may be illustrated as follows.

Over the most recent 12 months in which it reported earnings, XYZ Company had a net profit of \$2,300,000 after deducting expenses, interest, taxes, and share-based compensation expenses. Preferred dividend requirements for the year were \$200,000. The remaining \$2,100,000 amounted to \$3 per share on the average 700,000 shares actually outstanding for the year (\$2,100,000 v 700,000 \$3). These are the company's *basic earnings per share.* Earnings per share are computed in the same way for quarterly or semiannual periods.

#### **Common Stocks 123**

Nonrecurring items (write-offs) contained in current income may or may not be excluded when computing earnings per share. When write-offs are excluded from the calculation, the earnings are called *operating earnings.* When they are included, the earnings are referred to as *reported earnings.*

The example just given is based on what are called *trailing earnings* because the earnings figure is for the most recent past actual earnings. However, sometimes analysts will estimate future earnings and base their calculations in whole or in part on these estimated (forward) earnings.

Corporations also report *diluted earnings per share*. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the average common shares actually outstanding plus the potential common shares that would be outstanding if the dilutive effect of employee stock options and other stock awards outstanding, convertible securities, and warrants were considered. Thus, the potential effect of these plans and securities (called *dilutive potential common shares*) on average outstanding common shares is taken into account by this adjustment. This can be significant, depending on the corporation. When discussing corporate earnings per share, analysts often use diluted earnings per share.

Starting in 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board requires corporations to recognize as an expense in their reported earnings the value of share-based compensation awards granted to their employees and directors. Such awards include employee stock options and employee stock purchases under an employee stock purchase plan (both discussed in Chapter 18). This is referred to as the "expensing of stock options." Such options usually are valued for this purpose by use of an option pricing model, such as Black-Scholes or some variation of it.

The impact of expensing stock options on reported earnings depends on the extent to which a firm uses stock-based compensation plans. It can have a significant impact in some cases. Analysts sometimes consider earnings without expensing stock options. This, of course, is a less conservative practice.

Investors and analysts generally place great emphasis on earnings per share and particularly on the trend of earnings per share in evaluating common stocks. It can be argued that a going business's value lies mainly in its potential earning power and that any present and future dividends depend on earnings. Thus, a stock's market price ultimately tends to keep pace with the growth or decline of its earnings per share.

**Free Cash Flow Per Share** Analysts also calculate a figure called *cash flow per share.* This is derived by adding back depreciation expense and possibly other noncash expenses to net profit minus preferred dividends and then dividing by the average number of common shares. The idea is to be able to better compare companies with varying depreciation policies. Other figures that

#### **124 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

some may use include *earnings before interest and taxes* (EBIT) (to adjust for differences in capital structures) and *earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization* (EBITDA) (to adjust for differences in capital structures and depreciation and amortization policies).

**Other Per-Share Data** A number of other per-share figures may also be found in analyses of common stocks. They may include sales per share, dividends per share, capital spending per share, research and development (R&D) costs per share, working capital per share, and cash per share.

**Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio** The price-earnings (P/E) ratio of a common stock is its market price divided by the current earnings per share of the corporation. Thus, if XYZ Company common stock is selling for \$42 per share at a time when its reported earnings over the latest 12 months amounted to \$3 per share, its P/E ratio (on a "trailing earnings" basis) would be 14 (\$42 v \$3). The priceearnings ratio is a commonly used measure of stock value because it gives an indication of stock price measured against the earning power of the stock.

An investor may find a review of past price-earnings ratios of a stock helpful in estimating its current value relative to the past. Assume, for example, that over a 10-year period, XYZ Company common stock has shown generally consistent growth in earnings per share and market price and that its P/E ratios have ranged from around 12 on the low side to 30 on the high side. Therefore, since this stock currently is selling for a price-earnings ratio of 14, that ratio is historically relatively low (perhaps because of a temporary reversal in the company's fortunes or a general market declineâ€“market risk), and thus the stock might be a good buy at this time. On the other hand, if XYZ common stock were selling for \$84, its P/E ratio (28) would be on the high side historically (perhaps because of excessive market exuberance). Of course, investors must consider other factors about the stock when making a final decision. For example, the past trend of a corporation's earnings per share is significant. The factors involved in fundamental analysis (security analysis) of common stocks are covered later in this chapter. Also, economic and stock market conditions and what those conditions are expected to be in the future naturally are important.

**P/EG Ratio** A variation of the price-earnings ratio is the P/EG ratio, which is the P/E ratio divided by the company's historical average annual profit growth. For example, if ABC Company's P/E ratio is 14 and its average annual rate of growth in per-share earnings for the last 10 years is 7 percent, its P/EG ratio would be 2 (14 P/E ratio v 7 2 P/EG). This number reflects the growth prospects of the company as well as the relationship between its stock price and current earnings. The P/EG ratio can be compared with other firms in its industry and analyzed over time.

**Other Ratios** Analysts use several other price ratios as well. For example, there is the stock's market price divided by its free cash flow. There also is sales per dollar of common stock market value, which is determined by dividing sales (revenue) by the average shares outstanding multiplied by the average stock price. Such sales ratios may be useful, for example, in evaluating companies in the developmental stage when they have no profits yet.

In terms of common stock yields, the *dividend yield* has already been described in Chapter 4. The *earnings yield* is the stock's earnings per share divided by the stock's market price.

**Net Asset Value (Book Value) Per Share** The net asset value per share, commonly referred to as the *book value* per share, attempts to measure the amount of net assets a corporation has for each share of common stock. It is calculated by taking the *net balance sheet values* of corporate assets, subtracting the face value of creditors' and preferred stockholders' claims, and dividing the remainder by the average number of outstanding common shares.

For example, XYZ Company at the end of its last fiscal year had total assets of \$33 million and debts and preferred stock totaling \$12 million. The remaining \$21 million indicated a net asset value (book value) of \$30 for each of its 700,000 common shares outstanding.

In most cases, book value per share is much less important than the ability of those assets to generate a stream of earnings. The market prices of common stocks of successful companies normally are several times the book value per share. On the other hand, for declining firms, market price may be less than book value. Overall, net asset value per share is not a very useful measure for evaluating the investment merits of a company's common stock. However, investors may measure the current market price level of a stock, an industry group, or the whole market in relation to past price levels by a measure often called *price to book* (market price per share divided by book value per share).

**Liquidating Value Per Share** This measure is determined by using the market or liquidating value of a corporation's assets rather than the balance sheet values (which generally are based on historical cost or market value, whichever is lower). Thus, this is the estimated amount that could be realized per share if the corporation's assets were sold off, its liabilities paid, and the balance distributed to the shareholders. It is not a going concern value, but rather a liquidation value after winding up the affairs of a business or venture. It also may be the starting point in arriving at discounts for gifts of closely held business interests.

#### **Common Stock Valuation Models**

In most cases, for corporations that are operating as profitable, going concerns are valued on the basis of their expected future earning power represented by future income (cash flow) or future dividends. This is an *income approach* to valuation. In the discussion that follows, the capitalized net earnings, discounted cash flow, and dividend discount models illustrate this approach to valuation.

In certain situations, however, other approaches to valuation may be useful. These include a *market approach* in which valuations are based on or analyzed in relation to the prices paid for, or price-earnings ratios, or P/EG ratios of comparable companies in the same industry. They also include a *cost or balance sheet approach* where valuations are based on or modified by the values of a company's assets and liabilities. In some cases, the break-up value or liquidated value of a company (as defined in the preceding section) may be significant. In a few industries, the price of a company's stock is greatly affected by the values of assets held by the companyâ€”such as gold mining companies, for example. Analysts may also note the amount of cash per share or other assets per share in evaluating a company.1

All these valuation approaches can be applied to publicly held corporations and private (closely held) corporations. Of course, the stock prices of publicly held corporations are determined daily by supply and demand for their shares on organized exchanges for all to see. Analysts value these stocks to determine their investment merits and to set price targets for them. The stocks of private corporations, on the other hand, are not publicly traded, so their prices are not determined regularly by market action. However, their values must be determined from time to time for various purposes, such as for the sale or merger of the company, to set prices in buyâ€“sell agreements, for values in employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) and phantom stock plans, for giving to family members, and at the death of an owner for estate tax and other purposes, among others. These values normally are estimated by business valuation experts. Planning for closely held corporations is considered in detail in Chapter 31.

Various theoretical models have been developed to value common stocks on the basis of their earnings or dividends (an income approach) and some will be discussed next.

**Capitalized Earnings (Net Income) Model** This approach discounts the expected future earnings (net income) of a corporation for the indefinite

<sup>1</sup> In general, these valuation techniques also can be used for other types of business entities, such as partnerships and limited liability companies (LLCs) as discussed in Chapter 31.

future at a discount rate which reflects the rate of return investors expect to receive from this kind of stock (required return). Assuming the corporation's earnings are expected to grow at a generally constant rate into the future, the formula for such a constant growth model can be expressed as:

$$V = \frac{E}{r - g}$$

where

 $V =$  the value of the stock (sometimes called the "intrinsic value" or "true value")

 $E =$  the current year's net income (or cash flow)

 $r =$  the discount rate, which is the rate of return investors require for the kind of stock being valued

 $g =$  the assumed growth rate in the stock's net income (or cash flow)

As an example, suppose Close Corporation is a private (closely held) company owned equally by three unrelated stockholders: Harry, Ann, and Walter. They are negotiating a buy-sell agreement among the three owners so that when one of them dies, the two survivors can purchase his or her stock from the deceased's estate for a fair value as determined in the agreement. Their advisers and a business valuation expert have recommended that they use a capitalized net earnings valuation formula in the agreement and assume a discount rate of 25 percent (for the risk involved in a small, closely held company) and an average annual growth rate of 5 percent.

Assume further that at the death of one of the owners, the Corporation's current year's net income (possibly with some adjustments) is \$1,200,000. Given these facts, the value of Close Corporation as a whole using the capitalized earnings approach would be:

$$V = \frac{\$1,200,000}{0.25 - 0.05}$$
  
=  $\frac{\$1,200,000}{0.20} = \$6,000,000$  (or 2,000,000 for the decendants 1/3 share)

It may be noted that the same result occurs in this case when the annual earnings are multiplied by 5 (or  $1 \div 0.20 = 5$ ).

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model** In this case, the analyst makes a year-byyear forecast of a corporation's net income or cash flow for a certain period in the future, say, five to seven years. The forecast income in each of these years

can vary during this period. Each of these figures is then discounted back to its current present value. Then, at the end of the period a "terminal value" (capitalized earnings value) is calculated on the assumption that the corporation's income will grow at a constant rate from then on for the indefinite future. This terminal value is also discounted back to the present. The sum of these present values then is the estimated fair market value of the corporation under the DCF model. This may also be referred to as a multiple-growth model.

**Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)** This model discounts at an appropriate rate (the rate of return required by investors for the kind of stock involved) the expected future stream of dividends from a stock. The present value of this infinite stream of dividends is the estimated fair market value of the stock (intrinsic value). The rationale for using dividends in this model is that dividends represent the cash flow that stockholders receive from their investments in common stocks

A stock could have a constant stream of dividends, such as from preferred stock; however, investors normally expect the dividends on common stocks to increase over time (a dividend growth model). The formula for a *constant* growth dividend discount model is:

$$V = \frac{D(1+g)}{r-g}$$

where

 $V$  = value of the stock (intrinsic value)

 $D =$  the current year's dividend

 $r =$  the discount rate required by investors

 $g =$  the assumed growth rate of the stock's dividends (normally based on past experience)

For example, assume an investor is considering buying Acme Corporation common stock with a current annual dividend of \$2 per share, and for the last 20 years, this dividend has been increased at an average annual rate of 6 percent and the investor expects it will continue to do so in the future. The investor also expects a 10 percent rate of return from Acme stock. Given these facts, the constant-growth DDM would produce the following estimated fair market value for Acme common stock.

$$V = \frac{2(1+0.06)}{0.10-0.06}$$
$$= \frac{2.12}{0.04} = $53 \text{ per share}$$

If the actual market price for the stock is less than \$53 per share, the model suggests it is undervalued by the market. On the other hand, if the market price is greater than \$53, theoretically the stock is overvalued.

**Developing the Discount Rate** In utilizing the models just discussed, it is clear that many estimates and forecasts are necessary. Some of them are for many years in the future.

One important estimate is the discount rate (in the preceding formulas), which is the rate of return investors are assumed to require for the kind of stock being valued. As the divisor in the preceding formulas, it has a great impact on the values produced (as do estimates of future earnings or dividends). The discount rate used by analysts often is composed of several elements (a so-called build-up approach). These elements may include the risk-free rate (often the U.S. Treasury bill rate) to reflect the time value of money, the equity risk premium (defined in Chapter 4) to reflect the risk structure of common stocks, and additional adjustments to reflect the risk characteristics of the particular stock (like an additional rate for smaller closely held stocks).

**Price-Earnings Ratio Models** A number of analysts calculate an estimated value for a stock by multiplying its current year's earnings per share times an estimated, hypothetical or "normal" price-earnings (P/E) ratio. This estimated value then can be compared with the stock's actual market price per share to see if the stock is undervalued, appropriately valued, or overvalued in the market relative to the estimated value. Of course, much depends on the accuracy of the analyst's estimate of the "normal" P/E ratio for the stock.

# **Portfolio Development and Analysis (The Investment Process)**

Successful investing in common stocks cannot be based on hunch, hope, or rumor (tips). It is founded on studying the economy and then studying industries and particular companies.

# **Fundamental Analysis**

Fundamental analysis involves selecting stocks based on the many variables that will affect the fortunes of particular companies. It considers both external and company-specific factors that will influence the profitability and, hence, the investment value of companies. As noted earlier, however, the whole concept of fundamental analysis and security selection is called into question by the efficient market hypothesis, depending on which form of this hypothesis one is considering. However, the efficient market hypothesis itself is controversial, and many investors and their advisers believe in fundamental security analysis. Fundamental analysis, of course, involves active investment management as opposed to passive investing, such as through index funds.

Fundamental analysis begins with an evaluation of the general economy, then an analysis of the industries in which the companies being considered are operating, and finally a study of the particular company or companies being evaluated. This approach is referred to as *top-down analysis.*

**Consider the Economy** Chapter 2 dealt with the economic climate for wealth management. Naturally, the economy is a key element in investment planning in general and security selection in particular. The business cycle is especially significant in this regard. Stock prices decline during recessions and depressions (see Table 5.2 for some significant stock market declines during bear markets). They then recover and move higher during the prosperity phase. In general, however, stock prices tend to precede turns in the business cycle by about 11 months, on average, since the end of World War II. That is, they begin declining before the economy itself turns down and begin advancing before the economy starts to recover. Thus, they tend to be a leading economic indicator.

However, as noted in Chapter 2, forecasting the business cycle and bull and bear stock markets is very difficult, if not impossible. Many believe that most investors cannot successfully engage in such market timing. Therefore, investors may follow a buy-and-hold strategy for long-term investing over the various phases of the business cycle.

On the other hand, asset allocation and security selection normally will be different in the face of recession or depression than during prosperity. Asset allocations will shift more toward bonds and cash equivalents. Security selection will become more conservative and perhaps shift toward a defensive stock approach. More attention may be paid to the financial soundness (credit quality) and balance sheet values of companies during hard times. In fact, the basic premises of present-day value investing (discussed later in this chapter) were articulated in 1934 during the Great Depression by legendary investors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in their seminal book *Security Analysis: Principles and Techniques* (McGraw-Hill, Inc.).

Such analysis of financial soundness will involve attention to various liquidity ratios. These may include the *current ratio* (current assets divided by current liabilities), the *quick ratio* (current assets minus inventory divided by current liabilities), and the *cash ratio* (cash items divided by current liabilities). Debt ratios are also significant. Some examples are the *coverage of senior charges* (pretax earned income divided by senior charges) and *debt service coverage* (after-tax cash flow from operations divided by interest, rent, current maturities, and sinking fund payments). The ratio of a corporation's debt to its capital (debt divided by assets minus liabilities) also is often cited.

**Consider the Industry** The next step is evaluating the industry or industries involved. The following are some questions to consider in doing so:

- N Does the industry provide products or services for which demand is substantial and growing?
- N Is the industry cyclical or relatively stable?
- N Is the industry likely to be affected by new developments?
- N Is the industry growing rapidly, growing at a more stable rate, or perhaps declining relative to other industries?
- N Is the industry subject to rapid technological change or development?

**Analyze the Company** The characteristics to look for depend largely on the common stock investment strategy being followed. Some investors are looking for short-term speculations. Others want turnaround situations or are following the depressed-industry approach. Still others may be investing primarily for income. A large group of investors, however, are looking for good quality, financially strong, and profitable companies that they believe are temporarily undervalued by the market relative to the company's intrinsic (or fundamental) value. These are *value investors*. On the other hand, many other investors are looking for strong, high-quality companies with above-average growth prospects over a reasonably long period. They are generally following a buy-and-hold growth stock approach. Given which kind of philosophy is involved, the following are some characteristics that investors might consider in selecting common stocks:

- N The company should have good, stable management.
- N The company should provide good products or services that have strong competitive positions in their industry.
- N The company should be reasonably diversified and not largely dependent on only one product or patent.
- N The company should have had consistent earnings growth over a reasonable period, such as the last 10 years. This does not mean the company cannot have had declines in earnings for one or two years, but they should be exceptions and the trend should be decidedly upward (particularly for growth stocks).
- N The previous characteristic can be quantified by saying there should be an average annual compound rate of growth in earnings per share over the period being considered of at least a certain figure, such as ranging from 15 to 20 percent (particularly for growth stocks).

#### **132 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

- N As far as can be determined, the company should have good prospects for growth of earnings in the future.
- N The company should have a good return on equity over a period of years.
- N The company should have a strong financial position.
- N Depending on the industry, companies usually should be devoting reasonable resources to research and development (particularly for growth stocks).
- N Investors who want current dividend income should consider the stock's current dividend yield and past record of dividend increases or decreases.
- N Finally, the stock's purchase price should be reasonable. The "reasonableness" of a common stock's price is often measured in terms of its P/E ratio (or perhaps in terms of one of the valuation models described previously). This is especially pertinent for value investors who are looking for stocks they believe are temporarily undervalued by the market.

As a practical matter, it is difficult for most individual investors to research and analyze personally such factors as industry characteristics, competitive positions of companies, and the investment characteristics of a given company. However, various professional investment services, stockbrokers, and investment advisers are in a position to do such research, and this type of investigation frequently is available to individual investors. Investors should make it a practice not to buy a stock unless they have determined its fundamental position from such sources or perhaps from their own research.

## **Technical Analysis**

As opposed to fundamental analysis, technical analysis attempts to predict changes in stock prices, up or down, based on movements or activity of the price or trading volume of a stock itself or of the stock market generally. It can focus on a particular stock or stocks or on the aggregate market. The concept is that the market itself is the best predictor of its future course because there are recurrent movements in stock prices. It is a market timing philosophy and attempts to predict stock price movements and then buy or sell accordingly.

A number of techniques are used in technical analysis. One is *charting*, in which records of past stock prices are analyzed. For example, high and low prices of a stock for each day may be studied to determine its "momentum." Other charting techniques employ so-called point-and-figure charts. In other cases, the structure of the market itself may be studied to determine future trends. The Dow theory is the genesis of most technical analysis. Its originator was Charles Dow, who established *The Wall Street Journal* and is the *Dow* of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It seeks to predict long-term trends in stock prices by studying peaks and troughs in the market averages.

#### **Common Stocks 133**

Other techniques involve *flow of funds indications.* One example would be studying volumes of stock trading and comparing the average volume of declining issues to the average volume of advancing issues. Another possibility would be sentiment indications, such as the analysis of insider trading activity.

# **Diversifying a Common Stock Portfolio**

Assuming an investor wants to hold stocks directly, investment diversification does not mean that he or she should arbitrarily buy stock in a large number of companies. Investors normally should not own stock directly in more companies than they or their investment advisers can reasonably follow. It probably would be sensible to put the investor's directly owned common stock allocation into, say, 10 to 15 individually owned stocks. Of course, diversification can also be secured by investing through financial intermediaries.

# **Decisions Concerning Selling Common Stocks**

Although much of the emphasis concerning common stock investment has been on buying, the question of when to sell also is important. There may be many reasons for selling stocks. One is the need for cash. Another is to take a profit (or reduce a loss) when an investor thinks a stock, or the market as a whole, has reached an upper limit. Or, investors may sell if they believe other stocks will perform better or their money can earn a higher rate of return if invested elsewhere. Furthermore, an important reason to sell may be that the investor's portfolio is too heavily concentrated in one or a few stocks.

It should be remembered, however, that there are transfer costs (i.e., brokerage commissions) and capital gains taxes on any profits when a stock is sold. This means the attractiveness of any alternative investment must, over time, outweigh the costs of selling.

# **Dollar-Cost Averaging**

One diversification technique for long-term common stock investing is dollar-cost averaging. This is the investment of a certain sum of money at regular intervals in the same stock or stocks or the same investment intermediary. The method normally results in a lower average cost per share than the average market price per share during the period in question, because the investor buys more shares with the periodic fixed amount of money when the stock is low in price than when it is high. Then, when the stock rises again (if it does), the investor shows a profit on the greater number of shares

purchased at the lower prices. Table 5.1 shows how the principle of dollarcost averaging could work.

Dollar-cost averaging frequently works, unless the stock goes into a persistent decline. However, it takes a certain strength of conviction. The investor must be convinced that, whatever happens from time to time, the stock or investment intermediary is a good long-term investment.

# **Types of Orders in Buying and Selling Common Stocks**

Various kinds of buy and sell orders may be used in common stock transactions. The most common is the *market order,* which is an order to buy or sell securities at the best price obtainable in the market now. It is expressed to the broker as an order to buy or sell *at the market.* For many stock transactions, a market order is reasonable.

However, when market prices are uncertain or are fluctuating rapidly, it may be better for an investor to enter a *limit order* that specifies the maximum price the investor is willing to pay or, if selling, the minimum price the investor is willing to accept.

Most types of orders include a time reference. *Open orders* are good until canceled. Another type is the *day order,* which is good only for the day on which it is ordered.

Another common type of order is a *stop-loss order.* It is generally used to sell a stock once its price reaches a certain point, usually below the current market price. As an example, suppose a stock's current price is \$100 and the investor feels the stock market is so uncertain that the price of the stock could

#### **Common Stocks 135**

fluctuate markedly in either direction. To minimize potential loss from the \$100 level, the investor might enter a stop order at, say, \$90. If the market price declines, the stock will be sold if the market price reaches \$90. A stoploss order becomes a market order once the specified price is reached, and the stock will be sold immediately at whatever price the broker can secure. Of course, if the market price goes up or never declines to the stop-loss price, the investor would have lost nothing by placing the order.

An investor who wishes to use a stop-loss order only at a specific price would enter a *stop limit order.* In the preceding illustration, this order would instruct the broker to sell only at \$90. If the transaction cannot be executed at \$90, it will not be executed at all.

# **Margin Accounts**

Investors may open *cash accounts* with their brokerage firms. As the name implies, all transactions are for the full amount of the trade in cash. That is, a \$10,000 trade requires a \$10,000 cash settlement within three full business days after the trade is made.

A *margin account* allows investors to put up some of their own money and borrow the remainder. Margin accounts for listed securities can be opened through either a brokerage house or a commercial bank. The minimum down payment, or *margin requirement,* is set by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve system.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose the margin requirement is 50 percent and Mr. Baker buys 100 shares of ABC Corporation common stock at \$70 per share. If this is a margin trade, he is required to come up with only \$3,500 in cash (or its equivalent in other securities). He then borrows the rest (\$3,500) from a bank or broker at the interest rate for this type of loan. Margin interest rates charged by different brokers can vary considerably and they often are less for larger loan balances. The entire \$7,000 worth of securities is then put up as collateral for the \$3,500 loan. Federal Reserve requirements specify only the *initial margin,* the minimum margin required at the time a loan is made.

But if the price of ABC common stock declines so that Mr. Baker's equity in the account decreases, he may get a maintenance margin call. *Maintenance margin* is the minimum equity position investors can have in their accounts before they are asked to put up additional funds. In this illustration, for example, assuming maintenance margin is 30 percent, ABC common

#### **136 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

could fall to a price as low as 50 without a margin call.2 It can be seen that by borrowing to buy securities, investors stand a chance of magnifying their losses, just as they do of magnifying their gains. Thus, it is a more risky (aggressive) investment strategy.

# **Selling Short**

*Selling short* means selling securities that the investor either does not possess, and therefore must borrow to settle the account, or does possess but does not wish to deliver.3 The former is the typical short sale when an investor expects the stock to decline in price. The latter is called *selling short against the box*, and formerly was often used to lock in a profit on a stock and postpone paying taxes on the capital gain. However, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 eliminated the selling-short-against-the-box technique for this purpose, except in limited circumstances. (The planning techniques for deferring or avoiding capital gains are covered in Chapter 11.)

The reason for selling short is that the investor anticipates a declining market price for the security. A typical example would be selling today at 100 with the hope of covering the sale, say, a year from now, at a lower price, for example, 70 or less. Covering involves buying securities to replace the borrowed ones. Of course, the reverse may occur and the price of the stock may not declineâ€”it may rise, thereby making it necessary to buy the stock later at a higher price than that at which it was sold. Short sellers also must pay the equivalent of any dividends payable on the borrowed stock to the owner. Selling short is normally considered an aggressive investment policy.

# **Investment Categories of Common Stock**

Securities firms and investment analysts use many different categories to classify the investment characteristics of common stocks. The basic categories used here are (1) growth, (2) value, (3) income, (4) growth (moderate) and income, (5) defensive, (6) cyclical, (7) blue chip, (8) speculative, (9) special situations,

<sup>2</sup> Since Mr. Baker must maintain an equity position of 30 percent in his margin account, he can borrow up to 70 percent of the value of the securities. His present loan is \$3,500. Therefore, \$3,500 divided by 0.70 (70 percent) equals the minimum value of securities Mr. Baker can have in his margin account without having to add more margin (cash or securities). In this case, the amount is \$5,000 (\$3,500 v 0.70), or \$50 per share.

<sup>3</sup> In the common parlance of transactions, when investors buy a security they hope eventually to sell at a higher price, they have assumed what is called a long position. When the order of these transactions is reversedâ€”sell first and hope to cover the sale later by buying at a lower priceâ€”the investor has taken a short position.

(10) small and medium-sized companies, and (11) foreign. It should be recognized that these categories are not mutually exclusive.

# **Growth Stocks**

The term *growth stock* is hard to define, but such a stock is usually considered from a company whose sales and earnings are expanding faster than the general economy and faster than those of most stocks. The company usually is well managed, is research- or innovation-oriented, and plows back most or all of its earnings into the company for future expansion. For this reason, growth companies often pay no or relatively small dividends. Over time, however, investors hope that substantial capital gains will accrue from the appreciation of the value of their stock. The market price of growth stocks can be volatile. They often go up faster than other stocks, but at the first hint that the rate of increase in their earnings is not being sustained or that they will not meet the expectations of investors or analysts, their prices can come down rapidly.

## **Value Stocks**

As noted earlier, these typically are stocks of established, well-managed companies with strong balance sheets that are temporarily undervalued by the stock market. Thus, their market prices are temporarily below their so-called intrinsic value, based on their fundamental economic value. They usually pay reasonable dividends and have a good current yield.

## **Income Stocks**

Sometimes people buy common stocks for current income. Stocks may be classified as *income stocks* when they pay a higher-than-average current yield. When general economic conditions become uncertain, investors often become more interested in current dividend income from stocks.

## **Growth (Moderate) and Income Stocks**

These stocks pay reasonable dividends and offer reasonable growth potential.

# **Defensive Stocks**

Some stocks are characterized as *defensive.* Such stocks are regarded as stable and comparatively safe, especially in periods of declining business activity. Their products tend to be staples and thus may suffer relatively little during recessions or depressions. The shares of utilities and food companies are examples of defensive issues.

# **Cyclical Stocks**

Considerably different from defensive stocks are cyclical stocks. A *cyclical company* is one whose earnings and share price tend to fluctuate sharply with the business cycle or with a cycle peculiar to its own industry. Automobile manufacturers, machine tool companies, and property and liability insurers have been examples of cyclical companies.

## **Blue-Chip Stocks**

*Blue-chip* stocks generally are considered high-grade, investment-quality issues of major, well-established companies that have long records of earnings stability or growth and dividend payments in good times as well as bad. *Blue chip* is a rather vague term that is not very helpful in investment analysis.

## **Speculative Stocks**

Speculative stocks are those presenting far greater risks for the investor than common stocks generally. Some high-flying glamour stocks are speculative. Likewise, some hot new issues and penny mining stocks are speculative. Other types can be identified from time to time as they come and go. Some are easy to identify; others are more difficult.

Also, there usually comes a point in a bull market when small, hitherto unknown companies go public or new small companies are formed. The public offering of their shares may find a fierce speculative demand, and their prices often rise precipitously. Unfortunately, a day of reckoning usually follows.

## **Special Situations**

There are stocks that may show rapid price appreciation due to some special and unique development that will affect the company positively. There might be a new process or invention, a natural resource discovery, a new product, a dramatic management change, a turnaround situation, and so forth. Companies normally in other categories can become a special situation in the face of such a development.

### **Small and Midsize Company Stocks**

As the name indicates, small and midsize company stocks are stocks of smaller corporationsâ€”sometimes called *small-cap* or *mid-cap* (market capitalization) stocks. Some studies of stock returns over relatively long periods have shown that, on average, the performance of small company stocks has been better than that of their larger counterparts but with greater volatility.

# **Foreign Stocks**

Americans can buy the stocks of foreign companies through American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). An ADR is a negotiable U.S. certificate representing ownership of shares in a foreign corporation. ADRs are quoted and traded in U.S. dollars on markets in the United States, and associated dividends are paid to investors in U.S. dollars. ADRs were created to make it easier for U.S. investors to buy, hold, and sell foreign stocks.

The shares of some foreign companies may be traded on U.S. stock exchanges and can be purchased directly by U.S. investors. Also, larger stockbrokers can purchase shares of foreign companies on foreign exchanges for their U.S. customers.

# **Some Theories of Common Stock Investment**

There are many theories of how to invest in common stocks. They tend to rise and fall in popularity, depending on market and economic conditions. Clearly, there is no agreement on any one theory. Some examples of such theories follow. This listing of theories is not meant to be exhaustive; others could be given.

In structuring the common stock portion of an investor's asset allocation, he or she (or his or her adviser) may primarily want to follow one of these theories, such as value investing or growth investing. However, many investors may want to diversify their stock holdings among several categories of common stocks, such as some growth stocks or funds and some defensive stocks or funds.

# **Growth Theory**

The growth theory has been popular. This theory advocates analysis of corporate and industry data to select those quality issues that show continuing growth from one business cycle to another and a growth rate that well exceeds that of the overall economy. Implicit in this theory is that the investor is seeking returns primarily in the form of capital growth rather than dividend income.

Another approach for the growth theory investor is to purchase mutual funds (or accounts through other financial intermediaries) that specialize in certain industries the investor considers growth industries or in funds with growth or aggressive growth as investment objectives. This way, the investor gets (and pays for) professional management in selecting growth stocks.

## **Value Investing**

The value investing theory also is popular. It generally calls for investing in the stocks of good-quality companies that have strong balance sheets and whose stocks appear to be temporarily undervalued by the stock market. This undervaluation often results from some temporary setback for the company or its industry. This theory requires careful security analysis and considerable patience. Value investors also argue that their theory involves lower market risk because the stocks they consider are already selling at low prices relative to other stocks.

As noted earlier, the value investing approach was popularized by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in their classic work, *Security Analysis: Principles and Techniques,* originally published in 1934. The Graham and Dodd book, with its subsequent editions, has influenced value theory investors to this day.

## **Moderately Growing Industries and Income Approach**

Other investors prefer a policy of purchasing common stocks of good-quality companies that pay reasonable dividends and have prospects for at least some growth.

# **Depressed-Industry Approach**

Almost the opposite of the growth stock theory is the depressed-industry approach, where the investor endeavors to select comeback industries and companies. As of this writing, shares of companies in the U.S. auto industry may be an example of this approach.

# **The Case for Long-Term Investments in Common Stocks**

To many people, *investment* has almost come to mean buying common stocks. There are several historical reasons for this. First is the long-term general decrease in the purchasing power of the dollar (inflation). Second, generally rising stock markets during much of the 1950s and 1960s, and particularly during the later 1980s and the 1990s, provided substantial (and sometimes spectacular) capital gains for many people who were in the market.

#### **Studies of Historical Returns**

The case for long-term investment in a diversified portfolio of common stocks as the best way to accumulate wealth is often based on a number of studies comparing past total returns from common stocks with those from certain other asset classes. These studies have found that the average annual compound rates of total return for large groups of common stocks were considerably higher than the corresponding rates of total return for long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. Treasury bills, and gold over certain long periods. However, they also show that common stocks (and particularly U.S. small stocks) display much greater volatility (i.e., standard deviations) than these other asset classes. An excellent exposition of this thesis is contained in the book, *Stocks for the Long Run* by Jeremy J. Siegel.4

A number of other studies have reached the same general conclusions. They include the 1964 study by Lawrence Fisher and James H. Lorie that contained rates of return for all common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange for 22 periods between January 1926 and December 1960.5

Another important study along the same lines was that of Roger G. Ibbotson and Rex A. Sinquefield in 1976.6 The average annual rates of return and standard deviations for common stocks and other investment media, along with other statistical data, are updated annually by Ibbotson and Associates.7 These data are widely used in the securities and mutual fund industries and by financial commentators generally. They are sometimes referred to as Ibbotson yields. The Center for Research of Security Prices at the University of Chicago also makes available online similar data. There have been other studies as well.8

#### **Some Conclusions Regarding the Studies**

These studies have shown that average annual total rates of return and standard deviations have varied considerably among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, U.S. Treasury bills, gold, and so forth) and have varied over different periods. But what they also universally show is that over relatively long periods diversified portfolios of common stocks have performed

significantly better than the other investment media studied (mainly U.S. Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury bills).

As an example, consider the period 1926 through 2005. This (or perhaps a period with a somewhat earlier starting year) is widely cited because it is of long duration, covers all kinds of economic conditions (prosperity, depression, and recession), and includes long periods of peace but also several times of war. During this period, the average annual arithmetic total return for U.S. large-cap common stocks was 12.15 percent, while the comparable return for long-term U.S. Treasury bonds was 5.68 percent. However, the risk factor (volatility) for common stocks for this period, as measured by the standard deviation of yearly returns, was also significantly higher for common stocks than for bonds. The standard deviation for these stocks for this period was 20.26, while for bonds it was 8.09.9

This means that although a diversified portfolio of common stocks can be expected to perform much better over a relatively long period than a portfolio of investment-grade bonds, the price of this better return is greater volatility of results from year to year and, therefore, higher risk.

These studies of historical returns have had a profound impact on investment thinking. They have helped make common stocks the preferred investment medium for many investors and their advisers. While the studies are based on historical data and there is no guarantee that the results shown will be repeated over long periods in the future, the consistency of the studies' results, the careful research that has gone into them, and the characteristics and variety of the long periods covered by the studies make them quite persuasive. It is hard to argue with the facts. After all, as the saying goes, "Those who do not learn from the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them."

These studies, which we shall refer to as the *historical yield approach,* relate particularly to asset allocation decisions. They may encourage investors to allocate as large a percentage of their investable assets as possible (given their time frames, tolerance for risk [volatility], and other considerations) to common stocks for the long term. This is discussed further in Chapter 9. Our tax system also tends to favor common stock investment over the long run.

#### **Some Caveats**

While the case just presented for a diversified portfolio (or index) of common stocks for superior long-term returns is persuasive, caveats always apply to any planning strategy. The firstâ€”that there is no guarantee history will repeat itselfâ€”has already been discussed.

<sup>9</sup> See Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, and Alan J. Marcus, *Investments*, 7th Edition (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2008), p. 146.

#### **Need for Diversified Long-Term Approach**

The second is that the studies have been done using large numbers of stocks (e.g., all stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the S&P 500, and so forth) and therefore would seem to be valid only if an investor has a reasonably diversified portfolio of common stocks. A portfolio heavily weighted in only one or a few stocks may not perform like the general averages.

Third, the studies' results are obtained only for relatively long holding periods. Thus, an investor should be prepared to hold a consistent stock position over a relatively long time, which may include bad times as well as good. However, this historical yield approach does not seem to imply that a reasonably diversified portfolio cannot be actively managed by selling some stocks and buying others.

#### **Need to Be Aware of Bear Markets**

Fourth, it must be recognized that over the periods being analyzed, there have been significant bear markets for common stocks. A bear market may be defined as a reasonably long period during which common stocks in general consistently decline by a significant amount. What amount is "significant" can be a matter of opinion, but many consider it a bear market when the decline is 20 percent or more over a period of six months or longer.10

We noted earlier the concept of degree of risk based on the standard deviation of yearly returns over a given period. However, since we are looking at history, a number of bear markets in stocks have lasted longer than a year. Investors must deal with actual, possibly sustained stock market declines, rather than just with statistical yearly deviations from the average.

Therefore, it will be fruitful in evaluating the possibility and extent of declines in a stock portfolio to look at some past bear markets in common stocks. Table 5.2 presents selected actual bear markets based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, except where indicated. It starts with the famous (or infamous) Great Depression of the 1930s and then moves to postâ€“World War II bear markets. Finally, it looks at the decline in the Japanese stock market (the Nikkei 225) for some international perspective.

These data may be useful in helping to estimate how large a potential stock market decline investors need to be prepared for in investment planning. It would be splendid, of course, if one could forecast when bear markets were coming and what the bottom was going to be and then sell high and buy low.

<sup>10</sup>Another term sometimes used in this respect is a market correction. In general, a market correction is not as severe as a bear market and is a sudden, sharp decline in stock prices of at least 10 percent that lasts a shorter time (such as a few days or weeks).

**Table 5.2.** Significant Stock Market Declines\* (Bear Markets)

\*These data are based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, except where indicated.

\*\*These recovery periods are based on stock prices only. They would be shorter if dividends paid on common stocks were considered. Dividends were not considered because interest or other income could have been earned on the funds had they not been placed in stocks.

Unfortunately, like the weather, everyone talks about bear markets but no one does anything about them. No one really knows when bear markets will occur and how severe they will be. However, it seems only prudent to assume that they will occur periodically, as they have in the past.

So the difficult question is how large a stock market decline should an investor plan for. As just admitted, no one really knows. However, history has helped us estimate long-term stock market returns, so it can give us some clues here as well. We previously noted that based on the lengthy period of 1926 through 2005, we have 95 percent confidence that common stocks will not decline more than about 20 percent from their expected return in any one year (the standard deviation). However, we also have seen from Table 5.2 that bear markets often have lasted longer than one year. Considering only postâ€“World War II U.S. stock market declines, the most severe percentage declines so far have been about 45 percent during the 23 months between January 1973 and December 1974 and the current decline that began in October 2007. Therefore, to take a worst-case postâ€“World War II kind of scenario for the U.S. market, we might assume just for planning purposes that common stocks could fall somewhere between 40 and 50 percent during a given bear market. However, given the lessons of the Great Depression of the 1930s (when common stocks declined about 89 percent and did not recover to their previous high for 25 years) and the current Japanese decline, it seems only prudent to be even more cautious in the current economic environment. How severe and how long the bear market existing as of this writing will be no one knows. However, for planning purposes (and in our asset allocation decision making) we might assume a potential decline of as much as 60â€“75 percent. This in no way means common stocks should be avoided in a portfolio. It just gives a benchmark to test for how much of a decline an investor can tolerate in his or her portfolio in asset allocation planning.

Before ending the discussion of bear markets, it should be noted that there also have been bear markets in asset classes other than common stocks. This has been true of bonds (particularly during the late 1970s and the 1980s) and real estate (particularly in the late 1980s, early 1990s, and at present).
