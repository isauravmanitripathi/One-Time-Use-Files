Insurance provides an important means of meeting the financial objectives of most people. This chapter deals with some important concepts about the nature of insurance and the evaluation and selection of insurance companies.

## **Personal Risk Management**

The term *risk management* normally means identifying risk exposures and consideration of alternative methods for dealing with risk. Business firms commonly use this approach in managing their exposures to risk. It also can be used by individuals in managing their personal exposures, in which case, it sometimes is called *personal risk management.* 

The logical start of any risk management program is the recognition of one's exposures. This may not be as easy as it seems. For example, if a person hires a domestic worker in his or her home, what liability for worker's compensation or employment practices liability may exist? If the person serves on the board of directors or trustees of a corporation or local organization, could he or she be personally liable for actions taken by the organization under directors' and officers' liability? What about a person's potential liability for libel, slander, invasion of privacy, and other "intentional" torts? What about any business or professional liability exposure a person may have? These and other personal risk exposures should be identified and evaluated in personal risk management.

The basic risk management techniques are avoidance of risk, loss prevention and reduction (loss control), retention (planned assumption) of risk, and transfer of risk. *Insurance* is the most important transfer device. Part VII of the book discusses the various kinds of insurance that can be used for this purpose.

## **Basic Insurance Principles Pooling of Exposures**

Not all risks are insurable. However, many potentially serious events can be insured against by transferring them through insurance contracts to insurers who combine the risks of many so that accurate insurance premiums can be calculated and applied. This results from the law of large numbers as noted in Chapter 2. In essence, insurance is a means of eliminating or reducing the financial burden of such events by dividing the losses they produce among many individuals or firms exposed to the events. This is the concept of *pooling,* which lies at the heart of insurance.

#### **Large-Loss Principle**

Another basic principle is that in buying insurance, the buyer should place primary emphasis on those risks that potentially could wipe out or substantially deplete the person's or family's net worth. This sometimes is called the *large-loss principle.* Note that the severity of a potential loss, not its frequency, should be the determining factor.

#### **Use of Deductibles and Other Cost-Sharing Devices**

Whenever feasible, use of deductibles should be considered in insurance planning. A deductible requires the insured to pay the first portion, such as the first \$500, of a covered loss before the insurance comes into play. An elimination (or waiting) period used in some forms of insurance has the same effect. Use of deductibles often benefits the insured because they normally make insurance considerably less expensive. Deductibles eliminate small losses and, hence, the disproportionately high administrative expenses of settling such claims.

## **Considerations in Choosing an Insurer**

Selection of insurers is one of the practical problems faced in buying insurance. In some cases, this problem may be resolved either by the selection of an agent or broker, who then determines the insurer to be used, or by the use of insurance-buying facilities (such as the Internet). However, despite these factors, insureds should take responsibility for selecting sound insurers. Also, wealth management professionals should take care to exercise due diligence in this important area, particularly considering the economic environment existing as of this writing.

It should be noted at the outset that no generalization should be made concerning choice of a particular insurer solely on the basis of its legal form of organization—that is, whether the insurer is a stock company, a mutual company, or a reciprocal, as described in Chapter 2. Instead, an insurer should be evaluated on such grounds as its financial soundness, the extent and quality of the service it renders, the types of coverage and policies the insurer offers, and the price it charges for a particular coverage.

#### **Financial Soundness**

**General Considerations** The financial soundness of an insurer is of paramount importance to potential insureds and their wealth management advisers. Unfortunately, it may be difficult for the average person to assess the financial status of an insurer.

Buyers of insurance may receive some assurance about the strength and stability of insurers through the regulatory procedures of the various states. While the financial requirements that insurers must meet vary among the states, there nevertheless may be some indication that an insurer is stable and financially sound if it is authorized to sell insurance in states with effective insurance regulation. People often cite the state of New York as an example in this regard.

**Financial Ratings of Insurers** Perhaps the most widely used and readily available measure of financial soundness or claims-paying ability of insurance companies is the financial ratings given to many insurance companies, particularly the larger ones, by several independent insurance rating services. While there are several such services, some of the most widely followed are A.M. Best, Moody's, and Standard & Poor's. Two other frequently mentioned services are Fitch and Weiss Research. Each of these services differs at least to some degree from the others, and their rating grades and standards are not uniform. This has created a situation in which a given insurer may have several ratings from different rating services.

#### **478 Part VII. Insurance Planning and Risk Management**

Nevertheless, as a practical matter, the rating services' gradings are probably the main, or perhaps the only, measures that most consumers will have of the financial soundness or claims-paying ability of particular insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance from an insurer, consumers should check into whether the company has been rated by one or more of the rating services and, if so, what its financial strength ratings are by each of the services that rated the insurer. Consumers also should inquire into whether the company's rating or ratings have recently been downgraded by any of the services and, if so, why.

Naturally, wealth management advisers should carefully evaluate these ratings, as well as other factors, before recommending an insurer.

While the ratings of the different services do not exactly correspond to each other, it will be helpful at least to list here the hierarchy of insurance company financial strength ratings for the three most widely followed rating services. These hierarchies of ratings, listed from highest to lowest, are as follows (the ratings of these services are not necessarily consistent with each other just because they are placed parallel in this listing):

| Moody's | Standard & Poor's | A.M. Best |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Aaa     | AAA               | A++       |
| Aa1     | AA+               | A+        |
| Aa2     | AA                | A         |
| Aa3     | AA–               | A–        |
| A1      | A+                |           |
| A2      | A                 | B++       |
| A3      | A–                | B+        |
| Baa1    | BBB+              |           |
| Baa2    | BBB               | B         |
| Baa3    | BBB–              | B–        |
| Ba1     | BB+               |           |
| Ba2     | BB                | C++       |
| Ba3     | BB–               | C+        |
| B1      | B+                |           |
| B2      | B                 | C         |
| B3      | B–                | C–        |
| Caa     | CCC               | D         |
| Ca      | CC                | E         |
| C       | D                 | F         |

**State Insurance Guaranty Funds** Some protection is provided to consumers by state guaranty funds, which may reimburse insureds and claimants for certain losses they may suffer due to the insolvency of insurance companies in the state. All states now have such guaranty funds that separately cover life insurance companies and property and liability insurance companies.

While these funds offer valuable protection to policyholders and claimants in the event of insurer insolvencies, there are limits to the amount of protection they provide, and the funds may not be available to cover all losses or in all circumstances. Therefore, it does not seem prudent for buyers of insurance to place primary reliance on state guaranty funds to protect them against insurer insolvencies. These funds are further described in Chapter 2.

**General Observations on Insurer Financial Soundness** Unfortunately, there are no hard-and-fast rules to guide consumers only to financially secure insurers. All that really can be offered are some general observations that may prove helpful.

- N It is very helpful for the insurer to be rated by at least two of the independent rating services and for their ratings to be consistent, stable, and on the high side of the hierarchy of ratings. What the minimum acceptable ratings might be is difficult to say, but an example might be that an insurer should be at least within the top three grades of at least two rating services, unless there is an adequate explanation of why this is not the case.
- N It is also helpful for the insurer to do business in and be subject to the regulation of one or more states with capable, effective insurance regulation, such as the state of New York.
- N Consumers should watch the general financial press for both unfavorable and positive news items about the insurer.
- N If the insurer's products or rates seem too good to be true, they probably are. Thus, if an insurer's product terms, prices, or rates of return are way out of line with those of comparable products generally available from other insurance companies, watch out!
- N From the viewpoint of financial strength, there may be advantages in dealing with insurers with proven records of financial soundness and stability over a reasonably long period. However, it must be stated that this comment has not held true in a few cases of well-established, formerly highly regarded insurers that unexpectedly (at least to their policyholders) ran into financial problems.
- N If an insurer does weaken financially, the insured or policyowner should evaluate whether to secure other coverage and then cancel the coverage with the weakened insurer (in the case of property and liability insurance), or whether to exchange a life insurance policy or an annuity contract in the weaker insurer for a comparable contract in a stronger insurer, which would be a tax-free exchange under Section 1035 of the Internal Revenue Code, provided the tax law requirements for such exchanges are met.

#### **Service**

There are many facets to the service an insurer might be expected to offer its customers. Naturally, *claims service—*the expeditiousness and fairness with which claims are settled—is a major consideration.

Other services also may be important to insureds. For example, life and health insurance needs analyses and other estate analysis services in life insurance, and risk analysis and insurance surveys for property and liability insurance, may be of considerable importance.

## **Types of Coverage**

The types of contracts an insurer offers are a consideration. Some insurers have a broader portfolio of policies than others have. Some insurers may offer policies that are more attractive in terms of coverage, price, or both in some areas, while others may have better contracts in other areas.

## **Price**

It is self-evident that the price charged for insurance is of significance to buyers. However, price considerations should never be placed above financial safety, since protection in an unstable organization is a questionable buy at any price. If a particular policy is available at a lower cost because the insurer provides less service, customers should evaluate how important the service is to them.

## **Considerations in Choosing an Agent or Broker**

How does an individual go about finding a good insurance agent or broker? (The distinction between an agent and a broker was noted in Chapter 2.) Some pertinent factors might be: What is the experience of the agent or broker in terms of years and extent of practice? Are they noted specialists in any certain line? Do they do business mostly with individual households, with business firms, or on a general across-the-board basis? Do they engage in survey selling or estate analysis? Do they present a unified program of coverage based on a careful analysis of exposures or needs? Do they represent a sound company or companies? Do they hold professional designations in insurance, as explained next?

## **Information about Financial Advisers**

Obtaining information about financial advisers probably is more difficult than investigating insurers. One positive indication of a financial planner's knowledge and basic professional commitment to his or her career is whether the person has earned the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation, the Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) and Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) designations, the Certified Employee Benefit Specialist (CEBS) designation, the Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter (CPCU) designation, and other corresponding professional degrees or designations. Depending on the particular program to obtain these designations, a practitioner must have passed a series of examinations covering such diverse fields as insurance and risk management, law, economics, social legislation, finance, investments, accounting, taxation, estate planning, employee benefits, and management. Although many competent practitioners do not have these designations and such designations do not always indicate competence, the consumer should be aware of the existence and meaning of CFP, CLU, ChFC, CEBS, and CPCU.
