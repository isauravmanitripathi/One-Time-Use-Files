- N Issues involving the retention of business interests
- N Estate liquidity through IRC Section 303 redemptions

When an individual or family has an interest in a closely held business, proper planning normally will be needed for various aspects of the business, such as its formation; operation; possible sale or liquidation; possible gifts of business interests; its disposition in the event of death, disability, or retirement of an owner; or its possible retention by the family.

# **Potential Issues**

These may include but are not limited to the following:

- N What kind of business entity or entities should be used for the business?
- N Who will control the business?
- N Will there be a market for the business if it has to be sold?
- N How will the business provide adequate income for the owners?
- N What will be the income tax status of the business and its owners?
- N How will the value of the business affect the taxes and liquidity needs of the owners' estates?
- N Will the business be able to continue if one of the owners dies, and what will happen to the business interest of a deceased owner?
- N How can the business best be sold to a new owner, if desired?
- N What will happen to the business and the owner if an owner becomes disabled?
- N How can the retirement of an owner be best planned for?
- N Should the owners be making gifts of business interests within the family and, if so, how much and in what form?
- N What is the legal status of the owners with respect to their personal liability for the debts, obligations, and tort claims against the business?

# **Characteristics of Closely Held Businesses**

We are all familiar with large publicly traded corporations whose shares are listed on various organized exchanges. When we discussed common stocks as an investment in Chapter 5, we were primarily concerned with the stocks of these publicly traded companies.

On the other hand, closely held businesses have a number of different characteristics, including the following:

- N They can be formed as one or more of several types of business entities, including LLCs, partnerships, sole proprietorships, S corporations, and C corporations.
- N They often are formed as pass-through entities (as described in Chapter 10) in that their profits and losses are not taxed at the business-entity level, but flow through to the owners individually and are taxed to (or deductible by) them personally. Thus, there normally is only one level of income taxation—at the individual owner's level.
- N They usually have only a small number of owners, and in many cases these are family members.
- N There normally is no ready market for these businesses.
- N Due to these and other factors, there usually is limited marketability of closely held business interests. Depending on the circumstances, there also may be lack of control over the business by some owners. These factors may provide a rationale for substantial valuation discounts, when such interests are given to family members or at their death.
- N Many owners of closely held businesses are also involved in the day-to-day management of those businesses. They are owner-managers. They may be stockholder–employees of closely held corporations, principals of partnerships, member-managers of LLCs, or sole proprietors. Regardless of the form, the point is that they often manage and control the businesses they own. This is in contrast to the situation of most stockholders of publicly traded companies, who effectively have no control over the corporation's affairs.
- N Again, due to the just-stated factors, the owner-managers of closely held businesses often can coordinate their business planning with their own personal and estate planning.

# **Types of Business Entities**

One important decision for a person or persons planning to start a business or who are already in business is what kind of business entity or entities to use in organizing their business.

# **Sole Proprietorships**

In this case, the business's assets, liabilities, and operations are simply part of the owner's personal financial affairs. There is no separate business entity. There can be only one owner. No formal documents or registrations are required. The business's profits and losses are automatically passed through to the sole proprietor for tax and other purposes. The sole proprietor has unlimited personal liability for the debts, tort liability, and other obligations of the business. Adequate commercial liability insurance is the owner's best protection against tort claims arising out of the business.

## **General Partnerships**

A partnership can be viewed as an association of two or more persons to carry on, as co-owners, a business for profit. There must be at least two partners to form a partnership, and it must have a business purpose. The term *person* in this definition is broad and can include virtually any individual or entity, such as U.S. citizens, resident aliens, nonresident aliens, corporations, LLCs, trusts, or other partnerships. Thus, there is essentially no limitation on who or what can be a partner in a partnership.

The partners of a general partnership (aside from an LLP, described in the next section) are jointly and severally liable for the debts, tort claims, and other obligations of the partnership. This means they have unlimited personal liability for any claims against the business, including those arising from the actions of other partners or other persons when acting for the business (so-called vicarious liability).

The state laws governing general partnerships generally are the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA), or variations of them. However, the partners in a written partnership agreement can modify the terms of these state laws with respect to their partnership if they wish. In the absence of such an agreement, the state partnership law applies. A general partnership is easy to form, and no state registration is required. There also does not need to be a written partnership agreement, although such an agreement is desirable.

General partnerships are pass-through entities for federal income tax purposes. Thus, the partnership itself pays no tax, and all items of partnership income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits flow through to the partners and are taxable to them individually. Each partner's share of these items normally is determined by the partnership agreement. However, the partnership must compute these items for tax purposes. Thus, a partnership can be viewed as a tax-reporting but not a taxpaying entity. The rules for partnership taxation are contained in Subchapter K of the IRC. These rules also apply to LPs, LLPs, and LLCs (assuming they are treated as partnerships).

## **Limited Partnerships (LPs)**

Limited partnerships are defined by state law and must be registered with the state. They have already been described in Chapter 27 with respect to the creation of FLPs. An LP must contain at least one general partner and one limited partner.

The general partner(s) of an LP has unlimited personal liability for the debts, tort claims, and other obligations of the partnership. However, other entities whose owners have limited liability, like LLCs and S corporations, can be the general partner. The liability of the limited partners for partnership obligations, on the other hand, normally is limited to their investment in the partnership. However, in return for this limited liability, limited partners cannot take part in the active management or conduct of the partnership to the extent specified in the applicable state law. If they do, they may be treated as general partners and lose their limited liability. As in the case of a general partnership, virtually any individual or entity can be a partner in an LP. The state laws governing LPs generally are the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA), or variations of them. There must be a written partnership agreement, and the formalities of these laws must be observed.

## **Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs)**

These may be formed under state laws that permit general partners to limit their personal liability for some partnership obligations. In many states, general partners in an LLP are not liable for the acts or omissions of other partners or of employees or agents of the partnership (other than those the general partner is directly supervising). In other words, general partners in LLPs essentially are relieved of their vicarious liability. In some states, they are also relieved of other partnership liabilities, like contractual claims. An LLP must register as such under the applicable state law.

## **Limited Liability Limited Partnerships (LLLPs)**

These are formed under some state laws that expressly permit limited partnerships to register as LLLPs. In this case, the general partner(s) can limit their personal liability generally for the act of others.

## **C Corporations**

These are corporations established under state corporation laws. They can have one or more stockholders, and virtually any person or entity can be a stockholder. There are no limits on the number or nature of C corporation stockholders. They can have one or more classes of stock in their capital structure. Thus, for example, a C corporation could have several classes of common stock or one or more classes of common stock and one or more classes of preferred stock. The liability of stockholders for corporate obligations normally is limited to their investment in the corporation. Also, stockholders can actively participate in the management and conduct of the corporation without losing this limited liability. In fact, stockholders of closely held C corporations often are stockholder–employees of the corporation.

C corporations are taxable entities under Subchapter C of the IRC. They are subject to the corporate income tax, the corporate alternative minimum tax,1 the tax on unreasonable accumulation of earnings, and other levies. Thus, among all the forms of business organization discussed here, the C corporation is the only form that is not a pass-through entity. It and its shareholders are exposed to the corporate double-tax. However, its shareholders are only taxed on dividends that are declared and paid by the corporation, and so as a practical matter, closely held C corporations often elect not to pay dividends to their common stockholders to the extent possible. The strategy of their stockholders often is to take profits out of the corporation in other ways so they will be deductible by the corporation and taxable only once at the stockholder level. Strategies for doing this are discussed later in this chapter. C corporations also are subject to double taxation of capital gains on a corporate liquidation (the so-called repeal of the General Utilities doctrine). However, again as noted in Chapter 11, there is a 50 percent (75 percent from 2009 until 2011) exclusion of gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock in a C corporation, subject to certain conditions.

## **S Corporations**

An S corporation is a regular corporation under state corporation law that meets certain qualification requirements under the tax law and elects (under Subchapter S of the IRC) not to be taxed as a corporation. In most other respects, an S corporation is like a C corporation. For example, S corporation stockholders normally have limited liability for corporate obligations and they often actively participate in the management and conduct of the corporation as stockholder–employees.

**Tax Status** An S corporation is taxed in most respects like a partnership, rather than a corporation. The S corporation itself generally pays no tax,2

<sup>1</sup>However, as noted in Chapter 10, the corporate AMT does not apply to C corporations that are small business corporations for this purpose (i.e., generally those with annual gross receipts not exceeding \$5 million).

<sup>2</sup> In certain situations, an S corporation may incur tax at the corporate level if it had formerly been a C corporation (i.e., had a C history). One situation is when the built-in gains in assets as of the date of conversion from C to S are sold or exchanged during the 10-year period after conversion. Another is when the former C was on LIFO inventory accounting. In this

and all items of corporate income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits flow through to the stockholders in proportion to their stockholdings and are taxable to them individually. However, the corporation must compute these items for tax purposes.

Thus, stockholders of S corporations are taxed on the net profits and gains of the corporation even if they do not receive any dividends from the corporation.3 In fact, since profits have already been taxed to the stockholders, dividends paid by S corporations normally are not taxable to the stockholders.4 This may put a financial strain on S corporation stockholders, particularly stockholders with minority interests, who may be receiving taxable income from the corporation but who perhaps have little or no control over whether the corporation pays any dividends with which the taxes might be paid. To provide these funds, and perhaps to avoid a situation in which minority stockholders in effect could be forced to sell their stock, S corporations in their bylaws or charters often require the payment of minimum dividends expressed as a percentage of their profits.

**Eligibility Requirements** Only a small business corporation can elect S corporation status. To be a small business corporation for this purpose, a corporation must meet the following requirements (among others):

- N It must be a domestic corporation.
- N It must have no more than 100 shareholders (with a husband and wife and all "members of a family" counted as one shareholder).
- N S corporations can have only certain classes of eligible shareholders. These can include:
  - Individuals (i.e., U.S. citizens or residents—nonresident aliens cannot be shareholders).
  - Grantor trusts. (Thus, for example, a revocable living trust created by an individual grantor who is a U.S. citizen or resident can be an S corporation shareholder. After the grantor's death, the trust can continue to be an S shareholder for two years.)
  - A trust created under a will (testamentary trust), but only for two years.
  - An estate of a deceased shareholder.

case, there will be LIFO recapture on conversion from C to S. Third, there may be tax on excess net passive income, and the S election may be terminated due to such income for three consecutive years.

3This is also true of other pass-through entities, like partnerships and LLCs, with respect to profits and distributions.

4 When an S corporation has earnings and profits (e.g., resulting from a C history), some dividends may be taxable when they exceed the accumulated adjustments account.

- A qualified subchapter S trust (QSST). These are trusts that meet special requirements, which include the following:
  - <sup>L</sup> The QSST has only one current income beneficiary, who is a U.S. citizen or resident.
  - <sup>L</sup> All trust income must be distributed currently to the one individual.
  - <sup>L</sup> The income interest of the current income beneficiary must terminate at the earlier of the beneficiary's death or the termination of the trust.
  - <sup>L</sup> Any corpus distributed during the current income beneficiary's lifetime can be distributed only to that beneficiary.
  - <sup>L</sup> Upon termination of the trust during the current income beneficiary's lifetime, the trust must distribute all its assets to the beneficiary.
- An electing small business trust (ESBT). These also are trusts that must meet special requirements, which include the following: The trust does not have beneficiaries other than individuals, an estate, or charitable organizations; no interest in the trust was acquired by purchase; and the trustee elected ESBT status. ESBTs are taxed on S corporation income at the highest individual income tax rate.
- Voting trusts.
- Certain exempt organizations (i.e., trusts for qualified retirement plans, such as ESOPs, and charitable organizations).
- N S corporations can have only one class of stock. However, if the only difference among the shares of common stock is in their voting rights, they are still considered as comprising one class of stock. Thus, an S corporation can have voting and nonvoting common stock. It can also have stock option plans for its employees and buy–sell agreements without violating the one-class-of-stock rule. Finally, an S corporation can have straight debt (i.e., a promise to pay a certain sum on demand or at a specified date, at an interest rate not contingent on profits and that is not convertible into stock, among other requirements) without that being considered a second class of stock.

If any of these conditions cease to be met, the S election normally is broken (terminated) and the corporation is taxed as a C corporation from that point on.

**Other Issues** All stockholders initially must consent to an S election. However, once made, an S election can be revoked (as opposed to being terminated when the requirements for being a small business corporation are no longer met) only by shareholders with more than 50 percent of the stock. Also, in general, once revoked or terminated, an election cannot be made again for five taxable years.

S corporations can have certain subsidiaries. They can own some or all the stock of C corporations, be members (or a single member) of LLCs, and be partners in a partnership. An S corporation also can own 100 percent of a qualified subchapter S subsidiary, which will be combined with its parent for tax purposes. However, C corporations, partnerships, LLCs, and trusts (other than those described previously) still are not eligible shareholders of S corporations.

The just-noted rules apply to the federal income taxation of S corporations. However, states also may have S corporation statutes. Some of these mirror federal law; others have different provisions. Also, some states tax S corporations in varying degrees.

#### **Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)**

The limited liability company is a newer form of business organization that probably is the fastest-growing type today. It combines the advantages of limited liability and freedom to have management control of corporations with the pass-through and other tax advantages of partnerships. It also is free from the eligibility requirements of S corporations.

LLCs are created under state law and must be registered with the state. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have LLC statutes.5 A number of these laws either permit or do not forbid single-member LLCs. However, with respect to many matters, the members of an LLC in their written operating agreement can alter the terms of these state laws with respect to their LLC if they wish. Usually, in the absence of a contrary provision in the operating agreement, the state LLC law applies.

Persons or entities that have ownership interests in an LLC and can influence its management and operations are referred to as *members.* However, there also can be equity owners (nonmembers) who do not have a say in management. Also, LLCs can have managers who manage the affairs of the business. Thus, LLCs may be member-managed (where the members are engaged in running the operation) or manager-managed (where the members select a manager to run the business).

LLC statutes normally relieve the members from personal liability for the debts, obligations, and liabilities of the LLC. However, they can still actively participate in management without losing this limited liability.

<sup>5</sup>A Uniform Limited Liability Company Act has been adopted in some states.

**Tax Status** Under the check-the-box regulations (described next), an LLC normally will elect to be taxed like a partnership. Thus, it is a pass-through entity and pays no tax itself. All items of income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits flow through to the members and are reported on their individual tax returns. Each member's share of these items normally is determined by the operating agreement.

**Other Factors** LLCs can be flexible in their formation, structure, and operation. They are relatively easy to form, usually by filing their articles of organization with the state. LLCs can have any number of members (including only one member in many states), and the members essentially can be any person or entity. LLCs can have more than one class of equity interest. They normally do not have to observe many of the formalities often required of corporations under state corporation laws. These might include annual shareholder meetings, certain financial statements, boards of directors, appointment of officers, bylaws, minutes of proceedings, and so forth.6 State tax laws also apply to LLCs. Some states follow the federal tax approach; others may levy some taxes on LLCs.

## **Business Trusts**

Some states allow businesses to organize as business trusts. These are not common, however.

# **Use of Multiple Entities**

Businesses often employ several of these forms of organization. For example, an S corporation or an LLC can be the general partner of a limited partnership. This would provide flow-through tax treatment and limited liability for all interests. Also, an S corporation can have subsidiary LLCs (or subsidiary S corporations). This would provide flow-through tax treatment, limited liability, and separation of businesses or operations. Furthermore, C corporations could have subsidiary LLCs or be partners in a partnership.

<sup>6</sup>On the other hand, it should be noted that many states have adopted so-called close corporation statutes in various forms. These laws are intended to relieve smaller, closely held corporations from many of the formalities required of larger, publicly traded corporations. They may also relieve shareholders from personal liability for the debts and obligations of their corporation on the ground that the corporation did not observe the usual formalities in the exercise of its corporate powers and management. The failure to observe such formalities has been a basis for creditors to "pierce the corporate veil" in some cases.

## **Further Thoughts on the Legal Liability Issue**

Business owners usually are anxious to have freedom from personal liability for the debts, obligations, and tort claims against their business interests. Of the business forms just described, all provide at least some degree of limited liability, except for general partners not in LLPs or LLLPs.

However, even with the protection afforded by these forms of business organization, some cautions are in order. First, business owners (and everyone else for that matter) are personally liable for tort and other liability arising from their own conduct or misconduct. No form of business organization protects against this, and since closely held business owners often are involved in the management and conduct of their businesses, they may find themselves personally liable for their own actions in this regard. Second, some forms may not provide complete protection from personal liability, such as LLPs and LLLPs possibly for contractual claims and LPs for limited partners who take part in management. Third, many times, owners of closely held businesses will be asked to personally endorse bank or other loans for the business. This will make them personally liable for their payment. Finally, some courts may find stockholders personally liable for certain claims against or obligations of their corporations because they are stockholders. This is referred to as the *corporate veil doctrine.* It is not the general rule, but such liability is possible.

Therefore, commercial liability insurance with adequate limits (or umbrella coverage) still is important for closely held businesses and their owners. Such insurance not only will indemnify insureds for covered liability claims against them, but will also defend them (and pay the defense costs) for such claims. Also, owners should be included as insureds under such coverage.

# **Check-the-Box Regulations**

Check-the-box regulations have already been discussed in Chapter 10. In essence, they provide that an entity organized under a state or federal law as a corporation will be taxed as a C corporation or an S corporation. Other organizations, called *eligible entities,* can elect how they wish to be taxed. Eligible entities essentially would be partnerships and LLCs. Eligible entities with two or more owners can elect to be taxed as a corporation or as a partnership. Eligible entities with a single owner (e.g., single-member LLCs) can elect to be disregarded as a separate entity for tax purposes—they will simply be taxed as part of their owners. Eligible entities generally will elect to be taxed as partnerships or disregarded for tax purposes.

## **Income Tax Basis in Business Interests**

Like other assets, owners of closely held business interests have an income tax basis in their interests. This is referred to as their *outside basis* in their interests. It is analogous to the basis that stockholders of publicly traded corporations have in the stock they own, although it may be acquired and operate differently in the context of closely held business interests.

On the other hand, the basis a business has in its own assets is called its *inside basis.* This difference from outside basis exists because a business is a separate entity from its owners. In the case of pass-through entities, gains or losses from the sale of assets by the business and depreciation on assets flow through to the individual owners for tax purposes. Thus, a pass-through entity's inside basis in its assets will directly affect its owners.

At the formation of a business, the new owners will acquire basis in their interests. In a nontaxable transaction, this basis normally will equal the cash contributed plus the adjusted basis of assets contributed to form the business.7 When a business interest is purchased, its basis normally is the purchase price (cost). When interests are received as gifts, there is a carryover basis, and when inherited, the basis is the fair market value at death. From this point on, however, there are significant differences between C corporations and pass-through entities.

For C corporations, the stockholders' bases in their stock generally do not change because of the operations of the business.8 On the other hand, for pass-through entities, the owners' bases do change because of the operations of the business. For example, a partner's outside basis in his or her partnership interest will be increased by his or her share of taxable income of the partnership, capital gains of the partnership, income of the partnership which is tax exempt—e.g., life insurance proceeds, the amount of cash and the adjusted basis of assets contributed by him or her to the partnership plus

7For corporations, when appreciated property is transferred to them as part of their formation, it normally will be a nontaxable event if the transferors receive only stock in return and immediately after the exchange, the transferors own 80 percent or more of the stock of the corporation. For partnerships, generally, contributions of appreciated property to a partnership in return for a partnership interest is a nontaxable event at any time. These are tax-free exchanges, as described in Chapter 10. However, there may be gain if the property contributed is subject to liabilities, and there normally will be income if stock or a partnership interest is received in return for services.

8There are some exceptions to this. For example, if stockholders receive dividends in excess of the earnings and profits of the corporation, the excess is a return of basis and reduces basis.

any gain recognized on such contributions, and generally, liabilities incurred by the partnership (called entity-level debt). Correspondingly, a partner's outside basis will be decreased by his or her share of partnership losses, nondeductible partnership expenditures not chargeable to a capital account, generally any reduction of partnership liabilities, and distributions he or she receives from the partnership. The same treatment applies to members of LLCs that are taxed as partnerships. For shareholders of S corporations, the same generally is true, except that their bases are not increased by entity-level debt, but a shareholder's basis for purposes of deducting losses is increased by *his or her loans* to the corporation. Basis is necessary to determine gain or loss on the sale or liquidation of a business interest. Also, the owner of an interest in a pass-through entity cannot deduct losses in excess of his or her basis.

# **Factors in Choice of Entity**

Choice of entity often involves consideration of a number of issues—many of which are outlined here. These issues can be complex, and a detailed discussion of them is beyond the scope of this book.

# **Liability of Owners**

The owner liability issue has been discussed previously.

# **Tax Status of Entity and Owners**

This also has been discussed previously. The trend seems to be toward pass-through entities, as opposed to C corporations, which are potentially exposed to double taxation. However, there may be various business reasons for the use of C corporations (e.g., intention to go public or desire for more than one class of stock). Also, closely held C corporations in practice may be able to avoid or mitigate potential double taxation through several strategies, as described next. However, each of these strategies has practical limits.

N *Payment of salaries, bonuses, and so forth, to stockholder–employees*. These are deductible at the corporate level and taxable as compensation to stockholder–employees. However, the limit on such payments is that the compensation must be reasonable and customary for tax purposes. This is a facts-and-circumstances test and depends on the situation. But in the case of unreasonable compensation, the IRS will recharacterize the compensation as nondeductible dividends.

- N *Compensation to family members on the payroll*. Here again, the limit is that the compensation must be reasonable for the services performed.
- N *Employee benefits for stockholder–employees*. These are currently deductible at the corporate level and are either not taxable or not currently taxable to the shareholder-employees, depending on the employee benefit. However, the limits on such benefits are that total compensation (including the employee benefits) must be reasonable and customary, and most employee benefits cannot discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees who, as a practical matter, often would be the stockholder– employees.9
- N *Deferred compensation for stockholder–employees*. Here again, these payments will be deductible by the corporation and taxable as ordinary income to the shareholder-former employees when actually made. These arrangements can be discriminatory. The limits on such arrangements are that they must be entered into in advance, must be reasonable, and probably should be justified by compensation studies.
- N *Leasing assets from stockholders*. In this case, the rental payments are deductible by the C corporation and are taxable as rent (ordinary income) to the stockholder-owners. Stockholders often will retain real estate used in the business in their own names and rent it to their business. This not only takes money from the corporation with only one level of taxation (to the property owner), but also gives the stockholder-owners the tax advantages of owning real estate directly. The limit to this strategy is that the rent must not exceed a fair market rental value.
- N *Lending money to the corporation*. Here, the stockholders make loans to their corporation at fair market interest. The interest is deductible by the corporation and taxable to the stockholder-creditors as ordinary income. The limits on this strategy are that the interest should be reasonable, the interest must be on true debt and not a disguised dividend, debt should not be an excessive proportion of the corporation's capitalization, and the fact that debt may be a financial burden on the corporation.
- N *Gifts of closely held stock to charity and then redemption of the stock by the corporation*. This is the *charity bailout* described in Chapter 19. The limits on this technique are that the stockholder should want to make a charitable contribution in any event (since he or she receives only a deduction, not income) and the general limits on charitable contributions.

<sup>9</sup>Disability income benefits and insured health (medical expense) benefits do not have to be nondiscriminatory.

N *While not a strategy to produce only one level of taxation, there has been the approach of paying income tax at the corporate level (perhaps at the 15 or 25 percent bracket), accumulating earnings and profits inside the C corporation, and then liquidating or selling the corporation and paying capital gains tax at the shareholder level*. 10 To be successful, the combined taxes on corporate income and on capital gains at liquidation or sale should be less than the individual tax rates of the shareholders because that is the amount that will be paid on profits in a flow-through entity. While this strategy will be helped by the reduction in capital gains rate on eligible qualified small business stock and by reductions in tax rate on capital gains (and dividends) in general, it is less likely to be attractive when individual income tax rates are reduced relative to corporate income tax rates.

# **Ease of Formation and Operation**

Partnerships and LLCs generally are easier to form and operate than corporations.

# **Number and Nature of Owners**

If the business is to have only one owner, a sole proprietorship, singlemember LLC, S corporation, or C corporation must be used. On the other hand, if a business is to have more than 100 owners (e.g., shareholders), an S corporation cannot be used. There also are other eligibility requirements on who can own S corporation stock.

# **Nature of Management and Control Desired**

The forms can differ in this respect, as noted previously.

# **Transferability of Interests**

Traditionally, stock of corporations has been viewed as being freely transferable, while full transfers of partnership interests have required the consent of the other partners or at least some of them. In practice, however, the bylaws of closely held corporations often limit the transferability of their stock.

<sup>10</sup>There may also be capital gains tax on appreciated assets at the corporate level under the repeal of the General Utilities doctrine concept.

This may be particularly true in the case of S corporations where the S election can be broken by a transfer to an ineligible person or entity.

# **Continuity of Life**

Here again, corporations traditionally have had continuity of life, regardless of the death, retirement, bankruptcy, or other condition of the stockholders. For general partnerships and generally under LLC statutes, however, the death, retirement, bankruptcy, and certain other conditions of a partner or member will cause dissolution of the entity. Even so, the business can continue with the agreement of all or a majority of the owners.

For limited partnerships, only the death, retirement, bankruptcy, and so forth of the last remaining general partner will dissolve the partnership. Here again, the partnership can continue with the consent of all or a majority of the limited partners.

# **Ease of Termination**

A partnership (or a partner's interest) generally can be liquidated (terminated) without taxable gain to the partners, except to the extent that the cash (generally including marketable securities) distributed exceeds a partner's basis in his or her partnership interest, with certain exceptions. Thus, in effect, partnership assets generally can be distributed in kind to a liquidating partner or partners without current taxation. The same treatment is true for LLCs that are taxed as partnerships.

For corporations, however, there may be taxable gain on liquidation (termination). In the case of S corporations with appreciated assets, there will be taxable gain at the corporate level, which will be passed through to the shareholders. However, the bases of the shareholders' stock will increase by the amount of the gain and so there often will not be double taxation for liquidating S corporation shareholders—only a single level of capital gains taxation at the shareholder level. For C corporations with appreciated assets, under the so-called repeal of the General Utilities doctrine, there will be taxable gain at the corporate level and then capital gain at the shareholder level on the difference between the cash and the value of the property distributed in liquidation and the stockholders' income tax bases in their stock. Thus, there will be double taxation on liquidation of C corporations.

Also, the conversion of a partnership or LLC to a corporation generally will not be a taxable event. However, there generally will be tax on the conversion of a corporation to a partnership or LLC.

These tax flexibilities tend to favor the partnership and LLC forms. They are easier to form and operate and to terminate.

# **Future Plans for the Business**

If the plans are that the business will soon go public (perhaps in an IPO) or be sold to another firm, a C corporation may be preferred. This may also be true if the business is to be kept in a family for a long time. On the other hand, if it is planned for the business to terminate or for capital distributions to be taken from it fairly soon, this may favor a partnership or LLC.

# **Availability of Special Allocations**

Partnership agreements and operating agreements of LLCs can allocate items of income, gain, loss, deductions, or credits among the partners or members other than according to their interests in the entity, provided the allocation has substantial economic effect.11 These are referred to as *special allocations.*  Corporations generally cannot have such allocations (i.e., profits and losses are allocated according to shares of stock owned), although C corporations can have more than one class of stock with different distribution rights.

# **Availability of Tax-Favored Employee Benefits for Owners**

This is a complex and changing issue. It centers on the fact that stockholders who work for their own corporations are employees of the corporation, while partners and members of LLCs who similarly work in their businesses are principals or owners but not technically employees. Tax-favored employee benefit plans are for employees, unless there are specific statutory provisions stating otherwise.

**Qualified Retirement Plans** Stockholder–employees of corporations can be covered as employees under these plans and secure their full benefits. Also, self-employed persons (i.e., sole proprietors, partners, and LLC members) who have self-employment earnings as a result of rendering personal services can be covered on essentially the same basis under HR-10 plans. Thus, there is substantial parity or equality under qualified retirement plans between stockholder–employees and self-employed persons.

<sup>11</sup> In general, this means they are likely to affect the economic positions of the partners or members.

**Health (Medical Expense) Insurance** Stockholder–employees of C corporations can be covered as employees for full benefits on a tax-favored basis under their corporation's health insurance plan. This means employer contributions for employee and dependent coverage are deductible by the C corporation and not gross income to the stockholder–employees.

Self-employed persons are allowed a deduction on their personal tax returns for the amount paid for health insurance for the self-employed person, his or her spouse, and his or her dependents. A more-than-2-percent shareholder of an S corporation is treated as a partner (self-employed person) for this purpose.

**Other Welfare (Fringe) Benefits** Stockholder–employees of C corporations can be covered as employees for full benefits on a tax-favored basis under a variety of other welfare benefits. These include the cost of the first \$50,000 of group term life insurance, the cost of disability income insurance, benefits under a cafeteria plan, and the value of certain miscellaneous fringe benefits. Thus, employer contributions for such benefits are deductible by the C corporation and are not gross income to the stockholder–employees.

For self-employed persons and more-than-2-percent S corporation shareholders, however, there is no tax deduction for contributions for these benefits. In effect, they are purchased with after-tax dollars. Thus, C corporation stockholder–employees have an advantage here over self-employed persons and more-than-2-percent S corporation shareholders.

# **Other Factors**

A variety of other factors might be considered when selecting the business entity form, including state tax issues.

# **Disposition of Business Interests**

At a certain point, closely held business interests may be disposed of by the owner or owners for value in a variety of ways. Alternatively, interests may be given away to or retained for the owner's family.

## **Sales of Business Interests**

Owners may decide to sell their businesses or business interests during their lifetime. The sales may be to co-owners, key employees, family members, or unrelated parties. Also, the business itself may redeem the stock of a stockholder (a stock redemption) or liquidate the interest of a partner. The economic and tax consequences can differ, depending on the type of business organization and the form of the sale.

When sole proprietors sell their businesses, they are essentially selling the assets. They may have gains or losses on individual assets. When a partner sells or exchanges his or her partnership interest, the selling partner will realize and recognize capital gain or loss on the difference between the amount realized from the sale and his or her adjusted basis in the partnership interest. A partnership interest generally is a capital asset for tax purposes. However, under the collapsible partnership rules, gain will be ordinary income to the extent there is substantially appreciated inventory or unrealized receivables as partnership assets.12

There is a special rule for partnerships that allows the partnership to elect to adjust the bases of the partnership assets (i.e., the inside bases) with respect to a purchaser's interest to reflect the difference between the purchaser's outside basis in the partnership interest being purchased (the purchase price plus the purchaser's share of partnership liabilities) and the purchaser's share of the original (before adjustment) inside bases of the partnership assets. In effect, this permits a partnership to elect to allow a purchaser to force his or her outside basis into his or her share of the inside bases of partnership assets.13 While this may involve some complicated accounting, it can be an attractive election on behalf of a purchasing (or inheriting) partner because his or her share of inside basis will affect his or her share of partnership gains, profits, or losses. There is no comparable IRC provision applying to corporations.

These partnership tax rules also apply to LLCs that have elected to be taxed as partnerships under the check-the-box rules.

For sales of corporations, there is a fundamental choice between sale of stock and sale of assets. In the case of sales of stock, the owners sell their stock to the purchaser, who then acquires the stock (ownership) of the existing corporation. The selling stockholders will realize and recognize capital gain or loss on the difference between the amount realized on the sale and their adjusted bases in their stock. There will be one level of tax for them. The purchaser will acquire the stock of the corporation for the purchase price, the bases of the assets inside the corporation will remain the same, and the

<sup>12</sup>These are sometimes called Section 751 assets or *hot assets.*

<sup>13</sup>This election is permitted under Section 754 of the IRC. It also can apply when a partnership interest is inherited. This could be under a deceased partner's will or under a successorin-interest provision in a partnership agreement. In either case, the inheriting partner's outside basis would be the partnership interest's fair market value at the date of death (i.e., its stepped-up basis at death).

purchaser generally cannot amortize the cost of any assets.14 The purchaser also will be responsible for the liabilities of the corporation, such as contractual claims, possibly underfunded pension plans, and environmental liability. On the other hand, the purchaser may get the benefit of favorable contracts, permits, and licenses held by the purchased corporation.

In the case of an asset sale, the buyer purchases the assets from the corporation. The selling corporation may then be liquidated and pay off its liabilities and distribute its remaining assets to the shareholders. If it is a C corporation, there will be two levels of tax for the sellers. First, the corporation will recognize gain on the sale of its assets at the corporate tax rate. Then, when it is liquidated, the shareholders will realize and recognize capital gain at the individual level on the difference between the amount they receive in liquidation and their bases in their stock. If it is an S corporation, there normally will be only one level of tax because it is a flow-through entity. The corporation will recognize gain on the sale of its assets, but this gain will be passed on to the shareholders and be taxable to them. The gain will increase their bases in the corporation, which may eliminate any gain to them on liquidation of the corporation. However, for S corporations that had been C corporations, there will be a corporate-level tax on the gain from any appreciated assets held by the corporation at the date of conversion from C to S and sold within 10 years after conversion. This corporate-level gain is measured by the values of the assets at the date of conversion. This is called the *built-in-gain* provision.

The buyer in an asset sale secures an increased basis in the assets acquired (the purchase price allocated to them) and can amortize the cost of intangible assets (e.g., customer lists) and goodwill over 15 years. This allows the buyer an income tax deduction over this 15-year period. Also, the buyer is not liable for corporate obligations since he or she has not acquired the corporation itself. However, some potential liabilities, such as environmental exposures from assets, still may be passed on to the buyer.

Due to these factors, sellers often prefer to sell stock, while buyers want to purchase assets. Sometimes, the price or terms of a sale can be adjusted to satisfy the goals of both parties. Structuring sales can be complex and often requires professional advice.

Closely held business interests may be the subject of an installment sale, since they are not publicly traded. In this case, care should be taken that the

<sup>14</sup>The purchaser can, however, amortize the cost (over 15 years) of items acquired coincident with the purchase of stock, such as a reasonable noncompetition agreement with the former owner or owners. Also, the corporation can deduct payments when made under a previously made and reasonable nonqualified deferred-compensation agreement with the former owner that, in effect, is part of the sale transaction.

buyer will be able to carry out his or her obligations. Sometimes, the price paid for a business or business interest will not be fixed, but will depend in part on the future profits of the business. This is called an *earnout.* Earnouts may seem attractive to both buyer and seller, but again, care should be taken because it can be difficult to determine just what the profits of a closely held business are.

## **Liquidation of Business Interests**

As just noted, businesses can be liquidated during the owners' lifetimes. For partnerships and LLCs taxed as partnerships, there generally will not be any taxable gain to the partners on liquidation, unless cash (including marketable securities) distributed exceeds the partners' bases in their partnership interests. In the case of S corporations, there generally will be one level of taxation at the shareholder level on liquidation (aside from the built-in-gain issue). For C corporations, there generally will be double taxation on liquidation: once at the corporate level and again as capital gain at the shareholder level.

## **Gifts of Business Interests**

Owners of closely held businesses may want to make gifts of part of their interests during their lifetimes, normally to family members. Older business owners may want to bring their children or other family members into the business and reward them with gifts of stock, partnership interests, or interests in LLCs. Family members with controlling interests may begin to turn the business over to younger family members through gifts in tax-effective ways. Closely held business interests also may be placed in FLPs or LLCs.

However, an issue with respect to such gifts is control of the business. Older family members may or may not wish to maintain control. If they want to retain control, they can organize the business into different interests (e.g., voting and nonvoting stock of C or S corporations) and give away noncontrolling interests (e.g., nonvoting stock) in trust or outright. Or, they can put the business or part of it in an FLP and be the general partner or control an entity that is the general partner. Or, they may not give away enough of an interest to shift control from themselves.

When the owner of a controlled corporation15 transfers the corporation's stock to an irrevocable trust (or otherwise) but retains the right to vote the stock for his or her lifetime or for a period that does not end before his or her death, it is viewed for transfer tax purposes as the owner's retaining the enjoyment of the transferred stock for his or her lifetime. This will cause

<sup>15</sup>For this purpose, control means retention of the right to vote 20 percent or more of the combined voting stock.

the full value of the transferred stock to be included in the transferor's gross estate at his or her death (like the retention of a life income). The same control generally can be secured by reorganizing the corporation in a tax-free organization to have voting and nonvoting stock and then giving away the nonvoting stock in trust or otherwise.

In giving partnership interests or membership interests in LLCs taxed as partnerships to family members, the family partnership rules need to be considered. These require that before such gifts will be recognized for income tax purposes, the donor partner's personal contributions to the partnership must be recognized in the sharing of profits, and capital must be a material income-producing factor in the partnership. For gifts of S corporation stock within the family, the IRS has statutory authority to reallocate the profits of the S corporation among the shareholders if a donor shareholder's personal services to the corporation are not adequately recognized by a reasonable salary. These provisions are intended to prevent using gifts of interests in passthrough entities to, in effect, shift personal earnings from a donor–owner to lower-bracket family members.

Closely held business interests also may be contributed to a CRT and then sold by the CRT, as explained in Chapter 19.

#### **Exchange of Stock in a Tax-Free Reorganization**

In this situation, owners of a closely held corporation exchange their stock tax free for stock of a publicly traded corporation. They can retain this stock until death, at which time it gets a stepped-up income tax basis, or sell it, provided they do not immediately have it redeemed by the issuing corporation. The former owner(s) may even remain on as employees of the publicly traded company. The approach was described and illustrated in Chapter 11.

## **Sale of Stock to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)**

In this case, the stockholder normally sells some or all of his or her stock to the corporation's own leveraged ESOP. This technique also was explained and illustrated in Chapter 11.

#### **Sale or Redemption at Death Under a Buy–Sell Agreement**

Assuming an immediate sale, liquidation, or tax-free exchange of a business interest is not contemplated, the owner(s) must consider what will happen to their business upon the death or disability of one of them. One commonly used approach to this issue is a previously existing buy–sell agreement to operate at death and perhaps at disability as well.

#### **Partnerships**

*Business Continuation Issues:* The death of a general partner legally dissolves the partnership, and the deceased partner's interest in the business must be settled. Normally, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the surviving partner or partners succeed to the ownership of the firm's assets as *liquidating trustees.* Thus, in the absence of an agreement entered into during the partners' lifetimes providing for the continuation of the business, there may be two alternatives at a partner's death: the business may be reorganized or it may be terminated (i.e., liquidated or wound up).

*A Partnership Buy–Sell Agreement:* This is a written agreement entered into during the partners' lifetimes between the individual partners (crosspurchase type of agreement) or between the partnership and the partners (entity type of agreement), providing for the sale and purchase of a deceased partner's interest. It establishes a mutually agreeable price for each partner's interest and should contain a provision for adjusting the purchase price if the value of the business changes. Life insurance can be used to fund the agreement by providing the immediate cash to purchase a deceased's interest. There are two main kinds of partnership buy–sell agreements—the *crosspurchase plan* and the *entity plan.* Table 31.1 illustrates both for a partnership of three equal partners valued at \$1,200,000.

*Tax Aspects:* The income tax aspects of partnership buy–sell agreements can be complicated and are only summarized here. Life insurance premiums, whether paid by the individual partners or the partnership, are not deductible for income tax purposes since the premium payor(s) are either directly or indirectly beneficiaries under the life insurance policies. Such payments are considered personal rather than business expenses. Life insurance death proceeds are received by the beneficiary(ies) income tax–free.

The proceeds received by the partnership or the partners are used as payments to purchase the deceased partner's interest from his or her estate. The estate normally will not realize gain or loss on the sale because the deceased's interest usually gets a stepped-up income tax basis at death (except for unrealized receivables and substantially appreciated inventory). Correspondingly, in a cross-purchase-type agreement, the buying partners can increase their bases in their partnership interests by the amount they paid for the decedent's interest. In an entity-type agreement, the surviving partners receive substantially the same effect on their outside bases because of the pass-through nature of a partnership, although this may depend on the timing of the sale and receipt of the insurance proceeds.

For estate tax purposes, upon a partner's death, the value of his or her partnership interest will be included in the deceased's gross estate, just like

**Table 31.1.** Partnership Value \$1,200,000

| Partner A Owns a    | Partner B Owns a    | Partner C Owns a    |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| One-Third Interest: | One-Third Interest: | One-Third Interest: |
| \$400,000           | \$400,000           | \$400,000           |

#### **Cross-purchase agreement**

The three partners agree in writing on the value of their interests and that in the event of the death of a partner, the estate of the deceased will sell the interest of the deceased and the surviving partners will buy it.

#### **Life insurance to fund agreement**

| A insures:      | B insures:      | C insures:      |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| B for \$200,000 | A for \$200,000 | A for \$200,000 |
| C for \$200,000 | C for \$200,000 | B for \$200,000 |

Each partner is the applicant, owner, premium payor, and beneficiary of the policies on the other two partners.

#### **At death**

Each surviving partner utilizes the insurance proceeds on the deceased partner's life that he or she receives as beneficiary to purchase one-half of the deceased partner's interest from his or her estate, according to the terms of the buy–sell agreement. (There may be a disability provision in the agreement to meet this risk as well.)

#### **Entity agreement**

The three partners agree in writing on the value of their interests and that in the event of the death of a partner, the estate of the deceased will sell the interest of the deceased and the partnership will buy it.

#### **Life insurance to fund agreement**

Partnership insures A for \$400,000, B for \$400,000, and C for \$400,000. The partnership is the applicant, owner, premium payor, and beneficiary of all policies.

#### **At death**

The partnership utilizes the insurance proceeds on the deceased partner's life that it receives as beneficiary to purchase the deceased partner's interest from his or her estate, according to the terms of the buy– sell agreement. (There may be a disability provision in the agreement to meet this risk as well.)

any other asset he or she owns. However, a difficulty with closely held business interests is that they often are difficult to value. But when a properly drawn buy–sell agreement exists, normally only the purchase price set in the agreement will be included in a deceased partner's gross estate, provided the requirements of Chapter 14 of the IRC (described later) and the commonlaw rules regarding valuation are met.

**Close Corporations** In a close corporation (either a C or an S corporation), stock ownership normally is limited to a small group of individuals, the stockholders often are employees of the corporation, and the stock is, of course, not publicly traded. Unlike a general partnership, which by law technically is dissolved upon a partner's death, a corporation continues in existence after a stockholder's death. However, in practice, the death of a close-corporation stockholder usually has far-reaching and often negative consequences for the other stockholders and the corporation itself. These consequences frequently make a buy–sell agreement taking effect at the death or disability of a stockholder desirable.

*A Corporate Buy–Sell Agreement:* This is a written agreement between the individual stockholders (a cross-purchase agreement) or between the corporation and its stockholders (a stock retirement or stock redemption agreement) providing for the sale and purchase of the stock of a deceased stockholder. The agreement would establish the purchase price for the stock and should provide for periodic adjustments of the price as the value of the business changes over time. Life insurance on the stockholders' lives is normally used to fund the agreement. Table 31.2 illustrates how a cross-purchase and a stock retirement buy–sell arrangement would operate for a close corporation with three equal stockholders and is valued at \$1,200,000.

*Tax Aspects:* As in the case of partnerships, the tax aspects of buy–sell agreements can be complex. Only the basic rules are summarized here.

N *Income Taxation.* Whether paid by the stockholders or by the corporation, life insurance premiums are not deductible, since the premium payor(s) are either directly or indirectly beneficiaries under the policies.

Life insurance death proceeds generally are received by beneficiaries free of federal income tax. This normally is true whether the beneficiary is the corporation or the individual stockholders.16

<sup>16</sup>When the individual stockholders are the beneficiaries (in a cross-purchase plan), a special rule—the *transfer-for-value* rule (described in Chapter 29)—possibly could apply under certain circumstances and cause a portion of the proceeds to be taxed as income. This would happen if a surviving stockholder should purchase a policy on another stockholder's life from a deceased stockholder's estate. In this case, there would be no exception under the transferfor-value rule for the sale of the policy. Therefore, such a purchase should not be made in a corporate cross-purchase-type agreement.

|  | Table 31.2. Corporation Value \$1,200,000 |  |  |
|--|-------------------------------------------|--|--|
|--|-------------------------------------------|--|--|

| Stockholder A Owns | Stockholder B Owns | Stockholder C Owns |

#### **Cross-purchase agreement**

The three stockholders agree in writing on the value of the stock and that in the event of the death of a stockholder, the estate of the deceased will sell the stock of the deceased and the surviving stockholders will buy it.

#### **Life insurance to fund agreement**

| A insures:      | B insures:      | C insures:      |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| B for \$200,000 | A for \$200,000 | A for \$200,000 |
| C for \$200,000 | C for \$200,000 | B for \$200,000 |

Each stockholder is the applicant, owner, premium payor, and beneficiary of the policies on the other two stockholders.

#### **At death**

Each surviving stockholder uses the insurance proceeds to purchase one-half of the deceased stockholder's stock from his or her estate, according to the terms of the buy–sell agreement. (There may also be a disability provision in the agreement to meet this risk.)

#### **Stock retirement agreement**

The three stockholders and the corporation agree in writing on the value of the stock and that in the event of the death of a stockholder, the estate of the deceased will sell the stock of the deceased and the corporation will buy it.

#### **Life insurance to fund agreement**

Corporation insures: A for \$400,000 B for \$400,000

C for \$400,000

The corporation is the applicant, premium payor, owner, and beneficiary of all policies.

#### **At death**

The corporation uses the insurance proceeds to purchase the deceased stockholder's stock from his or her estate, according to the terms of the buy–sell agreement. (There may also be a disability provision in the agreement to meet this risk.)

In addition, for C corporations, a complication is introduced by the corporate AMT. For C corporations, an amount that increases alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) is 75 percent of the amount by which a corporation's adjusted current earnings (ACE) exceeds its AMTI (without regard to its ACE) for the year. The tax-deferred (tax-free) investment growth of life insurance cash values would be included in ACE for this purpose, as would the difference between life insurance death proceeds and the policy's basis for AMT purposes. As a practical matter, this means that 75 percent of these otherwise nontaxable items for regular tax purposes may be subject to the corporate AMT rate. This will be true only for COLI by C corporations. However, this AMT issue has been eliminated for many closely held corporations by the repeal of the AMT on small business corporations, as described in Chapter 10.

A stock interest in a corporation is considered a capital asset. Thus, the purchase price normally will not result in a capital gain or loss for the estate because the estate would have a stepped-up income tax basis following the stockholder's death.

In the case of a cross-purchase buy–sell agreement, the purchasing stockholders will be able to increase their bases in their stock by the purchase price. This will not be true, however, in the case of a stock retirement agreement for a C corporation.

N *Estate Taxation.* If the appropriate items are included in the buy–sell agreement, normally only the purchase price actually paid for the stock will be included in a deceased stockholder's estate for federal estate tax purposes. This again depends on meeting the rules for Chapter 14 of the IRC, as described next.

**Sole Proprietors** A sole proprietorship is not a separate entity apart from the individual proprietor. The sole proprietor, in an economic sense, is the business, and unless plans are made during his or her lifetime, the business often will die with its owner. However, three alternatives for disposing of the business may be available: orderly liquidation or sale, family retention, and sale to an employee (perhaps through a buy–sell agreement entered into in advance).

# **Chapter 14 Special Valuation Rules**

As explained in Chapters 11 and 26, Chapter 14 of the IRC deals with certain special valuation rules for gift tax and estate tax purposes with regard to certain transfers of interests among family members. These valuation rules are quite complex, and a complete discussion of them is beyond the scope of this book.

One section of Chapter 14 (Section 2703–Certain Rights and Restrictions Disregarded) provides certain requirements for valuation provisions in buy–sell agreements. This section provides that the value of any property (such as a business interest under a buy–sell agreement) shall be determined without regard to any option, agreement, or other right to acquire or use the property at a price less than the fair market value of the property, or any restriction on the right to sell or use the property, unless the option, agreement, right, or restriction meets three requirements. These requirements are that it is a bona fide business arrangement, it is not a device to transfer such property to objects of the decedent's bounty for less than full and adequate consideration, and its terms are comparable to similar arrangements entered into by persons in an arm's-length transaction.

By regulation, the IRS has ruled that these statutory requirements do not apply to agreements among unrelated parties. Furthermore, agreements already in existence on October 8, 1990, are grandfathered, and these statutory requirements do not apply to them unless they are "substantially modified" after October 8, 1990. However, the former common-law rules still apply in all situations. These common-law rules generally involve the first two statutory rules, as well as requiring a written agreement that sets a determinable price, which also applies to sales during life (i.e., a first-offer commitment).

Therefore, if the parties wish the value set for a business interest in a buy–sell agreement to fix the value of the interest for federal estate tax purposes (as they normally do), the statutory requirements of Section 2703 of Chapter 14 must be met, unless the agreement is grandfathered or is among unrelated parties, or is otherwise excepted, in which case, the common-law rules still must be met.

## **Retention of Business Interests**

## **Should a Business Interest Be Sold or Retained for the Family?**

When business owners are planning their estates, they have two initial alternatives regarding the fate of the business. One plan may be to dispose of the business interest entirely during their lifetime or upon their death or retirement. Another may be to arrange for its retention in the family.

Retention may be practical when the family owns a majority interest, when some member of the family is interested in the business and is capable of managing it successfully, when the outlook for the business is promising, and when there are other assets in the owner's estate, including perhaps existing or new life insurance. This way, the owner can arrange adequate liquidity for his or her estate and equalize the distribution of the estate among those heirs who will receive a business interest and those who will not. If these elements are missing, the business owner should carefully consider whether to attempt retention.

### **Estate Liquidity through Section 303 Redemptions**

A number of approaches that may facilitate retention have already been covered elsewhere in this book. However, one other approach is the Section 303 redemption. When certain conditions are met, Section 303 of the IRC allows a corporation to redeem sufficient stock from a deceased stockholder's estate or heirs to pay death taxes, funeral costs, and estate administration expenses without creating a taxable dividend to the estate or heirs. The proceeds received under a Section 303 redemption need not actually be used for meeting these death expenses. Section 303 merely sets a limit on the amount that can be received from a partial redemption of stock before it may be considered a taxable dividend. Thus, under the proper circumstances, Section 303 can be an attractive way to get cash out of a closely held corporation upon the death of a stockholder without danger of an income tax liability.

To qualify for a Section 303 redemption, the value of a deceased stockholder's stock in the corporation must comprise more than 35 percent of his or her adjusted gross estate. Assume, for example, the following estate situation for a divorced business owner:

| Gross estate                              | \$4,400,000 |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Minus: Assumed debts, funeral, and estate |             |
| administration expenses                   | –400,000    |
| Adjusted gross estate                     | \$4,000,000 |

In this case, if the deceased stockholder owned stock in the corporation valued at \$2,000,000, the estate would be eligible for a Section 303 redemption because 35 percent of the adjusted gross estate in this case is \$1,400,000 and so the \$2,000,000 stock interest qualifies. So assuming \$40,000 for funeral and estate administration expenses and combined federal and state death taxes of \$300,000, this estate could offer for redemption a total of \$500,000 (\$200,000 \$300,000) of stock to the corporation without its being considered a taxable dividend.

However, stock qualifying for a Section 303 redemption and, hence, protecting the proceeds of a redemption from tax treatment as ordinary dividend income is limited to stock redeemed from a stockholder whose interest is reduced directly by the payment of death taxes, funeral expenses, or administration expenses. Hence, some stockholders may not be able to take advantage of Section 303. Life insurance owned by the corporation may be used to finance a Section 303 redemption.
