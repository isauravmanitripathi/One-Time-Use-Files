Making lifetime gifts is an important estate planning strategy. There are tax and nontax advantages for doing so. However, lifetime giving is not an unmixed blessing, and there are limitations and caveats that should be considered. Certain methods of selling property to family members and loans to family members also are described in this chapter.

## **Making Lifetime (Inter Vivos) Gifts to Noncharitable Donees Advantages of Lifetime Gifts**

Lifetime gifts can be an attractive estate tax-saving (and GST tax-saving) technique under the right conditions. They can have the following advantages over bequeathing property at death.

**No Tax on Annual Exclusion Gifts** Amounts within the per-donee gift tax annual exclusion and unlimited exclusion for direct payments of tuition and medical expenses will escape gift taxation and will not be in the donor's gross estate. Similar outright transfers also will avoid the GST tax; transfers in trust may do so if they meet the requirements for such trusts. Much property can escape all transfer taxation this way.

**Post-Gift Appreciation Escapes Taxation** Future appreciation in the value of gift property will escape taxation in the donor's estate.

**Shifting Income from Gift Property** Taxable income and realized and recognized capital gains from gift property will be transferred to the donee for income tax purposes.

**Reduced Probate Costs** Estate administration expenses, which generally are based on the probate estate, will be reduced.

**Reduced State Death Taxes** Similarly, state death taxes can be saved.

**Any Gift Taxes Paid Are Removed from the Gross Estate** For gifts made more than three years before death, gift taxes paid by the donor are not in the donor's gross estate at death. On the other hand, if the estate and GST taxes should be repealed, or if the estate should be less than the exemption amounts at death any gift taxes paid would not reduce any estate or GST taxes. In effect, any gift taxes actually paid would be a loss to the estate owner and his or her heirs in these unlikely situations.

**Gift Taxes Are Tax-Exclusive, While Estate Taxes Are Tax-Inclusive** This is really another way of making the previous point. The idea is that the gift tax is paid by the donor and the full gift goes to the donee (tax-exclusive), while the estate tax is paid by the executor on the full taxable estate, with only the balance going to the heirs (tax-inclusive). In effect, estate tax is paid on the tax itself, while this is not so with the gift tax.

**Valuation Discounts May Be Taken in Certain Cases** The valuation discounts described in Chapter 26 may be available, depending on the circumstances. Of course, valuation discounts also can be taken for federal estate tax purposes, but they are commonly associated with lifetime gifts.

**Nontax Personal Advantages** Finally, donors can enjoy all the personal and family advantages of their generosity during their lifetimes. Also, donees can receive the gift property now when it might be needed the most. The importance of such nontax factors depends on individual circumstances. These might include the age and health of the donor; the size of the estate; the ages, educational and other needs, and marital statuses of potential donees; and other personal considerations.

## **Limitations and Caveats Concerning Lifetime Gifts**

**No One Knows What the Future May Hold** Donors should be careful that they can do without the gift property, particularly during retirement. What if their health deteriorates? What if they find themselves in an expensive custodial care situation without adequate LTC insurance? What if the stock market plummets? What if interest rates decline or rise precipitously? What if some present source or sources of income should dry up in the event of career difficulties or economic recession, or even depression?

**Uncertainties Created by EGTRRA and Potential Transfer Tax Reform** Given the uncertain future structure of the transfer tax system, longer applicable exclusion amounts for the estate tax but a level \$1,000,000 excluded amount for the gift tax, and uncertain maximum transfer tax rates in general, it can be argued that it is better planning to "pay no tax before its time."

**Marital Situations** If donors are considering giving assets to their spouses, what would happen if they separated, divorced, or stayed together and had marital difficulties? In some cases, this may be an issue; in others, not. Similarly, the marital situation of other potential donees (e.g., children) may affect how and when gifts may be made to them. For example, one normally would not want a portion of gift property to end up in the hands of a donee's ex-spouse (such as, for example, in the form of commingled marital property).

**Liquidity Considerations** Donors should be careful about giving away liquid assets if their estates may have liquidity problems. On the other hand, there are various planning techniques for providing liquidity to an estate. In addition, owners of closely held business interests who are planning to have their estates take advantage of tax provisions, such as Section 6166 or Section 303, should take care that they do not give away so much of their closely held stock or other business interest that their estates cannot qualify for these favorable provisions.

**Control Considerations** Owners of closely held corporation stock (or other business interests) should consider whether they are impairing their control over the corporation by gifts of stock. Sometimes, a controlling owner wants to relinquish control to family members during his or her lifetime; however, often he or she does not.

**Personal Impact on Donees** Some family members actually may be harmed by having control over too much property too soon—or even ever. This is an individual matter and depends on the personalities and characters of the people involved. Also, in making gifts to minors, it is difficult to know what kind of people they will grow up to be or whom they may marry.

**Gift Taxes May Have to Be Paid Now** This may be true for larger gifts that exceed available exclusions and use up the gift tax unified credit. Actual payment of gift taxes not only involves the uncertainties already mentioned, but also results in loss of the time value of money on the gift tax paid.

**Postgift Depreciation May Enhance Taxation** Obviously, the advantage of removal of postgift appreciation from the gross estate applies only if there is appreciation. If the value of gifted property declines, gift tax will have been paid or unified credit used at a value greater than was removed from the gross estate.

**No Step-up in Basis at Death for Gift Property** Hence, the donee loses the present step-up in basis at death and may face larger capital gains (or lower capital losses) on a subsequent sale or exchange of the property. However, the impact of this issue may depend on many factors, including what the donee does with the gift property, the age of the donor, and the relationship between estate tax and capital gains tax rates.

### **Some Observations on Lifetime Gifts**

Commentators have suggested that in this uncertain tax environment people who normally would be making lifetime gifts for all the reasons previously noted should continue to do so. However, this generally should be done without actually incurring gift taxes. Thus, gifts within the annual exclusion and tuition and medical exclusions can be made. Transfer techniques that do not result in any taxable gifts at all also are possibilities. These include "zeroed out" GRATs, sales to defective grantor trusts, intrafamily loans, and self-canceling installment notes, and are discussed later in this chapter. Finally, gifts made at a "discount," hopefully within the gift tax applicable exclusion amount, such as QPRTs, and also gifts of FLPs, may be logical strategies.

#### **Gifts to Minors—General Considerations**

People frequently want to make gifts to minors—children or grandchildren, for example. Because the donees are minors and, hence, usually cannot deal with the property during their minority (generally until age 18), special arrangements often are made for such gifts. Donors also may want to defer control over gift property until younger donees reach an age when it is presumed they will be more mature and experienced in managing money. Finally, some donors want to skip generations with such gifts.

#### **Methods for Making Gifts to Minors**

**Outright Gifts** Some kinds of property may conveniently be given outright to minors, such as savings accounts, U.S. series EE savings bonds, and life insurance on the minor's life. However, outright gifts of other kinds of property may cause problems because outsiders normally are not willing to deal with minors in managing the property, since minors generally are not legally competent to contract. Of course, a legal guardian could be appointed for minors, but guardianship tends to be inflexible and expensive, and donors generally prefer other methods. Therefore, outright gifts are not really a practical method for structuring substantial, long-term giving programs for minors.

**Uniform Transfers (Gifts) to Minors Act** The UTMA or the original UGMA is a popular way to make gifts of securities and other property to minors. Laws of this type have been enacted in all states and the District of Columbia. In general, they provide for the registration of securities and brokerage accounts, life insurance policies, annuity contracts, mutual funds, money market accounts, and other investments a "prudent person" would make1 in the name of an adult to act as custodian of the property for the minor. As an example, a father might give stock to his minor son, with the boy's adult aunt named as custodian for the minor-donee under the particular state's UTMA.

This arrangement technically creates a custodianship, not a trust. The custodianship operates according to the terms of the state law under which it was created, and the donor cannot change those terms. The gift property is held by the custodian, who manages, invests, and reinvests it for the minor's benefit. The custodian can apply the property or the income from it for the benefit of the minor (including for educational expenses) or accumulate it in the custodian's sole discretion. To the extent that the property and income

1The former UGMA limited eligible assets to a specific list, such as securities, life insurance and annuity contracts, and money.

are not expended for the minor's benefit, they must be delivered or paid over to the minor when he or she reaches majority, which generally is specified in the law to be age 21. If the minor dies before attaining majority, the property and income must go to his or her estate. Thus, a possible disadvantage of this method is the forced distribution of the property and accumulated income to the former minor at majority.

The UTMA simplifies making gifts to minors. No formal trust agreement is required. Income and capital gains are taxable to the minor, unless the income is used to satisfy a legal obligation to support the minor. Also, the donor gets full use of the gift tax annual exclusion, even though the custodian may accumulate income for the minor. Thus, to continue the previous example, if a father gave \$13,000 worth of stock to his son in 2009 under his state's UTMA, all \$13,000 would qualify for the gift tax annual exclusion and no taxable gift would result. Also, the gift property would be removed from the donor's gross estate. However, if the donor acts as custodian and dies before the minor reaches majority, the property will be in the donor's gross estate because the donor-custodian will have made a transfer with a retained power to alter or amend the enjoyment of the transferred property (see Chapter 26).

**Trusts for Minors Under Section 2503(c)** Under this section of the code, a donor can have full use of the annual exclusion for gifts to a minor in trust. Thus, if a father transfers \$13,000 of stock in 2009 to an irrevocable trust with his minor son as beneficiary and the trust meets the requirements of Section 2503(c), the full \$13,000 will qualify for the annual exclusion.

To receive this treatment, Section 2503(c) requires that trust income and principal may be expended by the trustee for or on behalf of the beneficiary until the minor reaches age 21. Second, any amounts remaining in the trust when the beneficiary becomes 21 must be distributed or made available to the beneficiary at that time. This may be a disadvantage because donors may prefer to postpone distribution until after age 21 or perhaps in installments, such as one-third at 25, one-third at 30, and the final third at 35.

It is permissible for the trust itself to continue beyond age 21, provided the beneficiary has the power (even for only a limited period) to obtain outright the property and any accumulated income in the trust at majority. The trust terms might give the beneficiary such a right for a brief period after the beneficiary turns age 21, in the hope that he or she may not exercise it, and then the irrevocable trust can continue for whatever period the original grantor specified in the terms of the trust. (This is not possible for UTMA gifts.) Third, if the beneficiary dies prior to age 21, the trust property must go to the beneficiary's estate or as the beneficiary designates. The gift property normally will be removed from the donor's gross estate.

Again, however, the grantor (donor) should not be a trustee because the same estate tax principle applies here as under UTMA gifts, since the trustee must have discretionary power to expend trust corpus or income for the minor's benefit before age 21. After age 21, the trust terms may be different if the trust continues. Income and capital gains from these trusts are taxable to the trust for federal income tax purposes, if accumulated, and to the beneficiary, if distributed to him or her.2

**Use of Regular Trusts** Gifts can be made to minors through regular irrevocable trusts, sometimes called Section 2503(b) trusts, the same as they can to anyone else. Trusts enable the grantor-donor to set the terms of the gift within the rules of the state's trust law. A trust other than a Section 2503(c) trust does not have to make the corpus available when a beneficiary reaches majority or even, in many cases, for many years (or even generations) thereafter. Donors often want to use long-term (or even generation-skipping) trusts when planning for a substantial lifetime giving program.

The practical problems are that a formal trust must be established and, depending on the size of the gift and terms of the trust, the donor may not be able to take full advantage of the gift tax annual exclusion. This is because, without a so-called Crummey power (described next), only a part or none of each gift to the trust will be considered a gift of a present interest to the donee (the trust beneficiary or beneficiaries), and only a present interest will qualify for the annual exclusion.

If the terms of a trust call for the accumulation of trust income or for discretion by the trustee in paying trust income to or for one or more beneficiaries (e.g., a sprinkle or spray power), no part of a gift to the trust would be a present interest to any specific beneficiary. If a trust requires the current distribution of its income to a trust beneficiary or beneficiaries, only a part of each gift would be a gift of a present interest (measured by the part representing the mandatory income interest), and the remainder would be a future interest. This was illustrated in Chapter 25. However, a mandatory income requirement may not be suitable for long-term trusts for minors. Also, it means that the \$13,000 in 2009 (indexed for inflation) annual exclusion will never be able to shelter the entire annual gifts to the trust.

<sup>2</sup> If trust income is accumulated and taxable to the trust, the kiddie tax on unearned income of minors age 18 or under, or of students under age 24 will not apply. The kiddie tax would apply to UTMA gifts for minors since custodianship income is taxed to the minor. Note also that trust income used to discharge a legal obligation to support a minor may be taxed to the person with that obligation.

**Regular (Section 2503[b]) Trusts with Crummey Powers** The famous Crummey case3 and its eventual acceptance by the IRS gave estate planners a possible solution to the problems of making gifts in trust so that the whole gift (up to certain limits) will be a gift of a present interest and hence qualify for the annual exclusion. This solution involves having a *Crummey power* in these trusts.

The terms of an irrevocable trust may give the trust beneficiary or each beneficiary (no matter how young) the noncumulative right each year to withdraw his or her pro rata share of that year's gift to the trust up to an amount equal to the annual exclusion; or an amount equal to twice the annual exclusion if gift splitting is contemplated. This right to withdraw normally is available for only a brief period during the year, such as 30 days.

This withdrawal right is a Crummey power and is intended to assure an annual exclusion for each year's gift to the trust up to the limit for each beneficiary with a Crummey power. This is because each beneficiary can get the immediate possession, use, or enjoyment of his or her share of the gift by withdrawing it. However, even though the purpose of a Crummey power is to get the annual exclusion for the grantor, it must be a real power and not just illusory. Thus, the powerholder(s)—trust beneficiary or beneficiaries must actually possess the withdrawal right for a reasonable period (often 30 days), must be notified of it, and there must be assets in the trust with which to satisfy the power if it were to be exercised.

Technically, Crummey withdrawal rights are general powers of appointment over the property subject to withdrawal. If these rights are not exercised during the limited withdrawal period and are noncumulative, it represents the lapse in that year of a general power of appointment over the property subject to withdrawal. These might be called *annually lapsing powers.* The tax code provides that lapses of general powers each year for each beneficiary that do not exceed the larger of \$5,000 or 5 percent of the value of the property from which the powers could have been exercised are not a *release* of the powers, which might be a taxable event. The amount covered by this so-called 5 and 5 power is often referred to as the *lapse protected amount,* and lapses within this amount will not give rise to any gift or estate tax consequences for the powerholder. However, lapses in a year for a powerholder (e.g., beneficiary) that exceed the larger of \$5,000 or 5 percent of corpus are considered *releases* of a general power of appointment, and may give rise to

<sup>3</sup> Since Crummey powers are so commonly used and widely discussed in estate planning, the citation for the Crummey case is *Crummey v. Commissioner,* 397 F.2d 82 (9th Cir. 1968), rev 'g 25 T.C.M. 772 (1966).

#### **Lifetime Giving and Other Intrafamily Techniques 637**

taxable gifts by the powerholder to other trust beneficiaries and inclusion of corpus in the powerholder's gross estate upon his or her death, depending on the terms of the trust.

One planning approach to this issue is to limit the annual amount of the Crummey power to the \$5,000 or 5 percent of corpus lapse potential amount even though it may be less than the annual exclusion. Another approach is not to limit the Crummey power (thus getting the full annual exclusion), but with the gift and estate tax issues just noted. The gift tax issue can be solved by giving the powerholder a testimentory power of appointment over the excess lapsed amount, but he estate tax issue remains. Also, if the withdrawal rights are cumulative over the duration of the trust and do not lapse if not exercised within the limited withdrawal period (other than lapsing to the extent of the greater of \$5,000 or 5 percent of corpus each year), they are called *hanging powers*. Here the full annual exclusion will also be available each year, but the excess withdrawal right will remain with the beneficiaries. Such powers may be suggested by some planners.

Thus, regular irrevocable trusts with Crummey powers may produce some attractive results. They can result in shifting or accumulating trust income for income tax purposes, in removing trust property from the donor's gross estate for estate tax purposes, and normally in no taxable gifts being made because of the gift tax annual exclusion. The trustee also can be given discretionary power to distribute income and corpus to the beneficiaries, subject to an ascertainable standard or at an independent trustee's sole discretion. Thus, funds could be provided for the beneficiaries' educational needs or other needs. Finally, such trusts can continue for many years after the beneficiaries reach majority—or even for the beneficiaries' lifetimes, depending on the desires of the creator of the trust. Thus, they could be generationskipping trusts if a trust meets the requirements for a GST annual exclusion trust or if the grantor allocates enough of his or her GST exemption to the trust to make it exempt.

**Income Tax Considerations** Trust income or income from property held for a minor under a UTMA that is used to discharge a parent's legal obligation to support the minor will be taxed to the parent. What a parent's support obligation is in a given case depends on the law of the state in which they live and may vary with the circumstances of the parents.

#### **Gifts Between Spouses**

There is an unlimited federal gift tax marital deduction for qualifying gifts between spouses (when the donee spouse is a U.S. citizen). Thus, gifts between spouses are gift tax–free.

#### **Gifts of Remainder Interests with Retained Use or Income Interests**

We saw in Chapter 26 that Chapter 14 of the IRC effectively restricts gifts in trust of remainder interests to family members, with the retention of interests in the trust by the transferor (donor) to the following types of transfers.

**Personal Residence Trusts (PRTs)** These are irrevocable trusts under which the grantor transfers one personal residence to the trust and retains the right to use and occupy the residence for a period of years, and at the end of this period the residence goes to a remainderperson. In the case of a PRT, the trust cannot hold any other assets and the residence cannot be sold during the term. As a result, PRTs are inflexible and normally QPRTs are used.

**Qualified Personal Residence Trusts (QPRTs)** These are irrevocable trusts under which the grantor transfers one personal residence per trust (either a principal residence or one other residence of the grantor) to the trust, retains a term interest in the trust (i.e., the right to use or occupy the residence for a period of years), and grants a remainder interest in the trust to a family member or members at the end of the term period. In effect, the grantor is giving away his or her personal residence to family members but retaining the right to live in it for a fixed period of years.

The purpose is to give away the residence and hopefully get it out of the grantor's gross estate at a reduced gift tax value. The gift tax value is the fair market value of the residence minus both the value of the retained-use interest for the term of years selected, calculated according to the Section 7520 rates, and the actuarial value of a contingent reversionary interest in the event the grantor dies during the term of years that is usually retained by the grantor. Also, any postgift appreciation in the value of the residence is removed from the grantor's gross estate. The result is a substantially reduced transfer tax cost of moving the residence to family members (e.g., children), but still allowing the grantor to use the residence for the term period (and even beyond, with proper planning).

The grantor retains the right to use and occupy the personal residence for a period of years (the term interest), such as 10 or 15 years. The longer the period selected, the greater will be the value of the retained term interest and the smaller will be the taxable gift remainder interest. However, if the grantor dies during the term period, the full value of the property will be in his or her gross estate as a transfer with a retained interest that did not in fact end before his or her death. Therefore, the period selected normally is one that the grantor reasonably expects to survive. This, of course, can never be known for sure. Grantors often also retain the power in their will to direct how the QPRT property will be distributed (or it may revert to his or her probate estate) in the event of the grantor's death before the end of the term period. This is a contingent reversionary interest, which has an actuarial value that also reduces the value of the taxable gift.4 To get the full tax benefits of a QPRT, the grantor must survive the term period. However, even if he or she does not, the grantor would appear to be in no worse position than he or she would have been had no QPRT been created in the first place and the homeowner had simply lived in the residence until his or her death.

Assuming the grantor survives the term period, the residence will pass to the QPRT's remainder beneficiary or beneficiaries or continue in trust for them. If the grantor wants to continue to live in the residence after the term period ends, the grantor can negotiate a lease for the residence from the remainderperson, or from the trustee of a continuing trust for the remainderperson, at a fair market rental. As a planning matter, it usually is an attractive technique to provide that the residence will remain in a continuing irrevocable grantor trust for the remainderperson after the term period ends. This way, lease payments by the grantor will not be taxable income to the remainderperson (since it is a grantor trust for income tax purposes), will not be gifts (assuming they reflect fair market rental value), and in effect will be removed from the grantor's gross estate at his or her death.5

The main disadvantage of QPRTs is that the family member remainderperson(s) does not get a stepped-up income tax basis in the residence at the grantor's death.

**An Illustration of a QPRT** Assume that Alexia Lee-Smith, age 65, owns in her name a condominium apartment as her principal residence worth \$500,000 and a second residence in the country with a value of \$300,000. Alexia has paid off the mortgages on both residences. Her basis in the apartment is \$100,000 and in the country home is \$125,000. Over the years, these properties have increased in value at an average annual compound rate of about 5 percent. Alexia is married and she has a 30-year-old daughter, D. Alexia and her husband are estimated to be in the top federal estate tax bracket, and

<sup>4</sup>Technically, such a contingent reversionary interest also reduces the value of a fixed-term interest (say, for 10 years), since now the interest is for the shorter of the grantor's life or the fixed period. However, the combined value of the term interest and the contingent reversion will be substantially larger than the value of a fixed-term interest alone. Retention of contingent reversionary interests is permitted for QPRTs and PRTs, but not for qualified interests (e.g., GRATs).

<sup>5</sup>As explained in Chapter 10, such a *defective grantor trust* is an irrevocable trust where the grantor is treated as owner of the trust corpus for income tax purposes, but not for estate tax purposes.

neither has made any prior taxable gifts. They would like to continue to use the residences until they die.

Assume, Alexia places each of these residences in a separate QPRT with the irrevocable grantor trusts continuing for D as remainderpersons. Under these QPRTs, Alexia retains the right to use the residences for 10 years (or until her prior death) and further retains the right to direct in her will how the residences will pass in the event of her death during the 10-year period. Alexia further agrees with the trustee that she will be able to lease either or both of the residences at fair market rental value following the 10-year term. During the 10-year period, Alexia will make additional cash contributions to the QPRTs to pay expenses of the properties (real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance expenses, etc.).

Under these facts, and assuming the applicable Section 7520 rate and actuarial value, Alexia will have has made the following combined taxable gifts of the remainder interests:

| Value of the residences                                  | \$800,000 |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Value of 10-year retained term interests                 | –351,520  |
| Value of contingent reversions                           | –148,880  |
| Taxable transfer and gift (value of remainder interests) | \$299,600 |
| Tentative gift tax                                       | \$87,664  |
| Applicable credit amount (unified credit) used           |           |
| (out of a total of \$345,800                             | –87,664   |
| Federal gift tax payable                                 | \$0       |

On the other hand, if Alexia simply retains ownership of these residences until her death (say, at age 80) and the properties continue to appreciate at an average annual compound rate of 5 percent, they will be valued in her gross estate at about \$1,663,000.6

**Grantor-Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)** A GRAT is an irrevocable trust that pays a fixed amount (either a dollar amount or a fixed percentage of the initial fair market value of the property transferred to the GRAT) to the grantor for a specified period (the annuity period). Then the remaining trust corpus is distributed to designated trust beneficiaries (normally family members) or to trusts for them as remainderperson(s). The annuity period normally is for a specified term of years. If the grantor dies during the annuity period, any remaining payments are made to his or her estate or possibly to his or her spouse. Since GRATs are qualified interests under Section 2702, the value of the annuity payments is determined by using Section 7520 rates, rather than being valued at zero. GRATs can be funded with any kind of

<sup>6</sup>Of course, if Alexia's husband survives her, her estate can take a marital deduction, but then the value ultimately will be in her husband's taxable estate.

property, often with marketable securities, real estate, closely held stock, and partnership interests, among others. GRATs normally are grantor trusts.

When a GRAT is created, the taxable gift, if any, is measured by the fair market value of the property placed in the trust minus the value of the grantor's retained annuity interest. Thus, the greater the annuity payout selected, the higher will be the value of the retained interest, and the lower the gift tax value. In fact, it is possible today to set the annuity payments high enough so that at the creation of the GRAT, the actuarial value of the remainder interest, and hence the gift tax value, would be zero or, to be conservative, very low. This is referred to as "zeroing-out a GRAT." Such GRATs are often called "Walton GRATs" after the case that allowed it.

However, the annuity payments come back to the grantor and potentially add to his or her gross estate. If the grantor survives the annuity period, any remaining property in the GRAT is removed from his or her gross estate at no gift tax cost. On the other hand, if the grantor dies during the annuity period, the GRAT corpus will be partly or wholly in his or her gross estate. Thus, as in the case of the QPRT, the annuity period normally is selected with the expectation that the grantor will survive it. Since GRATs normally are wholly grantor trusts for income tax purposes, the grantor is taxed on the income of the trust, but is not taxed on the annuity payments.

The economics of GRATs are largely an investment play. If the total return on the assets in a GRAT exceeds the Section 7520 rate used in calculating the annuity interests (sometimes called the "hurdle rate"), the GRAT will benefit the grantor's family (remainderpersons). Thus, GRATs often are funded with hopefully rapidly appreciating or high-yielding assets. If total return of the GRAT is about the same or less than the Section 7520 rate, it will be essentially a wash. Thus, assuming a "zeroed-out GRAT," even if the total return should fall below the Section 7520 rate (or be negative), the annuity payments will simply exhaust the GRAT corpus and nothing will pass to the remainderpersons. However, even in this case, little (i.e., the costs of setting up and administering the GRAT) would be lost, since the grantor would simply get his or her property back without having made a taxable gift.7 Thus, "zeroed-out GRATs" can be attractive, particularly considering the current transfer-tax uncertainties.

<sup>7</sup> In the Walton case, in 1993, Mrs. Audrey Walton transferred more than \$100 million of Wal-Mart stock to each of two GRATs (more than \$200 million in all). The GRATs were for a two-year term, with annuity payments to Mrs. Walton of 49.35 percent of the initial trust corpus the first year and 59.22 percent in the second. At the end of the two-year term, any assets in the GRATs would go to Mrs. Walton's daughters. If Mrs. Walton died during the two-year term, any remaining annuity payments would be made to her estate. These annuity payments were intended to "zero-out" these GRATs. The IRS contended the GRATs could not be "zeroed-out" and that a taxable gift was made by Mrs. Walton. The tax court

**An Illustration of a Zeroed-out GRAT** Suppose John Markowitz, age 65 and in good health, has a sizable estate and owns a large amount of his employer's stock, which has had good growth over the years. John decides to transfer \$750,000 of this stock to an irrevocable trust (a GRAT) that will pay him an annuity of \$106,783 per year for 10 years. If John should die during the 10-year term, the remaining annuity payments would go to his estate. At the end of this annuity period, the trust corpus is required to be paid to his son, Harry. Furthermore, assume the total return on the common stock averages 10 percent per year over the 10-year period and the Section 7520 rate ("hurdle rate") was 7 percent when the trust was created.

Given the Section 7520 rate of 7 percent, the \$106,783 annuity payment will be just enough to cause the actuarial value of the remainder interest (to Harry) at creation of the GRAT to equal zero (or be "zeroed-out"). Therefore, there will be no taxable gift at creation of the GRAT. However, the GRAT's corpus (the common stock) actually produces a 10 percent total return (3 percentage points over the theoretical Section 7520 rate).8 Therefore, when the 10-year annuity period ends, there actually will be about \$243,463 in the GRAT to go to Harry without any transfer tax cost.

**Grantor-Retained Unitrusts (GRUTs)** These are like GRATs, except that the periodic amount to the grantor is expressed as a fixed percentage of the fair market value of the trust assets valued annually.

**Retained Term Interest in Certain Tangible Property** A grantor can retain an interest for a period of years in nondepreciable tangible property (such as paintings, other art objects, and bare land) with the remainder going to a family member. The value of the term interest reduces the value of the gift.

**Use of FLPs or Other Entities in Making Gifts** For many years, property owners have placed assets in various types of entities, such as partnerships, closely held corporations, and, more recently, LLCs, so the assets could be managed in the interest of family members. Various family members may be given ownership interests in the entity, but often, only certain family members control the entity. Limited partnerships (LPs)9 , which are controlled by

9Limited partnerships (LPs) are partnerships with at least one general partner (who has management control over partnership affairs and unlimited liability for partnership debts) and one

unanimously held to the contrary and said that the GRATs effectively could be "zeroed-out." *Est. of Walton v. Comm.,* 115 TC No. 41 (2000). In the actual Walton situation, however, the annuity payments to Mrs. Walton exhausted the GRATs and nothing actually went to her daughters.

<sup>8</sup>As indicated in Chapter 3, in valuing remainder interests, term interests, life estates, and other interests, the IRS in effect assumes the assets behind these interests will earn the Section 7520 rate. In fact, however, they actually may earn more or less than this rate.

one or a few family members and where substantially all the limited partners are family members, commonly called *family limited partnerships* (FLPs), often are employed as such an entity and will be used as the basis of this discussion. However, LLCs10 also are used for this purpose.

**Basic Concepts** FLPs can be used in a number of ways. However, a traditional idea often has been for a senior family member or members (e.g., mother, father, or both) to set up a limited partnership (LP) to which the senior member contributes property (e.g., real estate, closely held business interests, or marketable securities) in return for a general partnership interest and a limited partnership interest. Younger family members may contribute small amounts (e.g., cash) to the LP in return for a small limited partnership interest.11 Thus, once the LP is formed, the senior member (let us say, mother) has a general partnership interest and also a substantial limited partnership interest, while the other partners (let us say, children) have small limited partnership interests. Mother and children in this example own the partnership and are the partners, while the partnership owns the property contributed to it.12 Mother, as general partner, controls the management of the LP. The limited partners lack control and their interests lack marketability because of the nature of limited partnership interests in an LP.

The general partner has unlimited liability for partnership debts, including tort liability. However, while one or more individuals can be the general partner (mother in our example), the general partner also could be another flow-through entity (such as an S corporation or a limited liability company)

11To be a partnership, an entity must have at least two partners; in an LP, at least one must be a general partner.

12Thus, the partners (mother and children in this example) own partnership interests that have values, and the partnership itself owns the assets inside the partnership, which also have values. The value of a partner's partnership interest is affected not only by his or her pro rata share of the net fair market value of the assets inside the partnership (i.e., liquidation value), but also by the partner's rights and obligations under the partnership agreement. These rights and obligations determine the ability of partners to reap the benefits of the partnership's assets and operations. Thus, the value of the partnership interests of limited partners in an FLP normally will be considerably less than their pro rata share of the net fair market value of partnership assets because of restrictions or limits on the ability of limited partners to control partnership affairs and to dispose of their interests.

or more limited partners (who do not have management control but have limited for partnership debts) and which are established under state law and registered as such. These and other forms of business organization are described in Chapter 31.

<sup>10</sup>Limited liability companies (LLCs) are a newer form of business organization created under state law. All states now have LLC statutes. These are a cross between corporations and partnerships. They are pass-through entities for income tax purposes (like partnerships), but give their members (owners) limited liability and management control (if desired) like corporations. They have become popular as a form of business entity.

owned by an individual (or individuals) or a combination of individuals and a flow-through entity so that no one person would have a controlling interest.13 Such flow-through entities (see Chapter 31) generally will protect an individual owner of the entity from personal liability beyond his or her investment in the entity.

If the partners—usually senior family members—contribute appreciated property to the partnership, there is no capital gain on the exchange of the property for partnership interests. Instead, the contributing partner gets a carryover basis in his or her partnership interest.

After an FLP is formed, the senior family members normally make gifts of some or all of their limited partnership interest to younger family members or to trusts for their benefit. The value of these gift LP interests generally is substantially discounted from the pro rata value of the partnership assets underlying those interests.

**Purposes of FLPs** FLPs can have a number of tax and nontax purposes, such as the following.

*Management of Family Assets:* The general partner (or managing member of an LLC) has control over the management of partnership assets and thus can centralize and effectively manage family wealth.

*Instruct Younger Family Members in Financial Affairs:* A related purpose may be to provide an opportunity for more experienced family members to involve and educate less experienced family members in business and financial matters.

*Secure Substantial Valuation Discounts for Tax Purposes:* As has been explained in this chapter and in Chapter 26, substantial valuation discounts normally can be taken for gift tax and perhaps estate tax purposes. The discounts are based on lack of control and lack of marketability of limited partnership interests.

*Creditor Protection:* The FLP agreement may restrict the ability of limited partners to assign or pledge their interests as collateral. Also, even if a limited partner's creditors do levy against his or her partnership interest, under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA) (see Chapter 31), generally all a creditor can get is a charging order against the interest. This essentially allows the creditor the right to receive whatever partnership distributions are made to the limited partner (distributions that normally are controlled by the general partner).

13There can be 100 percent owned single-stockholder S corporations. Also, many state laws permit single-member LLCs.

*Protection Against Marital Claims:* In a similar vein, if a limited partner has marital difficulties, normally all the former spouse could receive in a divorce settlement or equitable distribution would be an assignee's interest in the limited partner's interest (or possibly a limited partner's interest), which again would be subject to the general partner's control. Also, an LP interest normally can be easily identified as nonmarital gift property.

**Limitations of FLPs** These arrangements can be complex, with commensurate cost of setting them up. They normally are used for substantial property interests. Also, care should be taken in planning and drafting these agreements so that they do not run afoul of various tax law provisions, thereby causing unwanted tax consequences. Competent legal counsel should be used in drafting them. Finally, it must be recognized that the IRS and others are watching FLPs closely. Hence, care should be taken in establishing these arrangements.

**An Illustration** Let us assume Henry Chang, age 60, owns a profitable apartment house with a net fair market value of \$4 million and an adjusted basis of \$800,000 in his own name. Henry is married to Tracy, age 56, and together they have sizeable gross estates. Neither Henry nor Tracy has made any prior taxable gifts. Henry and Tracy have two adult children and four grandchildren. Henry has decided to make substantial lifetime gifts to his children to help them financially now and to teach them the real estate business, but he would like to keep control of the management of his property. He also wants to keep any sizeable gifts within his and Tracy's applicable exclusion amounts. Tracy is willing to split any lifetime gifts. Therefore, Henry decides to transfer the apartment house to a family limited partnership in exchange for a 1 percent general partnership interest and a 97 percent limited partnership interest. Each of the children contributes a small amount of cash or securities for 1 percent limited partnership interests each.

After the FLP is formed, Henry makes gifts in of 42.08 percent limited partnership interests outright to each of his two children. The value of these gifts is determined by assuming a 20 percent discount for lack of marketability and a 25 percent discount for lack of control taken sequentially. An independent appraisal is secured to determine these discounts.14

<sup>14</sup>The amounts of these discounts may be affected by a variety of factors, such as the terms of the FLP agreement, underlying assets in the FLP (e.g., more for nonliquid assets; less for marketable securities), distribution history of the FLP, and others. Data from published studies and public markets often are used as starting points in determining these discounts.

Therefore, no gift tax is payable, but use of Henry's and Tracy's current gift tax applicable credit amounts (\$345,800 each) have been used.

After these gifts, Henry has a 1 percent general partnership interest and a 15.84 percent limited partnership interest. Thus, due to these substantial valuation discounts, Henry has transferred the underlying value of limited partnership assets of \$1,683,200 (0.4208 × \$4,000,000) to each of his children while staying within his and Tracy's current applicable credit amounts for gift tax purposes. Henry also remains in control of the FLP through his 1 percent general partnership interest.

## **Sales within the Family**

The previous sections in this chapter were concerned with gifts—gratuitous transfers. This section deals with planning techniques where there are sales for full and adequate consideration between family members or between family members and trusts for other family members.

## **Sales to a Defective Grantor Trust**

**Basic Concept** This technique is different in form from a zeroed-out GRAT, but the objective is much the same. In a typical situation, a senior family member sets up (is the grantor of) a so-called defective grantor trust (see Chapter 10), which is a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes (i.e., the corpus is treated as owned by the grantor), but which will not be

#### **Lifetime Giving and Other Intrafamily Techniques 647**

included in the grantor's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes if the grantor dies during its term. The grantor then sells appreciated property to the trust in return for an interest-bearing promissory note that is due at the end of the trust term. At this time, any remaining corpus in the trust (after the principal and interest due on the note is paid to the grantor) will be paid to the trust beneficiaries (normally family members of the grantor).

If the interest rate on the promissory note is at least equal to the appropriate applicable federal rate (AFR),15 and the principal (face) of the note is equal to the value of the property sold to the trust, there is no taxable gift by the grantor from the transaction. It is a sale, not a gift. Also, since the sale is to a grantor trust, there is no gain realized or recognized on the sale of the appreciated property because income tax–wise it is as if the grantor is selling the property to himself or herself. If the grantor should die during the term of the trust, the corpus of the irrevocable trust would not be included in his or her gross estate for federal estate tax purposes, since the grantor has made no gift with a retained interest (as would be true for a GRAT, for example) or kept any other power or right that would cause inclusion. As a practical matter, some planners suggest also having additional property in trusts to avoid possible estate tax issues. However, the value of the promissory note would be in the grantor's gross estate at death.

As with GRATs, sales to defective grantor trusts essentially are an investment play. If the total return on the property sold to the trust exceeds the interest on the promissory note to the grantor (the appropriate AFR), some assets will remain in the trust after the loan and interest are paid, and the trust will benefit the trust beneficiaries without any transfer tax cost. If the total return is equal to or less than the appropriate AFR, nothing will remain in the trust at the end of its term and nothing will go to the grantor's family. But even in this event, nothing really will have been lost by the grantor.

**An Illustration** Assume Paul Olson, age 65 and in good health, has a sizeable estate and would like to benefit his adult son and daughter during his lifetime. However, he does not wish to make any taxable gifts and already is making annual exclusion gifts to them. Paul decides to create an

<sup>15</sup>The AFRs are defined in Section 1274(d) of the IRC. As noted in chapter 3, there are three: the short-term rate for obligations with terms of less than three years, the midterm rate for obligations with terms from three to nine years, and the long-term rate for obligations whose terms exceed nine years. Recall that the Section 7520 rate (used for GRATs and other valuations) is 120 percent of the mid-term AFR. Thus, the AFR used in this situation probably will be less than the Section 7520 rate. (They both are sometimes referred to as "hurdle rates" in the context used here.) This can be an advantage for a sale to a defective grantor trust, as compared with a zeroed-out GRAT.

irrevocable defective grantor trust for a term of 10 years with his two children as beneficiaries. He then sells \$1,200,000 of common stock (for which he paid \$200,000 many years ago) to the trust in return for a \$1,200,000 promissory note bearing 6 percent interest (the long-term AFR) paid annually (or \$72,000 in interest per year to Paul). The principal and any accrued interest on the note are payable to Paul at the end of the trust's 10-year term. Paul has noted that the average annual compound rate of total return on this stock over the last 15 years has been more then 12 percent.

In this transaction, Paul has not realized and recognized any capital gain on the sale, has not made any taxable gift, and the trust corpus will not be in his gross estate if he should die during the 10-year term, all for the reasons just stated. If we assume the stock sold to the trust actually has an average annual compound rate of total return during the 10-year term of 10 percent (i.e., 4 percentage points over the 6 percent "hurdle rate"), approximately \$764,996 worth of stock will remain in the trust after the loan principal and interest have been paid to Paul, and this amount will be distributed to his children at the end of the 10-year term without any transfer tax cost. On the other hand, if the total return is equal to or less than the 6 percent "hurdle rate," nothing will remain in the trust and nothing will go to Paul's children.

#### **Installment Sales**

In this case, the seller disposes of his or her entire interest in eligible property in return for annual payments for a stated period. This is essentially the same as any installment sale (as described in Chapter 10), except it is to a family member. The buyer is obligated to pay the installments when due, whether the seller survives the installment period or not.

## **Self-Canceling Installment Notes (SCINs)**

In this installment arrangement, the seller disposes of his or her entire interest in eligible property in return for annual payments for the shorter of the installment period or the seller's lifetime. In other words, if the seller dies during the installment period, the note is cancelled and no further payments are due to the seller's estate. This eventuality would benefit the buyer, who would be a family member. Also, there would be no value for the note in a deceased seller's gross estate. However, to be considered an installment transaction, the payment term must be less than the seller's life expectancy at the time of sale. Also, to avoid a taxable gift, an adequate premium must be charged for the cancellation feature, usually in the form of a higher sales price, higher interest on the installments, or both.

## **Private Annuity Sales**

Here, the seller disposes of his or her entire interest in the property in return for the buyer's unsecured promise to pay an annual income for the seller's lifetime—hence, the term *private annuity.* It is like a commercial life annuity, except it is provided by a family member rather than an insurance company. Thus, when the seller dies, the annuity payments cease and nothing (except for the previous annuity payments) is his or her gross estate. However, a recent proposed IRS regulation requires taxation of any gain on the property at the time of the sale for the private annuity. Hence, there will be no deferral of gain in the private annuities. This is expected to substantially reduce the use of this strategy.

## **Other Sale Arrangements**

These may include sales of remainder interests for cash, sales of remainder interests for SCINs, and split purchases of property.

## **Loans to Family Members**

This can be another approach to transferring significant wealth to family members without making taxable gifts. In this case, a senior family member might create a defective grantor trust for the benefit of other family members (e.g., children or grandchildren), lend money to the trust, and receive a promissory note from the trust for the loan. The face of the note would equal the amount of the loan, and it would bear interest at the appropriate AFR, so there should be no gift by the grantor. The note is due at the end of the trust's term. If the grantor should die during the term of the trust, the value of the note will be in his or her gross estate, but the corpus of the trust should not be.

As with GRATs and sales to defective grantor trusts, such loan arrangements are an investment play. If the total return on the assets in which the trustee invests the loan proceeds exceeds the "hurdle rate" (the interest rate on the note or AFR rate), some assets will remain in the trust after the loan and interest are paid, and they will go to the trust beneficiaries at the end of the trust's term without any transfer tax cost. However, if the total return is equal to or less than the appropriate AFR rate, nothing will remain in the trust at the end of its term and nothing will go to the beneficiaries. For example, instead of a sale, if Paul Olson in the previous illustration had loaned \$1,200,000 to the defective grantor trust for 10 years at the 6 percent long-term AFR, and the trust assets had earned the assumed 10 percent average annual compound rate of total return, the economic results for his children would be the same as shown in the previous illustration.

Loans also can be made directly to other family members in the hope that their returns on the loan proceeds will exceed the interest they pay. Such loans also can be forgiven (which will be gifts) within the annual exclusion each year or possibly in greater amounts.
