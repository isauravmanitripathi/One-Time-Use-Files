## **Sources of Life Insurance Protection**

These sources can conveniently be broken down into individually purchased policies, employer-sponsored benefits, and government-sponsored coverages.

#### **Individually Purchased Life Insurance**

In this case, the individual applies for and, if found insurable, is issued an individual contract of life insurance. This is the main area in which life insurance planning occurs. In recent years, the average size of individual life insurance policies sold has increased considerably as the uses for life insurance have become more varied and sophisticated and life insurance has been viewed as an efficient wealth transfer vehicle.

#### **Employer-Sponsored Life Insurance**

This coverage is provided through the employer-employee relationship. Most of it is group term life insurance under the employer's benefit plan.

**Group Life Insurance** Group life insurance generally is available with part or all of the cost paid by the employer and generally is issued without individual evidence of insurability. The amount of insurance on individual employees normally is determined by some type of benefit formula.

**Wholesale Life Insurance** This is a hybrid between individual and group life insurance and normally is used for groups too small to qualify for group coverage. An individual policy is issued to each covered person in the group, and there may be some individual underwriting.

**Group Universal Life Insurance** This is a group, employee-pay-all version of individual UL or individual VUL insurance.1

<sup>1</sup> Individual UL and VUL insurance are described in greater detail later in this chapter.

#### **Federal Government Life Programs**

Although not normally thought of as life insurance, Social Security provides survivorship benefits, which, in essence, represent significant death benefits. These survivorship benefits are described next. At various times, the federal government has issued or arranged for life insurance for persons serving in the armed forces.

## **Social Security Survivorship (Death) Benefits**

The overall structure of Social Security benefits and the Social Security system was described in Chapter 13 in connection with retirement planning. The focus of this chapter is on the survivorship (death) benefits to certain survivors of deceased actively employed workers, disabled workers, or retired workers. These survivorship benefits are based on the covered worker's PIA and are paid in the form of monthly income to the eligible family member.

**Surviving Spouse** The surviving spouse of fully insured worker can receive a survivor's benefit, provided the surviving spouse is age 60 or older or is disabled and at least age 50. The amount of this benefit is 100 percent of the deceased worker's survivor PIA, if the surviving spouse has reached the full-benefit retirement age. The benefit is reduced for eligible younger widows or widowers. Furthermore, a surviving divorced spouse who had been married to the deceased worker for at least 10 consecutive years, or who has an eligible child in his or her care, may be eligible for a survivor's benefit in generally the same manner as a surviving spouse.

**Other Dependents** An *unmarried child* (and, in certain circumstances, an unmarried grandchild) of a deceased worker (who might have been actively employed, disabled, or retired at the time of his or her death) is entitled to a child's monthly survivor's benefit. This benefit is equal to 75 percent of the deceased parent's PIA, provided the child is under age 18, or is under age 19 and an elementary or secondary school student, or is 18 or older but became disabled before age 22.

In addition, the surviving spouse of a deceased worker is eligible for a *mother's or father's survivor's benefit* equal to 75 percent of the deceased worker's PIA as long as the surviving spouse is caring for an eligible child who is under age 16, or is age 16 or older if the child was disabled before reaching age 22. The surviving spouse is eligible for this benefit at any age. A surviving divorced spouse also may be eligible for this benefit. Furthermore, a surviving *dependent parent* who is at least 62 years old may be entitled to a monthly survivor's benefit.

As is the case for other Social Security benefits, there is a family maximum benefit (FMB) that applies to the combined survivors' benefits from the PIA of a deceased worker.

## **Types of Individual Life Insurance Contracts**

In the past, there were three traditional types of individual life insurance contracts: term, whole life, and endowment. However, in recent years, a number of newer types have been developed and they have increased greatly in their complexity.

Assuming a person needs individual life insurance, one of the fundamental issues that must be decided is what type or types of contracts to purchase and from which insurance company or companies to purchase them. However, in making this choice, the consumer really has to make decisions on several underlying issues.

The first is whether to rely largely or entirely on term life insurance for his or her insurance needs. If so, presumably the person will look to nonâ€“life insurance investment media for his or her investment or savings needs and may not purchase much, if any, life insurance that accumulates a cash value. A problem with this approach is that the cost of term insurance will increase with age (and rapidly at the older ages) and so at some point the policyowner may be tempted to discontinue (lapse) the term insurance. Of course, the person by then may have accumulated an investment fund outside of the life insurance. In any event, term insurance probably is best thought of as a way of meeting *temporary* needs for life insurance, rather than providing life insurance over the insured's entire lifetime.

On the other hand, if the person wants a more or less level premium for the life insurance and thus is interested in developing a cash value (in effect, an investment element) as part of the life insurance contract, he or she should consider one or more of the various types of cash-value or permanent life insurance for part or all of his or her insurance portfolio. This is the longstanding "term or cash-value" debate. Actually, many people resolve this issue by using term insurance for shorter-term protection needs and also cash-value contracts to meet their long-term life insurance needs. This is a more diversified approach.

Assuming at least some cash-value life insurance is to be purchased, the next underlying issue is to decide who is to make the investment decisions and bear the investment risks with regard to the cash value. In this regard, one choice would be to buy life insurance in which the cash value is guaranteed as to a principal amount and a minimum rate of return by the insurance company (which might be termed a *guaranteed-dollar* or *fixed-dollar* policy) and for which the investment decisions and risks fall on the insurance company. The other choice would be life insurance in which the investment of the cash value is decided upon by the policyowner from among the subaccounts (investment funds) available under the policy (variable life insurance), and thus where the investment decisions and risks inherent in the accounts fall on the policyowner.

Again assuming cash-value life insurance is to be purchased, a separate issue is whether the insurance should be on a fixed-premium basis or a flexible-premium basis: In *fixed-premium contracts,* the periodic premiums are set in advance by the insurer based on the insured's age, gender, smoker or nonsmoker status, and underwriting status (class). Under *flexible-premium* contracts, the policyowner can decide, within limits, what, if any, premium will be paid in any given year, provided enough is paid to keep the policy from lapsing.

Thus, the consumer is faced with the following choices:

- I. Term insurance
- II. Cash-value or permanent life insurance
  - a. Guaranteed-dollar policies
    - i. Traditional (fixed-premium) cash-value life insurance
    - ii. Flexible-premium policies (universal life [UL] insurance)
  - b. Variable policies
    - i. Variable life insurance (VL)
    - ii. Variable universal life insurance (VUL)

#### **Term Insurance**

Term life insurance provides protection for a specified period. If death occurs during the period, the face amount of the policy is paid, with nothing being paid in the event that the insured survives the period. Term policies generally have no cash or loan values. Since term insurance provides only a death benefit without also building up a cash value, as of a given age at purchase, it will have a lower premium per \$1,000 of insurance than comparable whole life policies.

**Considerations in Buying Term Insurance** While term insurance is rather simple in concept, there are a number of different contracts on the market that the consumer might consider. The prices charged for term insurance vary considerably among life insurance companies, and so some shopping by the consumer (on the Internet, for example), or by an agent or broker representing the consumer, may produce premium savings in this area.

**Annually Renewable Term (ART)** For this term product, which is also called *yearly renewable term* (YRT), the premium charged per \$1,000 of insurance increases for each successive year as the insured's attained age increases. As a result, the cost of a level amount of term insurance will continually increase year by year as the insured grows older. It will be quite low when the insured is younger (say, under age 50), but it will increase dramatically as the insured gets older.

**Level Term** Here, the premium remains fixed, or level, for a stated period of coverage, such as 10, 15, or even 20 or 30 years, after which the premium increases to that of an insured at that attained age. Many level term policies allow renewal for additional similar level term periods, but usually at greatly higher premium rates.

**Reentry Term** This type of policy provides that after a certain number of years of coverage, often 10 years, insureds who pass a new physical examination are permitted to continue their term coverage at a given set of increased term rates (usually the same rates as a new buyer of term insurance at the same age would have to pay), but if the insured does not submit to the new medical examination or fails to pass the new physical, the renewal rates for continued coverage will be substantially higher. Because of this repricing feature, reentry term may carry a lower premium rate per \$1,000 of insurance than other term products, but it also carries greater risks for the policyowner.

**Decreasing Term** This form provides a declining amount of insurance over the period of the contract. A good example is mortgage protection insurance designed to cover for an amount that will pay off an amortizing home mortgage. Sometimes it also may be used to meet the current protection needs for a family when it is perceived that the need for life insurance will decrease over time as children become self-supporting or as a separate investment fund may grow.

**Renewable and Convertible Term** Many term policies are *renewable* for successive periods at the policyowner's option without having to show any evidence of insurability at renewal. The age to which such policies may be renewed usually is limited.

Term policies also generally are *convertible.* This means the policyowner has the right during the conversion period to change the term policy into a whole life or other permanent policy of a like or lesser amount of insurance without having to show any evidence of insurability at the time of conversion. Again, the age up to which a term policy may be converted usually is limited. The renewable and convertible features of term policies can be particularly valuable for insureds who later become uninsurable or insurable only on a substandard basis.

**Term Premium Structures** Term policies may have guaranteed rate structures or may be indeterminate-premium policies.

When there is a *guaranteed rate structure,* the premium rates for each age are set when the policy is issued and cannot be increased in the future. Naturally, as the insured grows older, the premium rate applied will increase; however, the whole rate schedule by age is guaranteed once the policy is issued. *Indeterminate-premium policies,* on the other hand, have a lower current rate structure, which can be increased or decreased by the insurance company according to its actuarial experience, but cannot be increased beyond a higher maximum guaranteed level of rates. Some term policies are participating (i.e., they pay policy dividends), while others are not.

**Term with Whole Life Insurance** Insurance companies often offer life insurance contracts that are combinations of term insurance and whole life insurance. These policies are sometimes called *hybrids* or *blended policies.* They are intended to lower the initial premiums for the policyowner while still providing some cash value in the policy. The term element in blended policies usually will gradually decline over the policy's duration. Furthermore, some policies that nominally are whole life policies are structured so that the cash value develops so slowly that they are essentially term policies. These are sometimes called *term-like* policies.

#### **Cash-Value or Permanent Life Insurance**

This broad classification embraces those policies that are designed to develop a cash value inside the life insurance contract. Traditionally, this cash value developed because of the level-premium approach to paying for this kind of life insurance, in contrast to the increasing premiums with attained age for term insurance. Periodic growth in the cash values of life insurance contracts is often referred to as the *inside buildup* in permanent life insurance policies.

#### **Guaranteed-Dollar Cash-Value Policies**

There are a variety of policies in the guaranteed-dollar category. Because the cash values of these policies are invested by the insurance company and thus constitute part of its overall assets or general portfolio, these policies are sometimes called *portfolio products.* Because the cash values of these policies are included in the general assets of the insurance company, they are subject to the claims of creditors of the insurer in the event of its insolvency.

#### **Traditional (Fixed-Premium) Cash-Value Life Insurance**

These policies have a *fixed premium* that is determined primarily by the insured's age at issue, gender, and whether the insured is a smoker or a nonsmoker.2 Premiums per \$1,000 of life insurance may also be lower for policies with larger face amounts of insurance.

These traditional forms can be *participating* (pay policy dividends based on the actuarial experience of the insurer) or *nonparticipating* (pay no policy dividends). If they are participating, it is the gross premium (before dividends) that is fixed, and the final cost and financial results of the policy often will be substantially affected by the policy dividends (which are *not* guaranteed) that are declared on the policy in the future by the insurance company. These future and uncertain policy dividends on participating life insurance are a major reason why it is so difficult to compare policies.

Gross premiums for these policies are set when the policy is issued, and their guaranteed cash values increase according to a schedule contained in the policy. Thus, the cost elements (mortality cost for death claims, charges for expenses, and the interest rate credited by the insurer on policy values) are not shown to the policyowner separately; hence, these policies may be referred to as *bundled* contracts.3

These policies, in effect, are front-end loaded for expenses. This is because for the first several years a policy is in force, normally there either is no cash value or the cash value is significantly less than the premiums paid. While there is no separately stated expense charge for traditional cash-value policies, the reason for this reduced cash-value pattern is to reflect the expenses of the insurance company in writing the policy. Therefore, the policyowner will lose money if such a policy is surrendered after it has been in force for only a few years.

The following are various kinds of traditional, fixed-premium life insurance contracts. By far, the most common is whole life insurance.

**Whole Life Insurance** This policy furnishes protection for the entire life. Premiums may be paid throughout the insured's lifetime, over a limited period, such as 10, 20, or 30 years, or to a specified age. The premium also may be

3This is in contrast to policies that are *unbundled,* such as universal life, as discussed later in this section.

<sup>2</sup>The premium for any life insurance policy also may be affected by the insured's health and other individual underwriting factors. Thus, so-called substandard policies that do not meet the insurer's underwriting requirements for standard policies normally are "rated" in that they have a higher premium per \$1,000 of insurance than do comparable policies issued at standard rates. In addition, so-called preferred policies also may have lower rates than nonpreferred standard policies.

paid in one lump sum at the inception of the policy, in which case the policy is referred to as a *single-premium whole life* (SPWL) policy. When the insured is to pay premiums throughout his or her lifetime, the policy is commonly referred to as *ordinary life* or *straight life.* When the insured is to pay premiums over a specified period, it is referred to as *limited-payment life insurance.*

**Endowment Insurance** Endowment life insurance offers insurance protection against death for a specified period, such as 10, 20, or 30 years, to age 65, and so forth; then, if the insured lives to the end of the period, the contract pays the face amount. Endowment insurance does not meet the tax law definition of life insurance and so is of no significance in the United States today.

**Modified Life Insurance** Here, the premiums normally are smaller for the first few years than for the remainder of the contract.

**Graded-Premium Whole Life** These contracts are somewhat similar in concept to modified life, except that the initially lower premiums increase annually for a longer period (such as from 5 to 40 years) until they level off. During this annually increasing premium period, there are no or low cash values in these policies.

**Family Income Riders or Policies** Under this type of contract, if the insured dies during a specified family income period, income payments (which might be \$10, \$15, or even \$20 per month for each \$1,000 of face amount) are paid to the beneficiary until the end of the family income period, at which time the face amount of insurance is paid.

**Family Maintenance Riders or Policies** This is similar to the family income policy or rider, except that the income period is for a stated number of years after the insured's death.

**Family Policy** This policy includes coverage on all family members in one contract.

## **Current Assumption or Interest-Sensitive Whole Life**

This is a cross between the traditional whole life policy and UL insurance, which will be discussed next. The policy normally has an initial premium, which can be *redetermined* (recalculated by the insurance company) periodically, based on new actuarial assumptions and the level of the policy's current accumulation account. The policy does provide some guarantees as to minimum interest rates and perhaps maximum mortality and expense charges in setting any new actuarial assumptions.

The policy's current *accumulation account* (cash value) is determined by using the current experience of the insurance company. From the periodic premium as currently set by the insurer, an expense charge may be deducted and the net amount added to the previous year's accumulation account. Then, interest is credited at the current rate being assumed, and a mortality charge calculated on the pure life insurance protection (the policy face minus the accumulation account) is deducted. The balance is the policy's accumulation account at the end of the year.

#### **Universal Life (UL)**

**General Features** The key aspects of UL insurance are flexibility for the policyowner and identifiable cost elements. The policy cash value is set up as a cash-value fund (or accumulation fund) to which is credited any net premium payments by the policyowner and a current interest rate, and from which is taken the cost of term insurance (as a mortality charge) at the insured's attained age and any annual expense charges. This separation of the cash value from the death benefit has been referred to as *unbundling* the traditional life insurance product, or as an *open architectural* product.

**Premium Payments** For UL, these are at the discretion of the policyowner, except that there must be a minimum initial premium to start coverage, and then there must be at least enough cash value in the policy each month to cover the mortality and any expense charges so the policy will not lapse. Insurers also set maximum premium payments.

**Death Benefits** There are two general types of death benefit systems under UL: option A and option B. Under option A, there is a level death benefit, and so if the cash value increases, the net amount of pure (or term) death protection (also referred to as the *net amount at risk*) declines. Under option B, the death benefit is equal to a specified face amount selected by the policyowner when the policy is purchased, plus the policy's current cash value. Thus, under this option, the death benefit will increase if the cash value increases. Which of these options the policyowner should purchase depends on how much insurance protection is desired relative to the investment element in the policy. Option B provides more death protection relative to cash value than option A. Finally, insurers often allow policyowners to increase or decrease their policies' death benefits as they desire, except that if the death benefit is increased, the insured generally must show individual evidence of insurability.

**Interest Credits** The cash value under UL is credited with an interest rate (usually monthly). There is a guaranteed minimum interest rate specified in the policy, and then the insurer may pay a higher current crediting rate. The interest rates actually paid by an insurer on its UL policies may be determined in several ways. One is a *portfolio rate,* which is one rate set by the insurer and generally based on the investment performance of the insurer's whole investment portfolio. This is the most common approach. A second option is a *new money approach,* where the insurer sets more than one rate depending on when the policy premiums were paid. Third, some UL policies credit interest rates that are indexed to some outside interest rate measure, such as a percentage of average long-term corporate bond rates. This is known as *interest-indexed life* (IIL) *insurance.* Finally, a few policies base the current return on some outside equity index, such as the S&P 500 stock index. This is called *equity-indexed universal life* (EIUL).

UL policies often are sold based on certain assumptions (projections) of the interest rates that will be paid on cash values far into the future. The same kind of thing also is done for other kinds of life insurance policies. The consumer should be careful of these long-term projections because no one can know what interest rates (or the other cost elements of life insurance) will be 10, 20, 30, or more years from now. Instead, the consumer should note the current interest rate on any policy being considered, what the history of the insurer has been with regard to interest rates paid, and the minimum guaranteed rate in the policy. Naturally, the financial strength and general reputation of the insurer are of paramount importance.

**Mortality Charges** A *cost of insurance (COI)* charge is the mortality cost that is deducted each month from the cash value based on the insured's attained age and the policy's current net amount at risk. The net amount at risk is the policy's death benefit minus its cash value. UL policies typically have a schedule of guaranteed maximum mortality charges, but the insurer often charges less than the guaranteed maximum as the current COI. However, the insurer can increase (up to the maximum) or decrease the current mortality charges.

**Expense Charges** Insurers also may levy expense charges against premiums or cash values. Some UL policies have *front-end loads,* whereby an expense charge is made for the first policy year and perhaps lower charges in subsequent years. Others do not charge any front-end load. UL policies also may have *back-end loads,* which are charges levied on the surrender or exchange of the policy. Such back-end loads normally diminish year by year as the policy remains in force, reaching zero at a certain point (say, after 10 to 15 years). Some policies have both front-end and back-end loads.

In any event, insurers can recover their sales and administrative costs from the spread between what the insurer earns on his or her own investment portfolio and the interest rate credited to the policy. This is one of the things that makes comparing UL policies with traditional whole life policies difficult. Traditional whole life policies charge initial costs to the first few premiums (in effect, they have a front-end load) and hence have no or reduced early cash values. However, once there is a cash value, they may credit it with higher interest rates. UL policies, on the other hand, may have no front-end load and hence no or little reduction in cash values, but they may credit lower interest rates.

**Cash Withdrawals** Since UL policies are unbundled, they normally allow the policyowner to make cash withdrawals (partial surrenders) from the cash value while the policy is in force. This can be an attractive feature. However, any such withdrawals often reduce the policy's death benefit dollar for dollar. UL policies also have policy loan provisions like other permanent life insurance policies. On the other hand, traditional whole life policies do not permit such partial withdrawals.

**Target Premiums** UL policies usually have target premium amounts, which are suggested annual level premiums that will keep the policy in force, given certain actuarial and interest assumptions. These are not guaranteed or required premiums, but only projections based on assumed levels of credited interest.

However, insurers do offer riders to UL policies that provide guarantees that the policy will not lapse if specified premiums are paid. These are referred to as no-lapse guarantee universal life policies (NLGUL policies) and are discussed later in this chapter.

The UL policies of different insurance companies can vary considerably as to the current interest rate being credited, the guaranteed interest rate, the method used to credit interest, mortality charges, and the nature and amount of any expense charges. Consumers need to consider all of these factors.

#### **Variable Policies**

**General Features** As opposed to the guaranteed- or fixed-principal approach just discussed, variable policies allow the policyowner to allocate his or her premium payments to or among one or more investment subaccounts (mutual funds) offered by the insurance company and also to shift cash values among the subaccounts. The amount of the policy cash value, and perhaps the death benefit, depend on the values (investment performance) of the subaccount or accounts to which the policyowner has allocated the funds under the policy. Hence, the investment decisions and the corresponding investment risks fall on the policyowner rather than on the insurer.

**Investment Accounts** The subaccounts offered under variable life policies (and under variable annuities, as described in Chapter 17) essentially are mutual funds held by the insurance company in a separate account that is distinct from the insurer's general investment portfolio. Insurers may offer a significant number of subaccounts with a wide range of investment

#### **Life Insurance and Social Security 495**

objectives in their variable products. Policyowners also may be given the option of having their funds invested in the general investment portfolio of the insurance company (a fixed-principal account). These subaccounts are much like a group (or *family*) of mutual funds; in fact, in many cases the same investment management firms that manage groups of mutual funds also provide subaccounts to insurers for their separate accounts.4

One important reason for the development of variable life insurance was to allow policyowners to invest their policy cash values in whole or in part in common stock funds or balanced funds that would be more competitive with other kinds of investment media (such as mutual funds) and that would maintainâ€”or even enhanceâ€”the purchasing power of policy values in the face of inflation. However, the investment performance of subaccounts can vary considerably among life insurance companies. Also, like other investment companies, an analysis of insurance company subaccount performance should be over a considerable timeâ€”such as 5, 10, 15, or even 20 years, if availableâ€”rather than for only one or a few good years. Policyowners may follow other investment strategies in these accounts as well, such as in bond or other subaccounts.

**Changes in Asset Allocation** A significant investment/tax advantage of variable insurance products (either variable life insurance or variable annuities) lies in the ability of the policyowner to move the policy cash value among the subaccounts inside the policy without any current income tax liability. In effect, this allows the policyowner to make changes in his or her asset allocation strategy within the policy without adverse tax consequences.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume Norman Lee purchased a VUL insurance policy (described next) a number of years ago and has paid a total of \$150,000 in premiums for the policy, which has a \$1,000,000 (type A) face amount. He has elected to have the policy's cash value placed in a common stock subaccount, which is now worth \$400,000. However, Norman has become concerned that he has too much of his overall investment portfolio in common stocks. Therefore, he has decided to change the VUL policy's cash value from the policy's common stock account to its investment-grade bond account. This change is not deemed a sale or exchange of a capital asset for capital gains tax purposes. Furthermore, if Norman should become dissatisfied with the investment management of the

4However, for tax reasons, the subaccounts under variable life insurance and variable annuities cannot be the same as the mutual funds offered by these firms to the public.

subaccounts in his VUL policy, he could exchange his policy, income taxâ€“free under the provisions of IRC Section 1035, for another life insurance policy with a different insurer. Of course, any surrender charge (back-end load) applicable to his VUL policy would apply to such a tax-free exchange. Thus, the policyowner can have considerable flexibility when changing the asset allocation under a variable life (or variable annuity) policy.5

Variable policies are of two general types: *variable life (VL) insurance* and *variable universal life (VUL) insurance*.

**VL Insurance** This is a fixed-premium contract that is similar in some ways to traditional fixed-premium (nonvariable) whole life insurance. In VL, however, the cash values and death benefits vary with the investment experience of the subaccounts to which premiums are allocated. However, VL policies have a guaranteed minimum death benefit. They were the original contracts sold as variable insurance and are not common today.

**VUL Insurance** This is the more common form of variable life insurance. It is universal life combined with the variable life concept. The policyowner can decide into which subaccount or accounts his or her flexible premiums will go. The cash value then will be determined by the investment experience of the subaccount or accounts chosen. The death benefit will depend on whether the policyowner selects UL option A (level death benefit) or option B (face amount plus the cash value at death). Thus, under VUL, the policyowner has the greatest flexibility of allâ€”flexibility with regard to both investment of cash values and payment of premiums.

**Expense Charges in VUL** There are expense loadings in VUL products, which can be significant. First, VUL policies often have initial sales charges

<sup>5</sup>By way of comparison, if instead these investment funds had not been in subaccounts under a variable life policy (or variable annuity), but rather had been mutual funds in a family of mutual funds (as explained in Chapter 8), then the exchanging of one mutual fund (say, a common stock fund) for another mutual fund (say, an investment-grade bond fund), as in this illustration, would result in an exchange of a capital asset for another for capital gains tax purposes and hence, a currently taxable gain or a loss. In this illustration, there would have been a currently recognized \$250,000 capital gain (\$400,000 value [amount realized] â€“ \$150,000 adjusted basis = \$250,000 capital gain). There would, of course, have been the same gain if Norman had held the stocks and then the bonds directly rather than through a family of mutual funds. On the other hand, if there had been a capital loss on this transaction, it would have been better tax-wise to have held the assets in a mutual fund or directly, because then Norman could have taken the loss currently against any capital gains he might have had that year and then against ordinary income to the extent of \$3,000 per year. See Chapters 10 and 11 for a more complete discussion of these tax concepts.

(front-end loads) based on the premiums paid. Furthermore, they may have back-end loads upon surrenderâ€”referred to as *surrender charges* or *contingent deferred sales charges.* Like UL policies, these back-end loads decline with policy duration and after 10 to 15 years, usually reach zero.

Second, there are annual (or periodic) *investment management fees* levied against the net assets of the particular subaccounts. The amount of these fees varies, depending on the nature of the subaccount. For example, an investment management fee might be 1.2 percent for a growth common stock account, 0.8 percent for a bond account, and 0.5 percent for a money market account. These fees are to cover the expenses of investing the subaccounts and are referred to as *fund-* or *account-level fees.*

Third, there are annual (or periodic) *mortality and expense* (M&E) *risk charges* levied against the assets of each policy. M&E charges are to cover administrative expenses and provide a margin for the insurer. M&E risk charges vary among insurers, but might range from 0.6 percent to 1.0 percent or more. They sometimes are referred to as *policy-* or *contract-level fees.*

Fourth, there may be periodic *administrative charges.* These may be a fixed amount per policy or a percentage of premiums or values. There may be a further charge for premium taxes.

The total of these annual expense loadings vary considerably among insurers, but may range, say, from 1 percent or less to 2.5 percent or more per year of the assets standing behind a VUL policy.6 Since these expense loadings can be significant, the consumer should evaluate them in relation to those of other VUL policies.

**Mortality Costs in VUL** In addition to the expense loadings just described, VUL policies also charge a *cost of insurance* (COI) for the mortality cost or term cost of the pure life insurance protection they are providing. This is a periodic mortality charge that varies with the insured's attained age and is applied to the net amount at risk under the policy, as was described earlier for UL policies.

#### **No-Lapse Guarantees for UL and VUL Policies**

It can be seen from the preceding discussion that a traditional whole life policy with its fixed premium *will not* lapse (terminate) as long as the

<sup>6</sup>This percentage of assets is somewhat analogous to the expense ratio of mutual funds, which is discussed in Chapter 8. The comparison is not completely appropriate, however, because mutual funds themselves do not provide life insurance protection, and some of the periodic expense loadings of variable policies are for the creation or administration of the life insurance coverage (although not for the actual term cost). Recognizing that there are limitations on the comparison, the expense ratios of comparable mutual funds are generally lower than the expense loadings as a percentage of plan assets for variable life insurance.

policyowner continues to pay the premium or the policy otherwise becomes paid up. The guaranteed cash value in the policy also will continue to increase. Furthermore, if the policy is participating, the insurer may continue to pay policy dividends.

However, in the case of UL and VUL policies, with their flexible premiums, policies *may lapse* before the insured's death. This will depend on the premium payments actually made by the policyowner, the investment performance of the cash value (i.e., the interest credited for UL and the subaccount performance for VUL), the monthly charges against the cash value (e.g., COI for UL and COI, M&E risk, and account level charges for VUL), and any partial withdrawals from the cash value.

Therefore, insurance companies now may offer no-lapse riders for UL and VUL policies to protect policyowners against lapse as long as they meet certain conditions. These are also called *secondary guarantees*.

Many insurers offer no-lapse guarantee riders for UL policies (referred to as NLGUL policies). These riders guarantee against lapse as long as the policyowner pays a stated annual premium. The *guarantee period* varies, but may be until the insured reaches age 100, 121, or for the insured's lifetime. The stated premium also varies among insurers and will have to be paid until the insured reaches a specified age (such as age 100 or 121) or dies. Insurers charge additional premiums for no-lapse guarantee riders.

The original no-lapse guarantee feature had a strict requirement that the stated premium had to be paid on time. If the policyowner failed to do so, the no-lapse guarantee would be void. However, later UL no-lapse guarantee structures contained what is called a "shadow account design." The shadow account is a hypothetical account (not the real cash value), and as long as this shadow account showed a value, the secondary guarantee would not be voided even if the policyowner failed to pay a stated premium when due.

The stated premiums for NLGUL policies typically are considerably less than the guaranteed fixed gross premiums for comparable traditional whole life insurance. However, the cash values of NLGUL policies are not guaranteed, while they are for traditional whole life policies.

Some insurers also sell no-lapse riders for VUL policies, often regardless of the subaccounts in which policy values are invested. These are referred to as NLGVUL policies. Like NLGUL policies, these contracts have stated annual premiums, guarantee periods, and periods of time the stated premiums must be paid.

Under NLGUL and NLGVUL policies, the cash values can increase or decline, depending on the policy's investment returns, stated premiums paid, and the annual COI and expense charges taken from the cash value. In fact, it is possible that the cash value could fall to the point where it would not cover the annual charges levied by the insurer against the policy, and even fall to zero. Even if that occurred, however, the policy would not lapse because of the secondary guarantee. In that event, the insurer would have to carry the policy (pay its costs) out of its own assets.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Harry Shapiro, age 55, is a real estate investor with a potentially sizeable estate that will attract federal estate taxation. Since his real estate holdings are not liquid or readily marketable, Harry is interested in buying an additional \$2,000,000 of life insurance for estate liquidity and conservation purposes (as described in Chapter 29). Harry is in good health and his insurance adviser has told him that he can secure a \$2,000,000 NLGUL policy, nonsmoker, best underwriting class, with a lifetime guarantee period, and premiums payable until age 100, from an excellently rated insurer for an annual stated premium of \$25,000. Harry decides to buy this policy because he is primarily concerned with death protection for the whole of his life at a level premium in a sound insurer. Cash-value accumulation is of secondary importance to him.

#### **Second-to-Die or Survivorship Life Insurance**

All the previously discussed forms of life insurance cover only one person's life as the insured. Second-to-die life insurance (also called *survivorship* or *joint and last survivor* life insurance) normally insures two lives in the same policy and the policy proceeds are payable at the death of the second insured to die. The two lives insured are usually a husband and wife.

Premiums on second-to-die policies normally are considerably less than the premiums for comparable policies on single lives of the same ages, sex, and amount. This is because two lives are insured and the proceeds are not payable until the second death.

One thing to consider when purchasing second-to-die life insurance is whether the policy allows the owners to split it into two single-life plans, one for each life insured, in amounts on each equal to the second-to-die policy benefit or some other amount, or to change it into a single-life plan on only one of the insureds. Most policies allow such a split. This right may be valuable for spouses in the event of divorce or other family discord, possible changes in the estate tax law, or changes in their estate situation or plans.

#### **First-to-Die or Joint Life Insurance**

Under this form, two or more lives are insured in the same policy and the policy proceeds are payable to the beneficiary at the death of the first insured to die. The lives insured may be a husband and wife, or they may be others, such as the owners of a closely held business pursuant to a buyâ€“sell agreement. For example, both spouses may be working outside the home and both their incomes may be needed to support their family. Hence, insurance is needed at either of their deaths, and a joint life policy might be purchased. Furthermore, suppose there are three stockholders of a closely held corporation who have agreed to buy each other out in the event one of them dies (a buyâ€“sell agreement). The agreement could be funded with a joint life policy insuring all three of them. Joint life policies often allow the policy to be split into two or more single-life plans. Since a joint life policy usually terminates after the first death, the policies may contain an option for a surviving insured to continue insurance under a separate single life policy or, if there is more than one survivor, under a new joint life policy.

#### **Private Placement Life Insurance**

The courts have held that variable insurance products (variable life and variable annuities) are securities and so must meet the requirements of the securities laws when sold to the public. As noted in Chapter 2, this involves registration with the SEC and meeting the requirements of federal and state securities laws, as well as state insurance laws. However, an exception to these registration requirements is when securities are sold as a private placement.

Private placement life insurance is variable universal life insurance (PPVUL) that typically is customized and sold to a limited group of highnet-worth purchasers (such as accredited investors and qualified purchasers for domestic sales). It is not registered with the SEC or state securities regulators. It may be sold as a domestic private placement or an offshore private placement. There may be considerable flexibility in the subaccounts allowed in such policies, such as alternative investments like hedge funds, private equity, commodity funds and the like. There may be pricing flexibility as well.

#### **Internal Rates of Return (IRRs) for Life Insurance Values**

It is clear from the previous discussion that there are a wide variety of life insurance contracts available to the public with different cash flow patterns (i.e., premiums, dividends, cash values, and death proceeds). It is difficult to compare the returns for these policies. Also, it has been suggested here and in Chapter 9 that life insurance should be considered as an asset class for asset allocation purposes. In this case, it is valuable to have an idea of how efficient life insurance is as a way to transfer wealth to the insured's family and heirs. An analysis of an insurance policy's projected values and their resulting internal rates of return, assuming surrender for cash and death at an advanced age (i.e., after a long period in force), will be helpful in considering these issues.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

John Roma is age 40, in good health, a nonsmoker, and a successful business owner. He is interested in including life insurance in his asset allocation planning as a way to transfer wealth to trusts in his family after his death, and to provide a guaranteed cash value, if he needs it, for retirement puposes or possibly business needs (through policy loans). It has been suggested that John purchase a \$1,000,000 participating whole life policy from a top-rated insurer and use policy dividends to purchase paid-up additional amounts of insurance.

However, John would like some idea of how efficient this policy may be for these purposes. His insurance adviser has furnished John with a projection of potential future policy values (called a ledger statement) based on its current premium and guaranteed cash values (which are guaranteed) and its current dividend scale (which is not guaranteed). This projection estimates that if John surrenders the policy for cash at age 65, its internal rate of return (IRR) on the surrender value will have been almost 4.0 percent, and if he surrenders it at age 80, the IRR is estimated at about 5.6 percent (ignoring income tax on the untaxed buildup). On the other hand, if John continues the policy until he dies, say at age 80, the IRR in the death proceeds is estimated to be about 7.5 percent (with death benefits being income taxâ€“free).

It can be suggested to John, then, that an IRR on surrender of say, 4.0 percent or 5.6 percent on a stable value asset is quite reasonable considering that John's family will have had the life insurance protection for 25 or 40 years. However, depending on whether its policyowner needs the cash value for retirement or other purposes, it generally is better not to surrender life insurance policies for cash, but rather to retain them until the insured's death. Other policies will have different results. For example, NLGUL policies normally will show better results at death than on surrender. Also, it must be remembered that these results are based on projections over long periods of time.

#### **A Diversification Strategy in Purchasing Life Insurance**

With the sometimes bewildering growth in different kinds of life insurance policies and the current emphasis on insurer financial soundness, insurance advisers may recommend that persons buying life insurance, particularly if the amounts are substantial, diversify their purchases by kind of policy and also among different financially sound insurance companies. This is simply transferring to insurance purchases the diversification concepts we routinely employ in the investment area.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

As an illustration, assume that Jane Olson is the divorced mother of two young children. Jane earns a good salary and her future career prospects are bright, but she works for a smaller company that provides her with only \$50,000 of noncontributory group term life insurance. To protect her children and provide for their education if she should die prematurely, Jane feels she needs at least \$1,500,000 of life insurance. To satisfy the need for an additional \$1,450,000 of life insurance, Jane might purchase \$650,000 of preferred term (she is in excellent health) from one insurance company to get immediate, low-cost protection. This term should be renewable and convertible. She also might purchase \$400,000 of participating traditional whole life insurance from another company to get guaranteed premiums and to start building a guaranteed cash value. Policy dividends (if the policy is participating) can be used to purchase paid-up additions to increase gradually her life insurance protection and cash values. Finally, Jane might purchase \$400,000 of VUL insurance in a third company. She could allocate the cash value of this policy to one or more of its subaccounts (including common stock accounts), if desired, but in making this decision, she should consider her overall asset allocation strategy.

This example is only meant to illustrate the diversification concept. There is no correct diversification model for everyone. Different combinations of policies could be recommended, depending on a person's or couple's needs, current premium-paying ability, tolerance for risk, relative desire for flexibility and guarantees, investment philosophy, and other factors.

There are some downsides to diversification. The first is complexity. Furthermore, sometimes life insurance is less expensive when purchased in larger policies. Finally, sometimes consumers have a single insurance-buying philosophy that they wish to follow. However, as in asset allocation in general, for people buying significant amounts of life insurance, diversification often seems the better strategy.

## **Definitions of Life Insurance for Income Tax Purposes**

#### **Tax Advantages of Life Insurance: An Overview**

Life insurance contracts have a number of income tax advantages for the policyowner and beneficiary. First, life insurance proceeds paid by reason of the insured's death normally are received income taxâ€“free by the beneficiary. Second, the periodic increase, or changes in subaccounts in variable products, of policy cash values are not taxed currently as income. Third, loans secured by life insurance policies are treated for tax purposes as loans and not as taxable distributions. Fourth, there is no 10 percent penalty tax on premature distributions (generally, distributions before age 59Â½) from life insurance policies. Fifth, partial surrenders (withdrawals), where permitted by the policy, are viewed as coming first tax free from the policyowner's investment in the contract (income tax basis) and then, when that tax basis is recovered, from potentially taxable investment earnings inside the policy.7 Finally, one life insurance policy can be exchanged tax-free for another life insurance policy or for an annuity contract under Section 1035 of the IRC.

#### **General Tax Definition of Life Insurance (IRC Section 7702)**

In order to get these rather substantial tax advantages, a policy issued after December 31, 1984, must be a life insurance contract under state law and must meet one of two alternative tests under Section 7702 of the IRC. These tests are a cash-value accumulation test or a guideline premium and corridor test.

## **Modified Endowment Contracts (MECs)**

An MEC is a policy that meets the general tax law definition of life insurance, was entered into on or after June 21, 1988, and does not meet a special seven-pay test given in the law. A policy will not meet this seven-pay test if the accumulated premiums at any time during the first seven years of the policy are more than what would have been the sum of the net level premiums for a paid-up policy at the end of seven years. In essence, this rather

<sup>7</sup>The income tax status of life insurance policies is discussed further in Chapter 29. Also, as noted next, some of these tax advantages do not apply to modified endowment contracts.

complicated definition means that if premiums are paid faster than those for a hypothetical seven-pay life policy, it is an MEC.

The significance of being an MEC is that such a policy loses some, but not all, of the income tax benefits from being a life insurance contract. Loans secured by an MEC are treated as taxable distributions, there is a 10 percent penalty tax on premature distributions, and distributions from MECs are viewed as first coming from the investment earnings inside the policy (and hence are taxable) and then as a tax-free return of the policyowner's investment in the contract.8

A policy that otherwise would be an MEC entered into before June 21, 1988, generally is "grandfathered" and the regular tax rules applying to life insurance apply to it, unless the policy is materially changed. Of course, life insurance contracts whose premium-payment patterns meet the seven-pay test are not MECs, regardless of when they were entered into. Most life insurance policies are not MECs.

#### **Single-Premium Life Insurance**

This represents primarily an investment-type life insurance product. The policyowner pays a single premium and receives a fully paid-up life insurance contract. Single-premium policies are written as whole life (SPWL), variable life, universal life, and variable universal life policies. As just explained, they now are taxed as MECs (unless grandfathered).

#### **The Life Insurance Contract**

Several features of individual policies may be useful in planning. They are explained next.

#### **Some Important Policy Provisions**

**Assignment** Life insurance contracts are freely transferable (assignable) by the owner. There are two types of assignments. One is the *absolute assignment,* under which all ownership rights are transferred to another. An absolute assignment may be used, for example, when a policy is given to another person or to an irrevocable trust to avoid federal estate taxation (see Chapter 29).

<sup>8</sup>These income tax rules also apply to regular (nonqualified) annuity contracts, as explained in Chapter 17. Thus, in effect, the tax writers applied some of the nonqualified annuity income tax rules to life insurance contracts *when they are MECs.*

The second type is the *collateral assignment,* whereby only certain rights are transferred to another when the policy is to serve as security for a loan.

**Grace Period** The grace period, commonly 31 days, is a period, after the premium for a life insurance policy is due, during which the policy remains in full force even though the premium has not yet been paid.

**Incontestability** This provision states that after a life insurance contract has been in force a certain length of time (called the *contestable period*), which normally is two years, the insurer agrees not to deny a claim because of any error, concealment, or misstatement by the applicant.

**Suicide** Life insurance contracts contain a suicide provision stating that if the insured commits suicide during a certain period after the policy is issued, generally two years, the insurer is liable only to return the premiums paid. After the two-year period, suicide is a covered cause of death.

**Reinstatement** This clause usually gives the insured the right to reinstate the policy within a specified period, usually three years of any default in premium payment, subject to furnishing evidence of insurability and payment of back premiums.

**Policy Loan Provision** This provision allows the policyowner to take a loan (technically an *advance,* because it does not have to be repaid) up to an amount that, with interest on the loan, will not exceed the cash (loan) value of the policy. The rate of interest may be stated in the contract or may vary periodically according to some standard. Policy loans on older policies may have a 5 or 6 percent guaranteed interest rate, and on more recent policies an 8 percent guaranteed rate. Some policies allow for lower loan rates after the policy has been in force for a certain time and on loans below a certain percentage of the cash value. Loan rates may also be expressed on a net interest basis (such as 1 or 2 percent over the rate of return in the policy).

The policy loan provision enables the policyowner to draw on policy cash values to meet financial needs without surrendering the contract. It also enables the policyowner to take money out of his or her life insurance policy (except for an MEC) without any income tax liability.

On the other hand, an important disadvantage of policy loans is that death proceeds will be reduced by any outstanding policy loans at that insured's death. Furthermore, interest paid by individuals on policy loans generally is not deductible for federal income tax purposes.

Finally, many insurance companies include in their policies a *direct recognition provision* under which policy dividends or credited interest rates are less for policies with policy loans against them than for comparable policies without such loans.

**Automatic Premium Loan Provision** This provision operates when a policyowner fails to pay a premium when due. In this event, the premium is paid as a policy loan and the policy does not lapse, as long as there is enough loan value in the contract.

**Beneficiary Designation** A life insurance contract allows the policyowner to select the person or persons who will receive the proceeds of the contract in the event of the insured's death. When the owner reserves the right to change the beneficiary, the beneficiary designation is called *revocable.* When the owner does not reserve this right, the designation is called *irrevocable.* An irrevocable beneficiary in effect becomes a joint owner of the policy rights. Revocable beneficiary designations are used in most cases. It also usually is advisable to name a second or contingent beneficiary to receive the proceeds in case the first (primary) beneficiary predeceases the insured.

**Policyownership** Life insurance policies generally state on the front of the contract who owns the policy. This is the person, persons, or entity who legally owns the right to exercise all rights and powers under the contract, which are technically called *incidents of ownership.* The policyowner may be the same person as the one whose life is insured, or it may be someone else or another entity (such as the trustee of a trust, a corporation, a partnership, or other business entity). Ownership of a life insurance contract may be transferred to another by gift or by sale during the insured's lifetime.

## **Cash Values and Nonforfeiture Options**

Life insurance contracts are required to include certain nonforfeiture provisions (options). These options normally include a cash surrender value, reduced paid-up life insurance, or extended term life insurance.

**Cash Surrender Value** Under state nonforfeiture laws, a cash value generally is required, at the latest, after premiums have been paid for three years and the policy produces a nonforfeiture value. Many traditional whole life policies today, however, provide for some cash value at the end of the second (or even first) year. For UL, VUL, and interest-sensitive whole life, there may be a cash value the first year.

When the cash-value option is elected by a policyowner, the policy is surrendered to the insurance company for cash, the life insurance protection ceases, and the insurer has no further obligation under the policy. Furthermore, surrender of a life insurance contract will produce ordinary income for the policyowner to the extent the cash surrender value received exceeds the net premiums paid for the contract. Hence, in general, surrendering life insurance policies for cash may be a questionable financial and tax strategy. Some strategies for taking cash out of life insurance contracts without surrendering them are discussed in Chapter 29.

**Reduced Paid-Up Insurance** This option permits the policyowner to use the cash value to produce paid-up insurance of the same type as the original policy but for a reduced face amount. This option might be appropriate when a smaller amount of permanent insurance is satisfactory and it is desirable to discontinue premium payments. Furthermore, if the policy is participating, policy dividends will continue to be paid.

**Extended Term Insurance** This nonforfeiture option allows the policyowner to exchange the cash value for paid-up term insurance for the full face amount of the policy for a limited period.

### **Uses of Policy Dividends**

Policyowners who have participating life insurance contracts may use the policy dividends in various ways, called dividend options.

**Types of Dividend Options** These options usually allow dividends to be taken in cash, applied toward payment of future premiums, left with the insurance company to accumulate interest, used to buy additional amounts of paid-up insurance (called *paid-up additions*), or used to purchase one-year term insurance.

Cash dividends frequently are taken when a policy is paid up. This may be done, for example, during retirement to provide an additional source of retirement income. The use of dividends toward the payment of future premiums may be a convenient and simple way to handle dividends.

A popular dividend option is *paid-up additions.* These have cash values of their own and are themselves participating. Furthermore, the growth in the cash values of paid-up additions is not subject to current income taxation. One-year term insurance, generally equal to the cash value of the policy, is offered by many insurance companies.

**Vanishing-Premium Insurance (Quick-Pay Plans)** This idea for participating life insurance policies is to use policy dividends, and possibly cash values of surrendered paid-up additions, to pay the current policy premiums. The concept is that when a policy has been in force long enough, the premium can be paid by the current year's policy dividend and, in case that dividend is not sufficient to pay the whole premium, by the cash value from the surrender of just enough previously purchased paid-up additions to make up the difference. The policy duration at which this can be done depends on the insurance company's dividend scale and is not guaranteed.

It must be emphasized, however, that quick-pay is not the same as paidup life insurance. When a life insurance policy is paid up, it means that the accumulated values in the policy are equal to the net single premium for the face amount of insurance, and so it is guaranteed that no further premiums are required to keep the policy in force. Both participating and nonparticipating policies can become paid up.

## **Settlement Options**

Life insurance policies provide that when the proceeds become payable, the insured or the beneficiary may elect to have such proceeds paid in some form other than a lump sum. These forms are called *settlement options.* They include interest options, fixed-amount options, fixed-period options, and life income options. One of the planning decisions a policyowner must make is whether to have his or her life insurance payable on the insured's death in a lump sum, under one or more policy settlement options, or to a trust. This issue is discussed further in Chapter 29.

**Interest Option** The proceeds of a life insurance policy may be left with the insurer at a guaranteed rate of interest, such as 3 or 4 percent. In addition, most life insurers pay an additional, nonguaranteed rate of interest consistent with the earnings on their investments (called *excess interest*). Proceeds left under the interest option may carry a limited or unlimited right of withdrawal by the beneficiary. The beneficiary also may be given the right to change to another option or options.

**Fixed-Amount Option** This option provides a stated amount of income each month until the proceeds are exhausted. Each payment is partly interest and partly a return of principal. Again, the insurer usually guarantees a minimum rate of interest, but actually pays a rate closer to that being earned on its investments.

**Fixed-Period Option** This option is similar to the fixed-amount option, except that the time over which payments are made is fixed and the amount of each monthly installment varies accordingly.

**Life Income Options** Under this option, the insured or beneficiary elects to have the proceeds paid for the rest of his or her life, or for the life of one or more beneficiaries. This amounts to using the proceeds to buy a life annuity or a life annuity with a survivorship feature.

#### **Supplementary Benefits Added to Individual Life Insurance Contracts**

Supplementary benefits or riders are a way of adding additional amounts and/or types of benefits to a basic life insurance contract.

**Guaranteed Insurability** For an additional premium, this option permits the policyowner to purchase additional amounts of insurance at stated intervals without further proof of insurability.

**Double Indemnity** This clause or rider, often referred to as an *accidental death benefit,* provides that double (or sometimes triple or more) the face amount of life insurance is payable if the insured's death is caused by accidental means. From an economic standpoint, there seems little justification for double indemnity.

**Waiver of Premium** This benefit may be added for an extra premium or it may be included in the basic rates. It provides that, in the event the insured becomes totally disabled before a certain age, typically 60 or 65, premiums on the life insurance policy will be waived during the continuance of disability. The values in the policy continue just as if the disabled insured actually were paying the premiums.

**Disability Income Riders** Some life insurance companies allow disability income benefits to be added to permanent life insurance policies for an extra premium.

**Long-Term Care (LTC) Riders** For an additional premium, life insurers may offer riders to individual life insurance contracts that provide long-term care (LTC) benefits for skilled or intermediate nursing home care, custodial care, and home health care. LTC coverage is described in greater detail in Chapter 23. As noted previously in Chapter 17, PPA of 2006 provides that in 2010 and thereafter for combination contracts (i.e., those combining life insurance or annuities and LTC coverage), charges for LTC insurance taken from the life insurance or annuity cash values will not be gross income for tax purposes. However, the policy basis will be reduced by such charges.

**Accelerated Death Benefit Provisions** Many life insurance contracts provide that the discounted value of all or a portion of the policy death benefit will be paid to the policyowner in the event the insured contracts a dread disease, at the onset of a terminal illness, or perhaps in specified other events (such as permanent residence in a nursing home). Such accelerated benefits reduce the cash value and death benefits of the underlying policy. There may be no initial premium charged for this benefit.

**Other Riders** There can be a variety of other riders or options on life insurance contracts. These might include options to provide additional amounts of life insurance and cash values through increased premiums, options to make one-time payments (dump-ins) into life policies, children's insurance riders, payor's benefit riders, term insurance riders, options to change premium patterns, and transfer-of-insureds riders.

## **Planning and Using Life Insurance Life Insurance Premiums and Dividends**

**Premiums Graded (Reduced) by Size of Policy** Most life insurers follow the practice of grading premium rates by size of policy issued. That is, the larger the face amount of the policy, the lower the premium rate will be per \$1,000 of insurance. As a practical matter, another way of doing this is by offering certain policies only in minimum face amounts.

**Lower Cost for Women** Women have lower mortality rates than men. Today, life insurance companies have lower premium rates for women than for men, and sometimes the difference can be substantial.

**Life Insurance Policy Dividends** *Participating* whole life insurance refunds a portion of the gross premium to the policyowner in the form of policy dividends that are based on the insurer's actual mortality experience, investment earnings, and administrative expenses. Such policy dividends cannot be guaranteed by the insurer and depend on the insurer's actual experience. Policy dividends do not constitute gross income for income tax purposes to the policyowner, but they may reduce a policy's income tax basis.

For most participating whole life insurance plans, a given dividend scale will produce dividends that generally increase with policy duration. However, an insurer may increase or decrease its whole dividend scale depending on its experience.

#### **Beneficiary Designations**

The right to name a beneficiary is vested in the policyowner. Most policyowners also reserve the right to change the beneficiary. Consider this beneficiary designation: "Sue Smith, wife of the insured, if living at the death of the insured, otherwise equally to such of the lawful children of the insured as may be living at the death of the insured." Here, Sue Smith is the primary beneficiary and the children are contingent beneficiaries. Second contingent beneficiaries may be designated in the event that none of the primary or contingent beneficiaries survive the insured. On the other hand, if a policy is owned by someone other than the insured (a trust, for example), the policyowner also should be named as beneficiary.

An insured who is also the owner of the policy may wish to have the death proceeds paid to a trustee as beneficiary, with the trust to be administered for his or her family, rather than to individual beneficiaries. Such a trust may be established under an agreement signed by the insured during his or her lifetime or under the insured's will. Sometimes, insureds name an individual (e.g., wife or husband) as primary beneficiary and a trustee as contingent beneficiary. This is referred to as a *contingent life insurance trust.*

#### **How Should Life Insurance Be Arranged in the Financial Plan?**

The issues of how life insurance should be owned, who or what entity should be the beneficiary, how it should be arranged for tax purposes, how life insurance can provide liquidity for an estate or business, and similar matters, are important and can be complex. They are considered in greater depth in Chapter 29.

#### **Financed Life Insurance**

This involves borrowing some or all of the premiums for general account life insurance policies (also referred to as leveraged life insurance). It is usually done by irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILITs) involving high-net-worth individuals as grantors and insureds. The grantors may make gifts to the ILITs to pay the interest.

There are several types of premium financing plans. They are usually fully collateralized and the policy's cash value is pledged as security for the loan. The borrower also may have to post additional collateral with the lender and/ or personally guarantee the loan.

The interest on such loans is considered personal interest and is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Thus, this strategy may be effective when the funds can be borrowed at an interest rate that is lower than the rate being earned on the cash value inside the policy. This may be questionable, particularly when interest rates increase significantly in the economy. These loans usually are short-term and so may have to be renegotiated with the lender. Thus, as with any short-term loans taken to finance long-term investment assets, this can be a risky strategy.

## **Substandard Risks**

Most applicants who cannot qualify for individual life insurance at standard rates can still obtain insurance on a so-called substandard (rated) basis. Life insurance underwriting has been refined and improved over the years so that increasing numbers of previously uninsurable applicants can now be afforded coverage on some reasonable basis. Furthermore, an insured who has been issued insurance on a substandard basis may subsequently learn that he or she is eligible for new insurance at standard rates or at least under better terms. Such an insured should appeal to the insurer for reconsideration of the original substandard rating.

If an applicant has been told he or she can get insurance only on a rated basis, the applicant or his or her advisers may want to check with other companies to see what kind of insurance coverage may be available from them. Reputable life insurance companies can differ in their underwriting of certain conditions, and so a lower rating or perhaps even none at all may be secured by shopping around a little.

## **Nonmedical Life Insurance**

*Nonmedical insurance* typically refers to regular life insurance issued without requiring the applicant to submit to a medical examination. The amounts of insurance that will be issued on a nonmedical basis vary by age groups, with the largest amounts being permitted at younger ages. There may be an age limit beyond which nonmedical insurance is not available.

## **What Actions Can an Uninsurable Person Take?**

First, they can see if it is possible to remove or reduce the reason for the uninsurability. Second, as just noted, they should check with several different insurers. Third, look for sources of insurance that do not require the showing of individual evidence of insurability. Group insurance, for example, may be available through the place of employment. Other groups or associations to which the person belongs may be checked to see if he or she can get association group insurance through them. However, association group coverage often requires at least some individual underwriting. Nonmedical insurance also may be available on an individual basis. Remember, though, that nonmedical insurance does involve individual underwriting. Finally, persons can sometimes qualify for life insurance on a so-called guaranteed-issue basis, where members of a group cannot be denied coverage by the insurer.

## **Group Life Insurance**

Most people who are eligible for group life insurance obtain such coverage through their place of employment. This coverage normally is term insurance.

#### **Group Term Life Insurance**

This insurance provides covered employees with pure insurance protection (with no cash values) while they are working for the employer. If an employee

leaves the employer, group term coverage normally terminates 31 days after employment ceases, subject to the right of the employee to convert the group insurance to an individual permanent life insurance contract. This conversion privilege is discussed later. Group term coverage may also continue during retirement in reduced amounts and in certain other situations.

## **Elective Group Coverages**

Employers may make several group life plans available to their employees. Such arrangements may specify that an employee must sign up for a basic plan to be eligible to elect coverage under one or more other group plans. Such *elective plans* often include additional levels of group term insurance. Additional levels of group term insurance also usually are available under flexible-benefits (cafeteria compensation) employee benefit plans.

### **Other Group Plans**

**Group Universal Life Plans (GULPs)** These plans are made available to employees on a voluntary basis, with the employees able to decide, within limits, how much life insurance they wish to purchase and how much in premiums they wish to contribute to the savings element of the plan. Participating employees may withdraw their cash values from the plan, take policy loans against them, and upon termination of employment, continue the coverage by making premium payments directly to the insurance company. The insured employees pay the full cost of a GULP from their after-tax pay (on a salary withholding basis).

**Survivor Income Plans** Another type of employer-employee group plan is one designed to provide a monthly income that becomes payable to surviving dependents specified in the plan upon the death of an employee.

## **Conversion Rights**

An insured employee has the right to convert, up to the face amount of his or her group term life insurance, to an individual policy of permanent insurance under certain conditions. Typically, the employee can convert within 31 days after termination of employment to one of the insurer's regular permanent forms at standard rates for his or her attained age without evidence of insurability. For employees who are in poor health or even uninsurable, this can be a valuable provision.

#### **Coverage After Retirement**

Today, some group life plans continue at least some coverage after retirement.

## **How Much Life Insurance Is Needed?**

This question often perplexes consumers. Unfortunately, there is no one answer. It obviously depends on the purpose or purposes for which the insurance is intended.

**Estate Planning and Business Insurance Needs** For estate liquidity and conservation purposes, the amount of life insurance needed depends on the size of the estate or estates involved, the potential estate shrinkage, any other liquid assets or arrangements available, and the person's overall estate plan, as explained in Chapter 29. The person or couple also may have other estate-planning goals involving life insurance, such as the possible establishment of a dynasty trust, replacement of family wealth going to charity under charitable remainder trusts, or other charitable giving needs. These possible needs are covered throughout the book.

For business life insurance needs, it depends on the owners' goals for their business, on the business values involved, and on the particular business plans adopted, as explained in Chapter 31. Life insurance also is commonly used in business compensation planning. The amounts needed for this depend on compensation levels, the plans involved, and other factors.

**Family Protection Needs** The traditional function of life insurance has been to protect a person's loved ones in the event of his or her death. For this purpose, most people with an earned income and family or personal responsibilities need life insurance protection. A number of approaches are used, or have been used, to estimate the amount of life insurance needed for family protection.9 The main ones are described next.

*A Justification for Approximation:* Before discussing specific approaches, it may be noted that in determining these amounts, approximation is quite acceptable for several reasons. First, family needs, available resources, and other factors are estimated far into the future, and who knows what the future will bring? Second, with our mobile society, family structures and needs will change in many cases. Third, investment returns may be used in these calculations, and who knows what these will be in the future? Fourth, inflation (or deflation) may also affect future needs, and that is another imponderable. Finally, the cost of term life insurance, particularly for younger persons who normally have the greatest family protection needs, is quite low today, so it often doesn't cost too much to be a little conservative in estimating the amount of life insurance needed.

<sup>9</sup>An excellent discussion of this subject can be found in *McGill's Life Insurance*, Edward E. Graves, ed. (The American College, 1994).

*Just Buying an Arbitrary Amount of Insurance:* Sometimes consumers are presented with proposals to buy a stated amount of insurance without really evaluating their needs. This is not a logical approach from a planning perspective. Of course, it probably is better than nothing if the coverage is otherwise needed.

*A Multiple of Gross Earnings:* This is a rough approximation of needs. The person is asked to buy, say, from 6 to 10 times his or her annual earnings. The multiple can be roughly estimated from the person's family situation and perceived needs. This approach is easy to use, but is only a general approximation.

*An Earnings Replacement and Cash Needs Approach:* This is a more complete but more complicated approach. The goal is to estimate the amount of capital needed to replace each spouse's or person's personal earnings if he or she were to die today. This process starts with each person's gross annual earnings from their personal efforts.

Then, taking each person separately when they are both working outside the home, estimate what percentage of gross earnings should be continued to survivors if the person were to die. This percentage often is around 70 to 80 percent. The concept behind this is that some annual outlays will not continue after the person's death, but others (like child-care expenses) may increase.

The third step is to estimate what existing sources of income will be available after the person's death. These sources may include annual earnings of a surviving spouse, Social Security survivorship benefits, investment income, pension survivorship benefits, and other income sources.

The fourth step is to subtract the existing sources of income to the survivors from the gross income desired for the survivors to arrive at any deficit in the amount of annual income desired.

The fifth step is to convert this deficit into a lump-sum amount of capital needed to meet the earnings replacement need. This is a difficult step, and advisers differ on the technique to be used. Some argue that only enough capital is needed to take care of the deficit until the youngest child finishes college or graduate school. Others argue that this capital fund should be used up (liquidated) over the surviving spouse's life expectancy or some other period. However, the technique favored by the authors is a simple capitalization-ofincome approach using a conservative interest rate that may reflect assumed inflation. This approach assumes the capital fund is to remain intact over the surviving spouse's lifetime and then be passed on to the children or others at the surviving spouse's death. This approach is more conservative and will produce a need for more life insurance, but it is defended on the grounds that the future is uncertain and unexpected needs may arise.

Next, the cash needs that will exist after the person's death are considered. These may include an emergency fund, a mortgage and other debt liquidation fund, and an education fund, depending on the circumstances.

Finally, the lump-sum personal earnings replacement need and the cash needs are combined, and then the person's other assets and present life insurance coverage are subtracted from the total need for coverage to determine the amount of new life insurance (if any) the person needs.

The same analysis should be repeated for each person involved. Each person should be considered separately because they will have different earnings, resources, and perhaps needs.

If one spouse works in the home while the other works outside the home, this analysis can be done for the spouse working outside the home. Then the need for a child-care fund and the other expenses that will be necessary in the event of the death of the spouse working in the home can be determined. This will provide the basis for estimating the amount of life insurance needed on that spouse's life.

Fortunately, it normally is not necessary for consumers to perform these calculations for themselves. Life insurance agents, brokers, insurance companies, and other advisers often have computer programs that will use this approach (or one like it) or the programming approach described next to make recommendations to consumers as to how much life insurance they need.

*Programming or Needs Approach:* For many years, this approach was the main method used in the marketplace for determining how much life insurance a person should have. It is more detailed than the method just described because it takes into consideration changes in the income stream for the family over the years.10 However, in recent years, the programming approach has not been used nearly as much as it once was.11

*Human Life Value Approach:* This approach attempts to measure the economic worth of an individual to his or her family. It was popularized many years ago (1924) in the writings of Dr. Solomon S. Huebner, who was a pioneer in insurance education. However, it has not been used in practice for many years and so will not be described here.12

10For example, Social Security survivorship benefits will cease when the youngest child reaches age 18 or 19 and will not begin again until the surviving spouse reaches age 60 (or the full benefit age for full benefits). This is commonly called the Social Security *gap* or *blackout period.* 11For a complete discussion of this and related methods, see *Life and Health Insurance,* 13th ed., by Kenneth Black, Jr., and Harold D. Skipper, Jr. (Prentice-Hall, 2000). The fifth edition of this book may also be helpful.

## **Life Settlement Transactions**

These are transactions involving the sale of a life insurance policy to a thirdparty purchaser for an amount normally significantly larger than the policy's cash value. Such sales are economically feasible for the third-party purchaser because the insured is determined to be in poor health and normally is expected to die in 7 to 8 years.

The life settlement companies typically originate the transactions but then generally pool the purchased policies and sell interests in the pooled contracts to investors. Thus, it is argued that the investors (who stand to profit from the early deaths of the insureds whose policies were purchased) do not know who these insureds are.

For policies to be eligible for a life settlement purchase, the insured normally must be over age 60 or 65, be in poor health, and the policy must be in force in a sound insurance company. The life settlement company normally requests medical information from a prospective seller to evaluate how much, if anything, it will offer for the policy. In effect, it is underwriting in reverse of what a life insurance company does when it is deciding whether to issue a policy on an applicant for life insurance. If the situation meets their standards, life settlement companies then offer the policyowner a purchase price that well exceeds the policy's cash value. If the company purchases a policy, it will continue to pay the premiums necessary to keep the policy in force until the issue dies when it will collect the death proceeds from the insurer for its investors.

Such a policy purchase is a transfer for a valuable consideration for federal income tax purposes. Therefore, the policy's death proceeds are not income taxâ€“free [under Section 101(a) of the IRC], but rather the death proceeds less the life settlement company's basis in the policy (its purchase price plus the premiums it has paid) is ordinary taxable income to the company. This is an example of the transfer for value rule described further in Chapter 29.

For the policyowner-seller, the difference between the amount he or she received from the sale less his or her basis in its contract (net premium paid) is taxable income. Thus, the seller receives the price paid by the life settlement company less the tax payable due to the sale. Of course, if the policyowner had surrendered the policy for cash to the insurer, he or she similarly would have received ordinary income equal to the difference between the cash value (a lower figure) and his or her basis in the contract. On the other hand, if the policyowner-insured retained the policy until death (perhaps financing the premium payments), his or her beneficiary would receive the entire policy proceeds (face amount) income taxâ€“free. Thus, in a potential life settlement situation, the real choice would seem to be whether to sell the policy or retain it until death. This is a rather controversial issue. Most life settlement transactions involve UL or term policies.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Peter Impaired, age 65, has recently retired as an executive from Able Corporation, because of poor health. He owns a \$5,000,000 UL policy with a \$600,000 cash value. Peter has paid \$500,000 in premiums for this policy. He feels he needs additional retirement income, does not want to pay future premiums, and so wants to terminate the UL policy. After reviewing the situation, Peter's financial adviser has contacted a number of life settlement companies and, after submitting medical information on Peter's health situation to them, has received several life settlement offers ranging from \$700,000 to \$1,100,000. Peter decides to accept the \$1,100,000 offer and so sells his UL policy to that company. This is a sale of life insurance for a valuable consideration so the difference between the amount Peter receives (\$1,100,000) and his basis in the policy (the \$500,000 of net premiums paid), or \$600,000, is taxable to Peter.
