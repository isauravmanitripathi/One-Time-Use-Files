## **Basic Investment Objective**

The basic objective of most people is to earn the maximum possible total, after-tax rate of return on the funds available for investment, consistent with the investment limitations and constraints under which they must operate. In other words, most investors want to earn as much on their investments as they can relative to the level of risk they can assume. In general, the higher the expected returns on an asset class (e.g., common stocks, bonds, cash equivalents, real estate, and so forth), the greater the level of investment risk. This is referred to as the *risk-return tradeoff* (i.e., to get greater returns, the investor normally must assume greater risk). Obviously, the level of risk investors should assume varies greatly, depending on a host of factors, including their status within their economic lifecycle. For example, a young couple with both parties having successful careers outside the home normally can assume more investment risk than a couple with both parties age 65, who have just retired.

## **Investment Theories**

Before discussing the specific factors involved in the choice of an investment portfolio and the characteristics, uses, and taxation of various investment vehicles (asset classes), it will be helpful to consider some investment theories that shape investment thinking today.

#### **Modern Portfolio Theory**

Investment thinking today is largely based on modern portfolio theory (MPT), which was pioneered by Professor Harry Markowitz in 1952.1 MPT is also the basis for the *prudent investor rule,* which is the common legal standard today for the investment of trust funds, as explained in Chapter 25.

Prior to the development of MPT, investments for a portfolio were evaluated individually based on their individual characteristics of risk and return. Risk (and return) was considered on an asset by asset basis. Thus, some investments, or even asset classes, might have been regarded as "too risky" or "too speculative" to be included in a portfolio, regardless of what other assets were in the portfolio. This thinking also was important support for the "prudent man standard" (and particularly the "legal list rules") that formerly governed trust investment law, again as explained in Chapter 25.

On the other hand, MPT focuses on the expected returns, risk, and correlations (or covariance) among asset classes for the portfolio as a whole. It evaluates total portfolio risk rather than the risk presented by each component in the portfolio. Thus, the overall objective of MPT is to achieve the highest possible return on the whole portfolio for an acceptable level of risk (which depends on the investor's characteristics, objectives, and tolerance for risk). Or, stated somewhat differently, for a given level of risk, the rational investor will seek to organize his or her portfolio to secure the greatest expected return. This is accomplished through *efficient diversification* of the portfolio.

**Expected Returns** The *expected returns* considered in MPT are often based on long-term historical average (mean) annual total returns for different asset classes (such as, average annual returns on a common stock index, government bonds, and cash equivalents for a long period, such as 1926 through the present). Other estimates of expected returns may also be used. These expected returns often assume reinvestment of income and do not consider investment expenses or taxes. Naturally, it is impossible to know what future returns on any asset class will be. Thus, expected returns are difficult to determine. But many analysts believe that long-term experience over various economic cycles and events is the best guide. Of course, any analysis is only as good as the validity of the inputs going into it, and clearly, the length and representativeness of any historical period used will have a major impact on the validity of the expected returns produced.

<sup>1</sup> See, for example, Dr. Markowitz's seminal article, "Portfolio Selection," *Journal of Finance*  7, No. 1 (March 1952), pp. 77-91.

**Risk** In this context, *risk* is defined as the variation of actual returns for an individual investment, an asset class, or a portfolio around their expected returns. Thus, risk is the *variance*, or dispersion, of investment returns.<sup>2</sup> Note that variance includes both positive (gains) and negative (losses) percentage variations from the average (i.e., expected returns). Another concept is *semivariance*, which measures only negative percentage variations from the average.

Standard Deviation and Related Concepts: The main measurement of risk is the statistical concept of the standard deviation. The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion (or distance from the average) of a series of returns (such as investment returns).<sup>3</sup> The greater the standard deviation, the greater the potential variation of actual returns from expected returns (average returns), and hence the greater the investment risk.

For example, assume that over the previous 40 years a portfolio consisting entirely of large-cap common stocks (as measured by, say, the S&P 500 index) had an average annual total return (expected return) of 10 percent and a standard deviation of 18 percent. On the other hand, assume that over the same period a portfolio consisting entirely of long-term U.S. government bonds had an average annual total return (expected return) of 6 percent and a standard deviation of 11 percent. Given these numbers, the next question might be within what range of the expected returns might we expect the actual returns in any given year (i.e., period) to fall? In other words, what is the likely maximum level of dispersion of the actual returns around the expected returns in a given year?

This is a question of probabilities. Statistical theory tells us that assuming a normal distribution of items (in this case, annual investment returns), the probabilities are that approximately two-thirds (say, 67 percent) of the items will fall within plus or minus one standard deviation of the arithmetic mean (average), approximately 95 percent will fall within plus or minus two standard deviations of the arithmetic mean, while approximately 99 percent will fall within three standard deviations. These are known as confidence intervals. Therefore, based on these probabilities, we can estimate that almost all (95 percent) of the actual annual total returns will fall within plus or minus two standard deviations of the expected (average) return. Thus, there is a 95 percent probability that the common stock portfolio's actual annual total returns will range from a gain of 46 percent (10 percent expected return +

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>2</sup>Technically, *variance* is the sum of the squared percentage deviations from the mean. The mathematical formula for the variance of returns is  $\sigma^2 = E[r - E(r)]^2$ .

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>3</sup>Technically, the *standard deviation* is the square root of the variance, or  $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$ . Actual calculations of the variance and standard deviation are beyond the scope of this book.

36 percent for two standard deviations) to a loss of 26 percent (10 percent expected return – 36 percent for two standard deviations). The corresponding range for the government bond portfolio would be from an annual gain of 28 percent (6 percent expected return 22 percent for two standard deviations) to an annual loss of 16 percent (6 percent expected return – 22 percent for two standard deviations). Thus, the hypothetical stock portfolio has a greater expected return but involves more risk than the bond portfolio.

It may be noted that these probabilities (confidence intervals) assume a normal distribution of variable items (annual investment returns) around the arithmetic mean of the items. A *normal distribution* is a bell-shaped frequency distribution of the items, with approximately an equal range of items above and below the mean (average) item. A distribution is *skewed* when there is a greater range of items either above or below the mean. In other words, the skewed distribution is not bell-shaped but has a "tail" of items extending either above or below the mean. The concept of *Kurtosis* refers to the shape of the distribution (i.e., how pointed or flat the frequency distribution is).

A distribution may also be a *lognormal distribution*, which is a probability distribution of items whose logarithms are normally distributed. If items are determined to be lognormally distributed, the geometric mean (e.g., average annual compound rates of return) and the geometric standard deviation can be used to estimate confidence intervals, as shown previously.

As just explained, the standard deviation is a commonly used measure of total investment risk. However, some cautions on such use might be noted.

First, the data used to calculate expected returns and standard deviations ideally should cover a relatively long period that encompasses a variety of economic conditions (prosperity, recession, depression, peace, and war). Periods that are not representative of differing economic conditions can produce misleading results that may not be duplicated in the future. Furthermore, the standard deviation normally measures anticipated *annual deviations* from the mean (expected returns). However, common stock "bear markets" often last longer than one year and produce steeper declines (from peak to trough) than one year's standard deviations. For example, the "bear market" at the start of the Great Depression of the 1930s lasted 35 months (from the peak in September 1929 to the trough in July 1932) and resulted in an 89 percent decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during that time. It took 25 years (until November 1954) for the market to recover to its previous peak of September 1929. In the post–World War II period, to take a more recent example, the severe "bear market" that started in January 1973 (peak) and lasted until December 1974 (trough) had a duration of 23 months and resulted in a decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 45 percent. This time, it took the market 95 months to return to its previous high.<sup>4</sup> The suggestion here is that the use of the statistical concept of the standard deviation to measure risk should be tempered with consideration of what history has taught us about past severe bear markets.

A statistical measure related to the standard deviation is the *coefficient of variation*  $(Cv)$ . It is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of a distribution of data, and is often expressed as a percentage.<sup>5</sup> It may be referred to as the relative standard deviation or the percentage standard deviation. This measure will result in a single number (a percentage) that may be useful for comparison purposes in certain situations.

Beta: Another important statistical measure of investment risk is the beta coefficient or beta. This measures the volatility of the market prices of an individual common stock, a portfolio of stocks, or a mutual fund relative to those of a given market index (which may represent the whole market or a segment of the market).

The idea is that when market prices as a whole (which have a beta of 1) go up or down, the prices of individual stocks or mutual funds correspondingly may go up or down more than or less than those of the market as a whole, or they may move in sync with the market. This volatility relationship is measured by the stock's or fund's beta.<sup>6</sup> Thus, for example, if a stock or fund has a beta of 1.5 relative to the Wilshire 5000 Stock Index, it is more volatile (risky) than the index (representing most of the market), so if the Wilshire 5000 declines, say, by 10 percent, it is expected that the subject stock or fund will decline by 1.5 times that, or 15 percent. Correspondingly, if the Wilshire 5000 should go up, say, by 20 percent, the subject stock or fund should increase by 30 percent (20%  $\times$  1.5). Similarly, if a stock or fund has a beta of 0.75 relative to the Wilshire 5000, it is less volatile (risky) than the index and so is expected to move only 0.75 (75 percent) of any increase or decrease in the Wilshire 5000. If a stock or fund has a beta of 1, it is expected to move to the same degree as the market index. In a few cases, a stock or fund may move in the opposite direction to the market in general. Such stocks or funds might have a negative beta.

**R-Squared** (Coefficient of Determination): This is a statistical measure that indicates the fraction of the variance of a dependent variable (e.g., return

<sup>5</sup> In this case, its mathematical formula would be  $Cv = \frac{\sigma}{N}$  (100) where  $\sigma$  is the standard deviation and  $N$  is the mean.

<sup>6</sup> Technically, the beta ( $\beta$ ) is the standard deviation of the individual stock or fund ( $\sigma$ <sub>i</sub>) divided by the standard deviation of the market index  $(\sigma_m)$  and then multiplied by the correlation coefficient between the individual stock or fund and the market index [Corr  $(\sigma_{\cdot}, \sigma_{\cdot})$ ]. Thus, the formula for beta is  $\beta = \sigma/\sigma_{\rm m}$  [Corr ( $\sigma_{\rm o}$ ,  $\sigma_{\rm m}$ )] The concept of correlation is discussed next in this chapter. Again, the actual calculation of the beta is beyond the scope of this book.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>4</sup>Data on common stock bear market durations, percentage declines, and recovery periods are presented in Chapter 5.

on a stock or mutual fund) that is explained by the variance of an independent variable (such as the return on a stock market index). Thus, for example, it measures how much of a stock's or fund's past returns can be explained by the returns of the market generally (as measured by a stock market index). In the unlikely event that a stock's or fund's past total returns moved exactly with those of the index, its R-squared (R2 ) would be 1.

It has been suggested that a fund's beta is related to its R2 . Since R2 indicates the degree of correspondence (correlation) of returns of a fund and the index, it also indicates how reliable the beta is in measuring the fund's price volatility. The higher the R2 , the more reliable the beta; the lower the R2 , the less reliable the beta.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

The use of some of these statistical measures in wealth management can be shown by the following situation.

Mark Schwartz is age 55 and would like to retire in about five years. He and his wife Alice, age 53, own about \$2,000,000 worth of various mutual funds and common stocks. These include seven mutual funds with several different investment objectives and eight individual common stocks. The overall portfolio is allocated more than 90 percent in common stock funds and common stocks. Mark and Alice are concerned about the current economic environment, particularly in light of their planned retirement in just five years. They would like to have some idea of how much investment risk they are assuming and what their expected investment returns might be. Their investment adviser has prepared a report for them covering their asset allocation, portfolio characteristics, and the characteristics of individual securities in the portfolio to evaluate their risk-return situation, among other things.

Just as examples, the report contains the following statistical information on two of their mutual funds (along with much more information).

| R-Squared                             | 0.78                                |        |                      | 0.88     |  |

In addition, the report gives the following statistical information on their overall portfolio (along with much more information).

|                      | 3 years | 5 years | 10 years |
|----------------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Mean (average annual | 14.20%  | 12.78%  | 10.38%   |
| total return)        |         |         |          |
| Standard Deviation   | 11.35%  | 15.54%  | 17.86%   |
| Beta                 | 1.21    | 1.28    | 1.32     |
| R-Squared            | 0.74    | 0.76    | 0.85     |

Just using this information, it can be seen that Fund A has had almost the same average annual total return over the last 10 years as Fund B (9.78% compared with 10.42%) and better returns for the last three years, while experiencing lower risk. Fund A's standard deviation for the last 10 years was 13.84, while Fund B's was 19.96. Thus, Fund A experienced less variation from the mean (investment risk) than Fund B. Similarly, Fund A's beta (e.g., compared with a broad market index) was less than 1 (i.e., 0.84), while Fund B's beta was substantially greater than 1 (i.e., 1.48). Meaning that the prices of Fund B are more volatile relative to the index then those of Fund A. Furthermore, the R2 of Fund A is somewhat higher than that of Fund B, so the returns of Fund A are somewhat better correlated with the index than Fund B. Thus, from these data it would appear that at least for the last 10 years, Fund A has had a better risk-notion relationship than Fund B.

Their investment adviser also points out to Mark and Alice that the standard deviation and beta for their overall portfolio are reasonably high, indicating significant variability of returns from the mean and from the market index.

Given this information and considerable further analysis, their investment adviser suggests that Mark and Alice consider revising their asset allocation to reduce their exposure to common stocks and stock funds. He suggests they move more of their asset allocation into less volatile (less risky) asset classes, such as investment-grade bonds and bond funds. By doing so, they could reduce their overall portfolio risk (as measured by the portfolio's standard deviation) while not greatly reducing their portfolio's expected return. That is, while overall expected return can be expected to decline (because long-term returns on investmentgrade bonds normally are lower than on common stocks), portfolio risk will decline proportionally more. This is because the price movements of common stocks and bonds are poorly or even negatively correlated (i.e., they do not move together).

**Cautions on Use of Statistical Measures** Some cautions concerning the use of standard deviations have already been noted. It also should be borne in mind that these are theoretical measures based on past experience, which may or may not be repeated in the future. Also, betas may change over time. Investment research has indicated that, over time, betas tend to move toward the market beta of 1 (which is referred to as "regressing to the mean"). Also, as noted previously, betas should be analyzed in conjunction with the R2 measure of correlation of returns to the market.

Furthermore, measures of expected returns and the standard deviations are more reliable when taken over reasonably long time periods (such as at least 10 years). It is interesting to observe that the returns for mutual funds with similar investment objectives tend to move much closer together when viewed over a 10-year time span.

The main point is that while these statistical measures can provide useful insights concerning risk and return, they are only part of the analytical picture. Their use should be tempered with sound judgment based on the facts of the particular case, the time horizons and other investment constraints involved, and the perceived general economic and investment climate.

**Capital Market Line (CML)** We have noted that there is always a tradeoff between risk and return in investing. Investment theorists illustrate this by considering a portfolio consisting of a risk-free asset (such as U.S. Treasury bills or insured bank accounts) and a hypothetical "risky" asset consisting of an optimal portfolio of all "risky" assets. The expected returns and risks (as measured by the standard deviation) of all combinations of these two assets are plotted on a straight line called the *capital allocation line (CAL)*. This is part of the threshold decision of how much of a portfolio should be allocated to safe but low-yielding assets and how much to riskier assets, such as common stocks or real estate. This sometimes is referred to as the capital allocation decision.

![](_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 4.1.** Capital Market Line (CML)

The capital market line (CML) is a capital allocation line that shows the expected returns and risk of all combinations of a risk-free asset (e.g., 30-day Treasury bills) and a broad market index of common stocks. The expected return and standard deviation for the common stocks are from long-term historical studies. The same is true for the expected return for the T-bills, but since they are the risk-free asset, their standard deviation is assumed to be zero.

Figure 4.1 shows such a capital market line. The vertical axis shows the expected returns and the horizontal axis the risk (as measured by the standard deviations). A portfolio of 100 percent T-bills would have an expected return of 3.7 percent and an assumed standard deviation of zero (i.e., is risk-free, although in reality 30-day bills would have some variability). A 100 percent common stock portfolio would have an expected return of 12 percent and a standard deviation of 20.6 percent. The various combinations of these two assets corresponding to the points on the line between these limits would have correspondingly weighted returns and risk.

The risk premium of an asset or asset class is the difference between its expected return and that of risk-free assets. It compensates the investor for the risk inherent in the "risky" asset. In this example, the risk premium is 8.3 percent (or 12 percent expected return on common stocks less 3.7 percent risk-free return on T-bills).7

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>7</sup> Another measure used in this context is the reward-to-variability ratio. This is the risk premium divided by the standard deviation, and it shows the increase in expected return for each point of standard deviation. In this example, it would be  $8.3 \div 20.6 = 0.403$ . It also is the slope of the CAL or CML.

A variation of the CML is sometimes used by analysts to show the riskreturn characteristics of other asset classes (such as alternative investments) in comparison to, say, combinations of the risk-free asset and common stocks. The idea is to show how such asset classes might fit into an investment portfolio in terms of risk and return.

**Covariance and Correlation Coefficient (Correlation)** It was noted previously that modern portfolio theory is concerned with expected return and risk for a portfolio as a whole (portfolio risk-return) rather than for individual securities considered separately. The goal is to achieve the best return possible on the entire portfolio for a given level of risk. This risk level depends on the individual investor's personal circumstances and risk aversion. In this context, the concepts of covariance and the correlation coefficient are important.

*Covariance* (or correlation) is a number (such as 80) indicating the degree to which the returns of two assets or asset classes move with each other. A positive covariance means the returns move together, while a negative covariance means they move in opposite directions. The size of the number indicates the intensity of the correlation.

The *correlation coefficient* is an easier number to use in analysis because it measures correlation between 1 (the returns move exactly in the same direction or are perfectly correlated) and 1 (the returns move exactly in opposite directions or are perfectly negatively correlated).8 Thus, if there were two common stocks in the same industry with a correlation coefficient of 1 (an unlikely event), when one stock increases in price by, say, 20 percent, the other also will increase by 20 percent, and when one declines in price by 20 percent, the other also will fall by 20 percent. On the other hand, if one stock was an oil exploration company and the other a manufacturer of solar panels and they had a correlation coefficient of 1 (an equally unlikely event), when one stock increases in price by, say, 20 percent, the other will decline in price by the same 20 percent, and when the first stock declines, the other will rise by the same percentage.

Correlations normally fall somewhere between 1 and 1. If the correlation coefficient lies between 1 and 0, the assets are positively correlated, and the size of the correlation coefficient (how close it is to 1) indicates the degree of correlation. If the correlation coefficient lies between 0 and 1, the assets are negatively correlated (inversely correlated). Most assets and asset classes are positively correlated, but the degrees of correlation can vary considerably. For example, for a given period, the S&P 500 stock index may have a

<sup>8</sup>Technically, the correlation coefficient between two items is their covariance divided by the product of their standard deviations. However, such calculations are beyond the scope of this book.

0.81 correlation coefficient with the MSCI EAFE index,9 indicating a relatively high positive correlation. On the other hand, for the same period, the S&P 500 may have a 0.50 correlation coefficient with an index of fund of hedge funds, indicating a positive but much lower degree of correlation. In fact, one of the arguments for including hedge funds in an asset allocation (if eligible to do so) is that they may have relatively low correlations with other asset classes (such as common stocks), yet may have relatively attractive expected returns. Hence, they may lower portfolio risk relative to their possible returns. (Hedge funds and private equity are discussed further in Chapter 8.) As a final example, the S&P 500 stock index may have a –0.21 correlation coefficient with intermediate-term U.S. Treasury notes, indicating a negative correlation. This may demonstrate a countercyclical movement in stock and bond prices (i.e., during the business cycle, when the market prices of stocks fall, such as during a recession, the market prices of investment-grade bonds may rise), as noted in Chapter 7.

**Efficient Frontier** We noted previously that the risk-return characteristics for an asset or asset class can be shown by its expected return (mean) and variance of returns around the mean or risk (as measured by the standard deviation). However, for a portfolio of assets or asset classes, the risk-return characteristics for the whole portfolio depend not only on the expected returns and variance of returns of the assets or asset classes individually, but also on the covariance (correlation) of the assets or asset classes to each other.

This covariance factor usually results in a reduction of portfolio risk through diversification. The expected return of a portfolio is equal to the weighted arithmetic average return of the assets or asset classes in the portfolio. However, the variance of returns of the portfolio (or portfolio standard deviation) will be less than the weighted arithmetic average standard deviation of the assets or asset classes in the portfolio, provided these assets or asset classes have a correlation coefficient of less than 1 (i.e., are not perfectly correlated with each other). As noted previously, assets or asset classes are almost never perfectly correlated. This general concept can be referred to as *efficient diversification*. Also, the lower the level of correlation among the assets or asset classes in the portfolio, the lower the overall portfolio variance (risk) will be. This is the theoretical basis for including otherwise risky assets or asset classes in a portfolio provided they have low correlations (or possibly are even uncorrelated, i.e., have a negative correlation coefficient) with the other assets in the portfolio.

#### **Basic Investment Planning and Strategies**

The efficient frontier is a graph showing a given set of assets or asset classes with the lowest possible portfolio variance for the expected return for each possible combination of the assets or asset classes. This also may be referred to as the *minimum-variance frontier* or *mean-variance optimization*.

The inputs for this frontier are the expected returns, variances (standard deviations), and covariances (correlation coefficients) for the assets or asset classes involved. As stated previously, these inputs usually are taken from historical data. This means the historical period selected can have a major impact on the outcomes. Sometimes, the inputs are based on a scenario analysis where logical estimates are made of possible returns or are based on market forecasts made for the data by the preparer of the frontier or others. There also are many computer programs that can generate efficient frontiers from the inputs for specified assets or asset classes.

Figure 4.2 is an example of an efficient frontier (with inputs based on historical data) for a common-stock large-cap index and 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. This frontier is the set of portfolios that for any given expected return (mean) on the vertical axis will produce the lowest standard deviation (risk) on the horizontal axis. As noted previously, this may be referred to as the variance minimization approach, or *mean-variance optimization*. Alternatively, the frontier shows the portfolio for any given risk level (standard deviation) that will produce the greatest expected return. The two approaches produce the same result. These concepts that developed a formalized diversification theory were first put forward by Professor Harry Markowitz in 1952. He earned the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1990 for this work.

#### **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**

This controversial theory attained prominence in the 1960s and has continued to be advanced since then, particularly in academic circles. It holds that common stock prices already reflect all information available to market participants and, therefore, it is not possible to consistently outperform the market using such information.

When new information emerges (such as mergers or dividend increases), stock prices will be affected, but they will adjust quickly to new values based on the new information. Thus, stock prices will be affected only by new, unpredictable information and the resulting effect in stock prices will be random and unpredictable (i.e., not discoverable through security analysis). Some have referred to this idea as stock prices following a *random walk*.

Depending on the form of EMH being advanced, it suggests that those efforts to pick undervalued securities (fundamental analysis and value investing) and to pick stocks based on their past price movements (technical analysis) generally are fruitless in an efficient market. It also would seem to favor passive investment approaches (such as index investing) and pursuing a buy-and-hold strategy in common stock investing generally. Thus, this theory argues against active stock management and security analysis.

**Forms of Efficient Market Hypothesis** Proponents of EMH are not uniform in how they apply the theory, particularly in terms of what information is presumed to be "available." There are three forms of EMH: weak, semistrong, and strong.

*Weak Form:* As its name implies, this is the least vigorous application of the theory. It assumes that stock prices already reflect publicly available information concerning past stock prices, trading volumes, and similar data. Therefore, technical analysis (attempting to predict future stock price movements from their past movements) cannot be effective in producing superior returns, but fundamental analysis (security analysis) can identify stocks that are temporarily undervalued or overvalued, allowing investors to profit from such analysis.

*Semistrong Form:* This form tightens the theory considerably and assumes that stock prices already reflect all publicly available information concerning the companies and their stocks. This would include information commonly used in security analysis, such as financial statements, product lines, market shares, management information, earnings forecasts, and so forth. Therefore, neither technical analysis nor fundamental analysis can be effective in producing superior results. This form does allow, however, that private information

#### **Basic Investment Planning and Strategies 95**

(e.g., held by corporate insiders) may allow holders of such information to earn superior returns because such information is not already reflected in stock prices. Of course, as noted in Chapter 1, trading on such insider information is often illegal, but as a practical matter, determining and proving insider trading may be difficult.

*Strong Form:* This is the most extreme (and controversial) form of EMH. It holds that stock prices already reflect all information (public and private) concerning companies and their stocks.

*Anomalies of EMH:* EMH theory is quite controversial, particularly in its strong form. Critics suggest there are reasons for market inefficiencies, such as slow diffusion of information and the power of some market participants. They also note that some sophisticated investors seem to consistently outperform the market over a significant period. Warren Buffett, for example, has been a critic of EMH.

Some who believe in security analysis (such as value investors) also argue that markets are not inherently efficient, but are often irrational so that prices of stocks can vary significantly from their true or intrinsic values. This group suggests that irrational behavior by market participants is, in fact, the norm. Thus, fundamental analysis can produce superior returns. This may be particularly true at the end of a bull market (when many investors are irrationally optimistic) or of a bear market (when they are irrationally pessimistic).

Finally, behavioral finance teaches that market participants may be driven by irrational psychological factors in addition to rational economic analysis. Behavioral economics and finance were discussed in Chapter 2.

### **Investment, Speculation, and Gambling**

At one time, it was common to draw a rather sharp distinction between *investment* and *speculation*. For example, high-grade bonds were considered investments, while common stocks were viewed as speculative. Now, however, such distinctions are passé, and high-quality ("blue-chip") common stocks generally are looked upon as investment-grade securities. Also, as we have seen from the previous section, modern portfolio theory views risk in terms of the whole portfolio rather than in terms of individual assets or asset classes.

In general, however, the term *speculation* probably can be used to mean the purchase of securities or other assets involving the assumption of considerable risk in the hope that they will produce similarly large profits in a comparatively short time. In other words, the speculator takes considerable risk in the hope of immediate and sizeable gains.

Are prudent investors to avoid speculation, as we have just defined it? The answer seems to be "not necessarily"; it depends on such things as how much of the total investment portfolio the investor wants to risk in speculation, what other kinds of assets are available for the family, how good the investor or his or her advisers are at speculating, and whether the investor has the temperament to take speculative losses as well as speculative gains. Thus, a modest portion of a portfolio, say, 5 to 10 percent, might be allocated to speculative assets. However, it also seems reasonable to say that most people are not prepared to speculate successfully. They generally are better off investing more conservatively for the long term.

Gambling, on the other hand, involves creating the risk by the transaction itself. In playing roulette, for example, there is no risk until the player puts his or her money on, for example, the red seven. But when a speculator buys a hot new stock issue in hopes of a quick profit, the stock already presents a business risk and the speculator is simply assuming it in hopes of considerable gain.

## **Factors in the Choice of Investments**

A number of factors may be considered when choosing among categories of investments or individual investments. Some of these are listed below.

- N Security of principal and income
- N Rate of return (yield)
- N Marketability and liquidity
- N Diversification
- N Tax status
- N Size of investment units or denominations
- N Use as collateral for loans
- N Protection against creditor's claims
- N Callability
- N Freedom from care

The following sections discuss these factors in detail.

#### **Security of Principal and Income**

For many investors, security of principal and income is of paramount importance. They want to be able to get their money back or not lose money on their investments. But when this factor is analyzed more closely, other questions arise, such as what kinds of "security" and over what time frame. Thus, investors and their advisers really need to keep in mind a number of different types of risks to investment values.

#### **Types of Investment Risk**

**Systematic and Unsystematic Risks** This category broadly defines and separates risks that remain after diversification (i.e., are *nondiversifiable*), which are called *systematic risks*, and those that can be reduced or even eliminated by diversification (i.e., are *diversifiable*) and are called *unsystematic risks*. Systematic risks are also referred to as *market risks*, while unsystematic risks are called nonmarket risks or *firm-specific risks*. Thus, market risk implies price fluctuations for a whole securities market, regardless of the financial soundness or investment merits of individual securities. Bull and bear markets (when most stocks go up or down at the same time) are examples of this phenomenon.

Some other types of systematic risk are discussed next.

**Interest Rate Risk** This risk involves price changes of existing investments because of changes in the general level of interest rates in the capital markets. In general, a rise in general market interest rates tends to cause a decline in market prices for existing securities; conversely, a decline in interest rates tends to cause a rise in market prices for existing securities. Thus, market prices for existing securities tend to move inversely with changes in the general level of interest rates.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

It is not difficult to see why this is true. Assume, for example, that 10 years ago Helen Johnson purchased a newly issued, high-grade corporate bond with a 7 percent interest rate for \$1,000 (at par). The bond was to come due (mature) in 30 years. Therefore, Helen receives interest of \$70 per year from the bond. At the time she bought the bond, the prevailing level of interest rates in the capital markets for bonds of this type, grade, and duration was around 7 percent. Otherwise, this bond issue could not have been sold successfully. But in the meantime, assume the general level of interest rates in the capital markets for bonds of this type, grade, and remaining duration has risen, and now the prevailing interest rate for comparable bonds with a 20-year duration is about 9 percent.

What effect does this have on Helen's existing bond? First, the 7 percent interest rate (coupon rate) does not change. So Helen will still get interest of \$70 per year until the bond matures 20 years from now. Also, when the bond matures, Helen will get the full \$1,000 maturity value from the issuing corporation. Therefore, if Helen simply holds the bond until maturity, she will continue to receive a 7 percent return and will have lost no principal (her \$1,000). Unfortunately, however, the current market price of the bond in the bond market will have declined to somewhere near \$816.10 Why is this so? Because at about this price, the yield to maturity (in 20 years) of this bond would be 9 percent and this is the prevailing market interest rate. Therefore, since we assume investors can buy newly issued bonds at around 9 percent, the prices of existing bonds carrying lower interest rates must decline to the point where they will offer generally comparable yields to maturity for a buyer. When the market price of bonds declines in this manner below their maturity value, they are said to be selling *at a discount* and are called *market discount bonds*. 11 This decline in market price does, of course, have some impact on Helen, depending on the circumstances. In determining her current personal net worth (from her statement of financial position), the bond should be valued at \$816. If she should need or want to sell the bond or use it as collateral for a loan, it is worth only \$816 (not \$1,000). However, if Helen sells this market discount bond, she will have a capital loss for tax purposes and can engage in a *tax swap bond strategy*.

Now, what will happen if interest rates in the capital markets should decline? Assume, for example, that five years pass and during that time the prevailing interest rate for comparable bonds moves from 9 to 6 percent. This would mean that the current market price of the existing 7 percent bond with 15 years left until maturity would rise to somewhere around \$1,098 (or to a premium). Why? Because at about this price the yield to maturity (in 15 years) of this bond would be 6 percent, and this is now the prevailing market interest rate.

*Applications:* We have illustrated interest rate risk in terms of a 30-year corporate bond. Does it also apply to other types of securities? Yes! Changes in the general level of interest rates have some influence on the prices of all securities and other investments. For example, when interest rates generally rise, bonds may become more attractive than common stocks for some investors, thus exerting a downward pressure on the stock market. Higher interest rates also make it more expensive for corporations to borrow, thus lowering their profits. Correspondingly, investment real estate generally is financed by mortgage loans. Thus, higher mortgage interest rates lower the returns from real estate.

<sup>10</sup>A calculator or table shows that a 20-year bond with a 7 percent coupon rate will yield 9 percent to maturity if it is priced at \$81.60 (\$816).

<sup>11</sup>Bonds also may be originally issued at a discount from their ultimate maturity value so that some or all of their annual interest return comes from the gradually accruing increase in their value as the bond approaches maturity. These are called *original-issue discount (OID) bonds* and are of a different nature than the point being made in this section.

#### **Basic Investment Planning and Strategies 99**

Of course, the reverse is true when market interest rates fall. For example, lower interest rates generally are considered good for the stock market.

In general, prices of securities that are of high quality because of their low financial risk tend to be most affected by changes in interest rates. This is because the financial risk factor has relatively little impact on their market prices. High-grade bonds fall into this category. However, prices of other securities, such as high-quality preferred stocks and certain types of common stocks (such as high-grade utility stocks), also may be significantly influenced by changes in interest rates.

Furthermore, the longer the maturity of bonds, the more influenced their prices will be by changes in market interest rates. This is because once a bond matures, it will be paid off by the issuer at par, regardless of the prevailing level of interest rates. Thus, for example, a 30-year U.S. Treasury bond will be much more affected by interest rate risk than will, say, a 5-year U.S. Treasury note. In addition, bonds issued with no current interest payments (zero coupon bonds) and bonds with low coupon rates will be more affected by interest rate risk than otherwise comparable bonds with higher coupon rates. These concepts are illustrated in Table 4.1. Finally, when bonds and preferred stocks are likely to be called, they will be less affected by interest rate risk.

*Bond Duration and Interest Rate Risk:* A bond's *duration* is the weighted average maturity of the bond's cash flows. It considers current interest payments as well as maturity value in determining these cash flows. Since interest payments are received earlier than the principal at maturity, a bond's or bond portfolio's duration will be less than its maturity (when the face or par value is payable) or a bond portfolio's weighted average maturity assuming the bond or bond portfolios pay current coupon interest. For example, as of a given date, an international bond mutual fund had a weighted average maturity of 8.3 years, a weighted average duration of 6 years, and an average quality of AA (bond quality ratings are discussed in Chapter 7). On the other hand, if a bond is a zero-coupon original issue discount bond (with no current interest payments), its duration will equal its maturity (the number of years until it matures).

Portfolio managers use a bond's or bond portfolio's duration to assess its price sensitivity to interest rate risk. This sensitivity can be approximately determined by multiplying the bond's or bond portfolio's duration by the percentage point change in market interest rates. For example, for the international bond fund noted previously with a duration of 6 years, if market interest rates fall by 2 percentage points (or 200 basis points), the fund's price per share will increase about 12 percent (6 years duration r 2 percentage points 12 percent increase in price). Correspondingly, if market interest rates should rise by 1.5 percentage points (150 basis points), the fund's price will fall about 9 percent (6 r 1.5 9 percent decline in price).

Duration also can be used in bond *portfolio immunization strategy* to coordinate an investor's bond portfolio's duration with his or her needs for funds.

*Analysis: Possible Interest Rate "Shocks" and Their Convexity:* Table 4.1 shows the hypothetical volatility in market prices for 5-year Treasury notes (coupon), 10-year Treasury notes (coupon), 10-year Treasury notes (zero coupon), and 30-year Treasury bonds (coupon) in the event of 100, 200, and 300 basis point increases and decreases in market interest rates. (One percentage point of interest rate equals 100 basis points, two percentage points equal 200 basis points, and so on.)

It can be seen from Table 4.1 how bond maturity and coupon status affect interest rate risk. For example, in the face of a 200 basis point increase in market interest rates, the 5-year Treasury note's price will decline about 8.5 percent, the 10-year (coupon) Treasury note's price will decline about 14.34 percent, while the fall in price of the 30-year Treasury bond reaches 23.2 percent. This illustrates the impact of maturity on interest rate risk. Furthermore, showing the impact of coupon status, a 200 basis point increase in market interest rates will produce approximately a 14.34 percent decline in the price of the 4.75 percent 10-year (coupon) Treasury note, while it will cause, approximately, a 17.56 percent decline in price for the 10-year zero coupon note. Of course, declines in market interest rates will produce corresponding increases in bond and note prices, as shown in Table 4.1. As stated previously, the prices of fixed-income securities move inversely with market interest rates.

Another characteristic of bond valuation that can be seen from Table 4.1 is that of *bond convexity*. This means that when there is an increase in market interest rates, the decline in bond prices is less than the corresponding increase in bond prices for the same amount of decline in market interest rates. For example, if market interest rates increase by 200 basis points (2 percentage points), the 30-year Treasury bond price will decline approximately 23.2 percent, while if market rates decline by the same 200 basis points, the 30-year bond price will increase approximately 35.01 percent. This concept is called *convexity* because if the relationship between bond price and market rates were plotted in a graph, the bond price–market rate curve would be convex in shape.

*Reinvestment Risk:* From the viewpoint of maintaining the income in an investment portfolio, changes in interest rates may present a different kind of risk—the reinvestment risk. This risk can arise from bonds and preferred stocks that are *called* (redeemed) by their issuers prior to maturity when rates are lower than when they were issued or purchased, and from securities that

**Table 4.1.** Interest Rate Risk Volatility for Various U.S. Treasury Securities

These figures are based on U.S. Treasury notes and bonds as of June 2004.

U.S. Treasury securities are considered free of default risk, so they would not be subject to financial or credit risk. For U.S. investors, they also would be free of exchange rate (currency) risk. These securities are free of other risks noted later as well. However, the price changes in Table 4.1 do not account for bid-offer spreads or other market factors, so they are hypothetical in nature.

mature when interest rates are lower than they were when the maturing securities were originally issued. In both cases, the investor is presented with a principal sum, which he or she must reinvest at a lower rate than was enjoyed in the called or maturing securities.

*Redemption or Call Risk:* The issuers of callable bonds and preferred stocks normally will redeem them when comparable market interest rates fall significantly below the coupon rates being paid on the securities. As noted, this is disadvantageous for investors in callable securities because issuers will surely call them if interest rates fall, but, of course, will not do so if interest rates rise.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose Tina Rinaldi invested \$100,000 in investment-grade, 30-year municipal bonds that paid 6 percent interest (coupon rate). Thus, her interest income from the bonds was \$6,000 per year. Assume further that the bonds are callable at par (i.e., they can be redeemed by the municipality for the \$1,000 face amount of each bond) any time after 10 years from time of issue. Suppose further that 10 years after these bonds were issued, interest rates for comparable bonds (i.e., 20-year, investment-grade, callable municipal bonds) have fallen to 4 percent. Under these conditions, the municipality will call these bonds. Now Tina has her \$100,000 back, but if she wants to invest in similar bonds, she can secure only 4 percent interest, which means an income of \$4,000 per year, rather than the \$6,000 per year she enjoyed for 10 years.

It can be seen that call risk is important when investors would like to lock in current interest rates or yields for a reasonably long time, such as during their retirement years or in saving for a child's education. Strategies for dealing with call risk are discussed in Chapter 7.

*Maturity Risk:* When securities and other investments mature at a time when market interest rates are lower than those provided by the maturing investments, the investor must reinvest the proceeds at lower yields. This reinvestment risk really arises from investing in shorter-term securities and other investments.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose George and Martha Wilson place \$75,000 of their retirement savings in a three-year insured CD that pays 6 percent interest. Thus, their annual income from this CD is \$4,500. However, at the end of the three-year period, when the CD comes due and the Wilsons are ready to roll it over into a new CD, assume the economy is in recession, the Federal Reserve has pushed shorterterm interest rates down to try to stimulate a recovery, and the interest rates currently being paid on comparable CDs and other similarly secure investments are around 3 percent. Now if the Wilsons place their \$75,000 into a comparable new CD, their annual interest income will drop from \$4,500 to \$2,250, or a 50 percent decline. Of course, if shorter-term interest rates should rise, the reverse would be true and the Wilsons would be better off with their shorter-term investments.

Strategies for dealing with interest rate risk and reinvestment risk, as well as other strategies for investing in fixed-income securities, are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.

**Purchasing Power Risk** This is uncertainty over the future purchasing power of the income and principal from an investment. Purchasing power depends on changes in the general price level in the economy. When prices rise, purchasing power declines; when prices decline, purchasing power rises. As a practiced matter, however, since around 1940, the United States has experienced a rather steady inflationary trend (with an average annual increase in consumer prices of around 3 percent).

This has led many investors to seek investments whose principal and income they hope will increase during inflationary periods so that the purchasing power of their investment dollars at least will not decline. Such investments are often called *inflation hedges* and were discussed in Chapter 2.

**Exchange Rate (Currency) Risk** Investors may buy securities, have bank accounts, or have other investments that are denominated in currencies other than their own (foreign currencies). They also may own shares in investment companies (e.g., mutual funds) that invest in foreign securities or currencies (international funds) and that do not hedge against currency fluctuations. Such investors will be exposed to exchange rate risk in addition to other investment risks.

Exchange rate risk arises from market fluctuations in the value of one currency in terms of other currencies—in other words, fluctuations in how many units of one currency will be received for a unit of other currencies.

For example, as of this writing, the euro is worth \$1.4233 and the dollar is worth 107.22 yen in the foreign exchange market. Now if six months later the euro is worth \$1.50 in the foreign exchange market, the dollar would have weakened relative to the euro (because a euro will buy more dollars or, conversely, it takes more cents to buy a euro). Suppose now that a U.S. investor holds European bonds or stocks worth 100,000 euros (or owns

shares in a mutual fund that owns such securities). In this case, the investor would have gained from the currency fluctuation because previously his or her European bonds or stocks would have been worth \$142,330 (100,000 euros r \$1.4233), while six months later (assuming all other factors remain the same), they would be worth \$150,000 (100,000 euros r \$1.50).

On the other hand, using the same example, if six months later the euro is worth \$1.30, the dollar would have strengthened relative to the euro because a euro will buy fewer dollars. Now the U.S. investor would have lost due to the currency fluctuation because previously his or her European bonds or stocks would have been worth \$142,330, while six months later (again assuming all other factors remain the same), they are worth only \$130,000. This loss illustrates the exchange rate risk. Of course, no one objects to an exchange rate gain. It can be seen then that weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies is advantageous for U.S. investors in assets denominated in these foreign currencies, while strengthening of the U.S. dollar is disadvantageous to such U.S. investors.

**Political Risk** This risk arises out of uncertainty concerning possible unfavorable changes in the government, cultural, and business climates of a country. It can arise from hostile diplomatic or military actions, possibility of or actual expropriation of business assets, restrictive trade policies, unfavorable changes in tax policy, limits on foreign investment, limitations on currency exchanges, and manipulation of exchange rates, among other things.

**Tax Risk** This is the risk posed by possible unfavorable changes in the tax laws. Tax rates and the tax system obviously have an important bearing on investment decision making. The tax environment for wealth management and some upcoming future issues have been discussed in Chapter 2.

Unsystematic (or diversifiable) risk includes various types, as the following sections explain.

**Financial (or Credit) Risk** This unsystematic risk arises because the issuers of investments may run into financial difficulties and not be able to live up to their promises or expectations. For example, an investor who buys a corporate bond runs the financial risk that the issuing corporation will default on the interest payments and/or the principal amount at maturity. The buyer of common stock runs the financial risk that the corporation will reduce or eliminate its dividend payments or go bankrupt so that its stock becomes worthless.

Financial (credit) risk varies considerably among different classes of investments and over time. U.S. government securities generally are considered default-free and hence have no financial risk. Thus, their interest rates are lower than otherwise comparable securities. Investment-grade municipal

#### **Basic Investment Planning and Strategies 105**

securities are probably next lowest in financial risk because the states and municipalities issuing them have the taxing power. However, some municipalities have defaulted on their debt. Investment-grade corporate bonds generally have relatively low financial risk, but below-investment-grade corporate bonds ("junk bonds") have varying degrees of high financial risk. The financial risk of common stocks depends on the financial strength of the issuing corporation, but as an investment class, common stocks are the equity portion of a corporation's capital structure and, hence, are paid last in the event of a corporate default or bankruptcy (e.g., after bonds and preferred stock). For example, as of this writing, the common stockholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been virtually wiped out because of the federal takeover of those institutions.

Financial risk also varies considerably with economic conditions. The likelihood of defaults, reduced or eliminated dividends, and bankruptcies is much greater during recessions and depressions than during prosperity.

Financial risk can be diversified by an asset allocation strategy that balances more risky assets (such as common stocks, real estate, and hedge funds) with more secure assets (such as U.S. Treasury securities, municipal securities, and high-grade corporate bonds). Diversification can also be secured by investing in a number of different issues so that a default in any one issue will cause only limited harm to the portfolio.

**Business Risk** This unsystematic risk involves the nature of the industry in which a firm operates and the management and operations of the firm itself. Some industries are more stable than others, and the firms in those industries tend to have more dependable sales and profits. Consumer products companies, food companies, and utilities may be examples of this. On the other hand, other industries, by their nature, are more volatile and the sales and profits of firms in those industries tend to fluctuate widely. Industrial equipment and farm equipment manufacturers and property and liability insurance companies may illustrate this group.

Stable industries normally suffer less volatility during the business cycle than less stable industries.

Within any industry, there are well-managed firms and firms that are not so well managed. A firm's quality of management, business model, products and services, financial strength, and competitive position within its industry are critical to its financial success and hence its quality as an investment. The extent to which firms are deficient in their characteristics presents a business risk for investors.

Like financial risk, business risk can be diversified by a balanced asset allocation strategy and by spreading the risk among a number of different

issues so there is not undue concentration in one industry or in one or a few common stocks. Careful security analysis (with attention paid to quality of management) also can help reduce business risk.

**Liquidity and Marketability Risks** Sometimes, the terms *marketability* and *liquidity* are used to mean almost the same thing, but they do have different meanings. *Marketability* means the ability of an investor to find a ready market should he or she want to sell an investment in a short time. *Liquidity* means an investment is not only marketable, but also highly stable in price. In other words, an asset is liquid when an investor feels reasonably sure he or she can dispose of it quickly and also can receive approximately the amount put into it. Investors normally desire to keep some percentage of their overall portfolio in liquid assets (also called *cash equivalents*).

Marketability and liquidity risks represent the uncertainty that assets may not be marketable or may not be liquid when it is desired to convert them into cash. Securities listed on organized exchanges normally are marketable, but closely held corporate stock (such as in a family controlled corporation) generally has little marketability. That is why the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will allow discounts for lack of marketability in valuing closely held stock for tax purposes. Real estate generally is not very marketable since sales must be individually negotiated and normally take time to consummate. Other alternative investments, such as interests in hedge funds and private equity funds, also generally restrict marketability since hedge funds often have a one-year lockup period for initial investments and may otherwise restrict redemptions, while private equity may be more restrictive on marketability by not allowing redemptions during the first few years of investment, not paying investment returns for some time, and having a commitment period during which the fund may call for more capital from investors. There also may not be secondary markets for such investments. The IRS also may permit lack of marketability discounts for gifts of such interests.

Liquid assets include asset classes such as insured bank savings accounts and money market accounts, high-quality mutual fund money market accounts, insured traditional CDs, Treasury bills, short-term Treasury notes and high-quality corporate bonds, nonvariable life insurance cash values (through policy loans), and other similar stable-value assets.

The marketability risk can be diversified by balancing marketable and nonmarketable asset classes in a portfolio. Thus, portfolios that are heavily concentrated in relatively nonmarketable assets, such as real estate or closely held business interests, may find it difficult to raise cash quickly from such assets if necessary. As noted, liquidity risk can be reduced (diversified) by maintaining a percentage of a portfolio in liquid assets (cash equivalents).

**Investment Manager Risk** This risk arises from possible variations in performance by persons or institutions retained directly or indirectly to manage an investor's assets. As explained in Chapter 1, investment management can come from many sources.

Investment management often produces good results and sometimes produces superior results, but in some cases, the results may be mediocre or even poor, particularly during difficult economic times. And in any event, investment manager performance must be judged in relation to its cost. Also, investment manager performance should be evaluated over a reasonably long time (such as 5 to 10 years), not just over 1 or 2 good years.

Investment manager risk would appear to apply mainly to an active management investment strategy. Such a strategy involves periodic buying and selling of securities in an attempt to secure above-average returns for a portfolio or fund. An active management strategy involves either *market timing* (forecasting bull and bear markets for stocks and bonds and buying when low and selling when high) and/or *security selection* (analyzing the fundamental aspects of individual securities in attempting to select undervalued securities in the market or securities with above-average growth potential). Active management necessarily depends on the skill of investment managers to produce better-than-average results (net of their costs), and hence, implies the existence of investment manager risk.

*Passive investing*, on the other hand, involves holding a well-diversified portfolio of securities without making many, if any, active trading decisions and generally without trying to "beat the market." Passive investing is perhaps best illustrated by *indexing* (buying a fund or funds whose investments mirror a broad market index). Thus, since passive investing involves modest, if any, security selection, it implies little investment manager risk.

#### **Measures of Investment Returns (Rates of Return)**

The primary purpose of investing is to earn a return on one's capital. Investors normally want to maximize their *total after-tax returns* (investment income and capital gains combined) consistent with the level of risk they wish to assume. As we have seen in this chapter, the goal of modern portfolio theory is to attain the highest return for a given level of risk considering the correlations of the assets in a portfolio.

**Annual Rates of Return from Income (Yield)** There are several ways of measuring annual rates of return represented by the periodic income from an investment. They include *nominal yield, current yield, yield to maturity*, and *yield to call*.

Nominal Yield: This is the annual amount of interest or dividends paid compared with a security's par, or face, value, shown as follows:

Nominal yield =  $\frac{\text{annual interest or dividends}}{\text{investment's par or face value}}$ 

The nominal yield is called the *coupon rate* when applied to bonds and the *dividend rate* when applied to preferred stocks with a par value. For example, a bond with a maturity value (face amount) of \$1,000 that pays interest of \$70 per year has a nominal yield (coupon rate) of 7 percent. Nominal yield really has no meaning for common stocks and other forms of investment.

*Current Yield:* The current yield is the annual amount of income received from an investment compared with its current market price or value. It normally is used for common and preferred stocks and frequently for bonds as well. It can be calculated as:

$$Current yield = \frac{annual\ investment\ income}{investment's\ current\ price\ or\ value}$$

As examples of current yield, a common stock selling at \$50 per share with an annual dividend rate of \$1 has a current yield of 2 percent, and a 5 percent bond (coupon rate) that is selling for \$800 has a current yield of about 6.25 percent.<sup>12</sup>

Yield to Maturity: Another measure of yield commonly applied to bonds is the yield to maturity. Bonds have a definite maturity date when their par or face amount is to be paid by the issuer. However, investors can purchase bonds in the market for less than their maturity value (at a discount) or for more than their maturity value (at a premium). Thus, the concept of yield to maturity for a bond can be illustrated by taking the bond's annual interest income and either adding the annual gain (discount) or deducting the annual loss (premium) that will be realized if the bond is held to maturity. The result is divided by the average investment in the bond. Just to illustrate the principle involved, the following formulas show the approximate yields to maturity for bonds selling at a discount and at a premium.

For a bond selling at a discount:

$$\text{Yield to maturity} = \frac{\text{annual coupon interest} + (\text{discount} \div \text{number of years to maturity})}{(\text{current market price of bond} + \text{par value}) \div 2}$$

<sup>12</sup> Annual bond interest of \$50 (\$1,000 maturity value × 5%) divided by \$800 equals 0.0625, or 6.25%.

#### **Basic Investment Planning and Strategies**

For a bond selling at a premium:

$$\text{Yield to maturity} = \frac{\text{annual coupon interest} - (\text{premium} \div \text{ number of years to maturity})}{(\text{current market price of bond} + \text{par value}) \div 2}$$

An accurate yield to maturity is really the internal rate of return (IRR), as described in Chapter 3, for the bond's cash flows until maturity. It is the compound rate of return until maturity, assuming bond interest payments are reinvested in the bond at an interest rate equal to the yield to maturity being calculated. This accurate yield-to-maturity calculation can be done on a financial calculator.

For bonds selling at a discount, the yield to maturity is greater than the current yield, which, in turn, is greater than the coupon rate. For bonds selling at a premium, the opposite is true. When a bond is selling at or near par, the coupon rate, current yield, and yield to maturity will be essentially the same. In most cases, when an investor plans to hold a bond until maturity, the yield to maturity is considered the most accurate measure of annual investment return.

Yield to Call: For callable bonds, this is the same concept as yield to maturity, except it is assumed that the bond will be called (redeemed) under the bond's call provisions prior to maturity. Therefore, the IRR calculation uses the earliest call date (sometimes called "yield to first") and the value at call (including any "call premium") in the calculation. Of course, bonds will mature, but if they are callable, they may or may not actually be called, based on prevailing market interest rates.

Real versus Nominal Returns: The distinction between real (inflationadjusted) and nominal returns and values was discussed in Chapter 2. As explained, the real return on an investment is the stated periodic return (e.g., current yield) or nominal return minus the current or anticipated rate of inflation

While we normally think of real returns during inflationary economic periods (when real returns are less than nominal returns), the same principle applies during deflationary periods, but in the opposite direction. That is, the real return would be the nominal return plus the current or anticipated rate of deflation

**Capital Gains and Total Rates of Return** People often invest for capital gains as well as regular annual income. Capital gains generally result from the appreciation in the value of assets. Of course, there can be capital losses, too.

*Advantages of Taking Returns as Capital Gains:* Capital gains present a number of tax and nontax advantages for the investor, as follows:

- N Capital gains are not taxed until actually realized and recognized for tax purposes, such as by a sale or exchange of a capital asset. Therefore, an investor generally can determine when, if ever, the gain is to be taxed.
- N If an investor does not sell and realize a gain, but instead holds appreciated property until his or her death, the estate or heirs will get a stepped-up income tax basis in the property equal to its value for estate tax purposes (generally the value at the date of death), and the appreciation prior to death will forever escape taxation.13
- N If an investor needs current income from investments (or cash for other purposes), he or she can periodically sell (at capital gains tax rates) a portion of his or her appreciated property to produce the same result as a stream of interest or dividend income. The investor in this situation can select the best investment assets to sell for both investment and tax considerations.
- N The income tax rates are lower on long-term capital gains than on ordinary income. The top tax rate on long-term capital gains currently is 15 percent, while the top rate on ordinary income now is 35 percent.
- N Numerous planning techniques are aimed at avoiding capital gains taxation entirely, deferring taxation, or stretching out any gain over a period of years. These techniques are discussed in Chapter 11.

*Limitations on Taking Returns as Capital Gains:* On the other hand, capital gains as a form of investment return can have disadvantages.

- N Capital gains are inherently uncertain. There is no assurance an investment will appreciate. Thus, capital gains involve a higher degree of investment risk (in terms of variability of outcomes) than other forms of investment returns, such as interest and dividends.
- N Once a person has achieved unrealized capital gains and holds highly appreciated assets in his or her portfolio, a dilemma may result. The person may hesitate to sell for fear of capital gains taxation. This may be referred to as the *capital gains lock-in problem,* which is further discussed in Chapter 11.
- N It can be argued that investing for capital gains places greater emphasis on investment skill, since these returns are less certain.

*Measuring Total Returns and Holding Period Returns (HPRs):* Rates of return from capital gains are difficult to measure. First, no one can know

13The federal income tax system, including how capital gains are taxed, is described more fully in Chapter 10.

#### **Basic Investment Planning and Strategies 111**

what, if any, future capital gain there may be on a given investment. An investor really can only reason from experience with the particular investment or similar investments, and possibly from estimates of expected returns based on historical studies. Second, there is no assurance that past results will be repeated in the future. Finally, most investors suffer some capital losses as well as realize capital gains, and this will be affected by current economic conditions (e.g., the stage of the business cycle). Despite these problems, however, it is important to measure capital gains returns because they constitute an important part of total returns from some important asset classes, such as common stocks and real estate.

An investment's *total return* for a given year is the change in its price or value (up or down) in that year plus any cash flow (dividends, interest, or rents) for the year. For example, if a common stock's price is \$40 per share at the beginning of the year and \$44 at the end of the year, and if the stock paid \$1.20 in dividends during the year, its total return for the year is \$5.20 per share, or 13 percent (10 percent capital gain plus 3 percent dividend income) on the initial share price. This same approach can be used for calculating total returns on other assets, such as bonds.

An investment's HPR is its rate of total return over a given period (called the holding period). There may be annual HPRs or HPRs for longer periods.

*Geometric Average versus Arithmetic Average Returns:* When measuring investment returns for an asset or asset class over time, it often is desirable to determine the *average annual total return* over the given period. This would be the average holding period return for that period. This average return can be calculated as a geometric average or as an arithmetic average.

The *geometric average* (or average annual compound rate of total return) is the annual rate at which an initial investment will accumulate to equal the final value of the investment at the end of the period considered, assuming reinvestment of the cash flows received during the period. To calculate this annual rate, one needs the initial value of the asset or assets, any annual cash flows (e.g., dividends, rents, etc.) during the period, and the final value of the asset or assets at the end of the period. The geometric average can be determined by solving for *i* (INT) in an internal rate of return calculation on a financial calculator.

The so-called rule of 72 is sometimes noted as a way of estimating this average annual rate of return. This is done by dividing 72 by the number of years it takes for an investment to double in value. Or, using the same concept, one can estimate how long it will take for an investment to double in value by dividing 72 by the investment's expected rate of return. Or, to triple in value, divide 116 by the expected return.

The *arithmetic average* is just the average value of a series of annual total returns (or the sum of the total returns divided by the number of years). This does not involve the compounding of returns, and unless the annual total returns are the same, the geometric average will be less than the arithmetic average.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that 10 years ago Henry Potter started an investment portfolio with \$100,000 (after taxes) that he received as a bonus from his employer. He invested it in a diversified portfolio of good quality ("blue-chip") common stocks. The following table shows the value of Henry's portfolio at the beginning of each year and the total return (dividends plus capital appreciation, or minus capital depreciation) on the portfolio for each year. All dividends and realized capital gains were reinvested in the portfolio, and any income taxes on this investment were paid from other sources (i.e., they did not reduce the value of the portfolio). Henry would like to know what the average annual total return was on his portfolio for these 10 years.

|      | Value of Portfolio at | Percentage Total Rate of   |
|------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Year | Beginning of the Year | Return for the Year        |
| 1    | \$100,000             | 10%                        |
| 2    | 110,000               | 20                         |
| 3    | 132,000               | 5                          |
| 4    | 138,600               | 8                          |
| 5    | 149,688               | 12                         |
| 6    | 167,650               | 6                          |
| 7    | 177,710               | 4                          |
| 8    | 170,602               | 10                         |
| 9    | 153,542               | 9                          |
| 10   | 167,361               | 20                         |
| 11   | 200,833               | —                          |
|      |                       | 76 (total rates of return) |

The geometric average annual total return on Henry's portfolio for this period was 7.22 percent. This was determined from an IRR calculation on a financial calculator. According to the rule of 72, the rate of return would be approximately 7.2 percent (72 ÷ 10 years) since the portfolio approximately doubled in 10 years. To apply this rule, one must already know when the investment will double or the expected rate of return. The arithmetic average annual total return on the portfolio was 7.60 percent. This is the sum of the annual total returns of 76 percent divided by 10 years.

**After-Tax Yields** Up to this point, we have not considered the effect of income taxes on investment returns. As a practical matter, however, investors want to know what their investment returns are after taxes.

For purposes of estimating after-tax yields, we shall view the returns from investments as income that is taxable currently as ordinary income, income that is entirely tax-exempt, and returns that are taxable when realized (and recognized), if ever, as capital gains or as qualified dividend income. The taxation of returns in and distributions from various tax-deferred (advantaged) plans are discussed in Part V.

*Taxable Ordinary Income:* Investment income that is fully taxable as ordinary income, such as interest on CDs, taxable money market funds or accounts, corporate bonds, and U.S. Treasury bonds, is easy to express on an after-tax basis. The *after-tax yield* can be determined by multiplying the current yield by 1 minus the investor's highest marginal income tax rate. Thus, if a married taxpayer's highest tax bracket is 28 percent, a CD paying 4 percent interest would provide the following after-tax yield:

$$\begin{aligned} \text{After-tax yield} &= \text{current yield } (1 - \text{tax rate}) \\ &= 0.04 \ (1 - 0.28) \\ &= 0.04 \ (0.72) \\ &= 0.0288 \ \text{or} \ 2.88\% \end{aligned}$$

*Tax-Exempt Income and Taxable Equivalent Yields:* The after-tax yield for a fully tax-exempt investment equals the current yield. Thus, the after-tax yield for a 4.5 percent current yield municipal bond is 4.5 percent.

It is common practice also to express what a fully taxable security would have to earn to equal the yield from a tax-free security at different income tax rates. For example, a 4.5 percent tax-free yield received by an investor in a 35 percent tax bracket is worth 6.92 percent to him or her on a fully taxable basis.14

*Capital Gains Returns and Total Returns:* It becomes more complicated to determine after-tax yields when investment returns are in the form of

<sup>14</sup>Any similar tax-equivalent yields can be calculated by dividing the tax-free yield by 1 minus the investor's highest marginal income tax rate. In this case, 4.5% ÷ (1 – 0.35 or 0.65) 6.92%. The highest marginal income tax rate used also can include state and local top marginal income tax rates if the income from the security also is exempt from those taxes as well as from the federal income tax.

capital gains or losses; or quite likely are part ordinary income, part taxexempt income, part qualified corporate dividends, and part long-term capital gains or losses for an investment portfolio as a whole.

**Tax Impact of Capital Gains** Net short-term capital gains (net gains realized and recognized on capital assets held for 12 months or less) are taxed at the same rates as ordinary income. Therefore, they present no special tax advantage.

Net long-term capital gains (technically, these are *net capital gains*, as defined in Chapter 10) are net gains realized and recognized15 on capital assets held for more than 12 months. As of this writing, they generally are taxed at a top rate of 15 percent through 2010, after which the top rate becomes 20 percent. However, the actual impact of income taxes on capital gains depends on whether a gain is ever realized and recognized for tax purposes, how long an asset has been held before the gain is realized and recognized, the applicable capital gains tax rate, and other factors. Thus, after-tax total returns depend on the circumstances.

A logical question at this point is how capital gains can completely escape income taxation. The answer lies in provisions of the tax code that allow taxpayers or their estates and heirs to avoid potential capital gains taxation entirely and other provisions that permit assets to be disposed of or arranged without current capital gains taxation and perhaps ultimately with no capital gains taxation at all. These planning techniques are described in Chapters 10 and 11.

**Combination of Circumstances** For most investors, the situation regarding taxation of their investment portfolio will be a mixed bag. In terms of capital gains and losses, some assets will be bought and sold in a fairly short time; others will be bought and held for the long term and then sold; while still others will be bought and held until death, or capital gains will be avoided in some other fashion. Furthermore, some assets will yield ordinary income; others will yield tax-exempt income; while still others will have special tax advantages, such as real estate and other alternative investments.

**Planning Considerations Regarding Investment Returns** From this discussion, some general planning issues emerge:

N It generally is better to take investment returns as long-term capital gains than as ordinary income.

<sup>15</sup>The terms *realized* and *recognized* are technical but important in tax terminology. A gain is realized when there is an actual sale or exchange of a capital asset at a gain. The gain also is recognized for tax purposes, unless there is a specific nonrecognition provision in the tax code that delays recognition of the gain. The taxation of capital gains and losses is treated more fully in Chapter 10.

- N It generally is better taxwise to allow capital gains to accumulate over time before taking them. But this is always subject to the investment merits of holding the security.
- N When consistent with other goals, it is desirable to avoid capital gains taxation entirely.
- N An analysis should be made of the relative attractiveness of tax-free investment income (e.g., interest on most municipal bonds) as compared with taxable investment income for the particular investor. This depends on the investor's marginal income tax rates (federal, state, and local), the current yield (or yield to maturity) on tax-free bonds, and the total after-tax yield on comparable investments.

Of course, these general planning considerations should always be taken within the context of the investor's overall objectives, investment strategies, and general financial constraints.

**Yields on Mutual Funds** The principles just discussed also generally apply to assets held in mutual funds. However, there are some special tax rules applying to mutual funds, which are explained in Chapter 8.

**Assets Held in Tax-Advantaged Plans** Some of the principles just described also apply to assets held in income tax–deferred plans, such as qualified retirement plans, IRAs, Roth IRAs, and investment annuities. However, different tax rules apply to these plans, which will affect their after-tax returns. These plans and the tax rules applying to them are discussed in later chapters.

**Risk-Adjusted Returns and Performance Measures** The previous discussion of rates of return in investments did not take investment risk (volatility) into consideration. A number of theoretical models and formulas have been developed to help adjust and evaluate investment returns in relation to the risk involved.

*Equity Risk Premium (Excess Return):* This preliminary concept shows the return in an individual investment or portfolio that exceeds what could have been earned in risk-free assets. Thus, the equity risk premium (excess return) on an investment portfolio is the portfolio's total return minus the risk-free rate (typically the yield on short-term Treasury bills). It is the extra return an investor receives for taking an investment risk. For example, if the total return on a portfolio in a given year is 8 percent and the risk-free rate is 2 percent, the equity risk premium would be 6 percent.

*Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):* This theoretical model is designed to measure the expected return on an individual security or investment portfolio considering the security's or portfolio's investment risk as measured by its beta. The formula for CAPM, which for this purpose is also known as the *security market line (SML)*, is as follows:

$$ER = r + \beta (RM - r)$$

where

ER the stock's or portfolio's expected return *r* the risk-free rate B the stock's or portfolio's beta

RM the stock market return;

therefore,

RM – *r* the equity risk premium for the market or the market premium

The SML is an upward-sloping graph of various combinations of the riskfree asset and the particular security or portfolio, with the expected return on the vertical axis and the beta on the horizontal axis. Thus, it shows that increasing expected returns correspond to increasing investment risk (security or portfolio beta).

As an example of the CAPM, if the risk-free rate is 2 percent, the rate of total return for the entire stock market is 7 percent, and a given portfolio of stocks has a weighted average beta of 1.25 relative to the market (i.e., it is more volatile than the market), the portfolio's expected return (ER) would be:

$$ER = 2 + 1.25 (7 - 2) = 8.25$$
 percent

The actual returns from the portfolio then can be compared with the expected returns from the CAPM. In the preceding example, if the portfolio's actual return is greater than 8.25 percent, it has exceeded expectations and the investment management has been good, but if the actual return is less than 8.25 percent, the portfolio has not met expectations.

The concept of the CAPM is theoretical in nature and may or may not be correlated to actual investment experience. There is some controversy on this point.

*Alpha (Jensen Ratio):* This number shows how a security or portfolio (e.g., a mutual fund) performed, given its level of risk as shown by its beta, as compared with the stock market (or a benchmark index) as a whole. The formula for a stock's or portfolio's alpha is as follows:

$$A = R - [r + \beta (RM - r)]$$

where

*A* the stock's or portfolio's alpha *R* the stock's or portfolio's actual return *r* the risk-free rate B the stock's or portfolio's beta RM the stock market return;

therefore,

RM – *r* the equity risk premium for the market or the market premium

For example, assume a stock mutual fund had an actual return of 9 percent, has a beta of 0.70 (i.e., it is less volatile than the benchmark index), the risk-free rate is 3 percent, and the stock market return (based on the benchmark index) is 10 percent. In this example, the portfolio's alpha would be:

$$A = 9 - [3 + .7 (10 - 3)] = 1.1\%$$

A positive alpha, as in this example, means the fund performed better than the market (the expected return) when its return is adjusted for the risk taken as measured by its beta. A negative alpha means the reverse. Therefore, alphas are often cited as risk-adjusted performance measures relative to the expected return in judging investment managers.

*Sharpe Ratio:* This measure divides a portfolio's excess return by its standard deviation as a measure of risk.

*Treynor Ratio:* This measure is similar to the Sharpe ratio, except that it divides excess return by the portfolio's beta. The Sharpe and Treynor ratios are useful when comparing one investment or portfolio with others. Taken by themselves, these ratios do not measure a portfolio's risk-adjusted return relative to the market's (or benchmark's) return.

*Appropriate Benchmarks:* Benchmarks are typically indexes of securities prices, assuming dividends and interest are reinvested. An index is a statistical measure showing the change over time of its component items relative to a base date, which has an index value of 100. We have already noted price indexes (like the consumer price index) in Chapter 2.

Securities indexes track values of groups of stocks or bonds over time. They may include large numbers of securities (like the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index) or be limited to a more narrow market segment (like the Wilshire Real Estate Securities or CS First Boston High Yield Bond indexes). Indexes are widely reported and are used by investors and the public to track day-to-day movements and long-term trends in securities prices. They also provide the basis for many indexed securities and insurance products, such as index mutual funds, most exchange-traded funds (ETFs), equity indexed annuities and life insurance policies, among others. These products are discussed in Chapters 17 and 21.

In the context of performance measures, benchmarkers serve as a point of comparison for the returns or risk-adjusted returns from securities or portfolios (like mutual funds). They can represent the "market" in the various performance concepts and measures just discussed. In this role as a standard of comparison, it is important that the index be similar or comparable to the portfolio that is being compared to it. In analyzing the performance and risk level of mutual funds, for example, the alpha, beta, and R2 of the fund may be compared to a "standard index" (such as the S&P 500) and a "best fit index" (such as the Russell 1000), depending on the investment objective of the fund.

Some commonly used indexes (among others) include the following:

- N Wilshire 5000
- N Standard & Poor's 500
- N Standard & Poor's Mid-Cap 400
- N Standard & Poor's Small-Cap 600
- N Russell 2000
- N MSCI EAFE
- N MSCI Emerging Markets Free Global
- N CS First Boston High Yield Bond

An *index* is different from an average. As just noted, an index charts percentage change from a base line. An *average*, like the widely quoted Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), is the arithmetic mean of the prices of the securities included in the average at a given time.

*Time-Weighted versus Dollar-Weighted Returns: Time-weighted returns* represent the average annual compound rate of return on a fixed dollar fund (such as \$100,000) for a given period (such as 10 years). It does not consider any additional investments or withdrawals from the fund during that time. This is the geometric mean over that time. Mutual funds report such returns over various periods.

*Dollar-weighted returns* take into consideration that amounts may be added to or subtracted from an investment fund during the period involved. This probably is the more likely scenario for most investors. In situations like 401(k) plans or periodic investing under dollar-cost averaging, periodic contributions are routinely made to the investment fund. In this case, the return is the IRR on the cash flows going into and out of the investment fund.

*Other Asset Pricing and Option Models:* The CAPM, which is a cornerstone of much modern theoretical thinking in finance, was discussed earlier in this chapter. Another asset-pricing model is the *arbitrage pricing theory (APT)*. In addition, there is the well-known *Black-Scholes option valuation*  *model*, which is discussed in Chapter 18 in connection with employee stock options. There also is a *binomial option pricing model*.

## **Diversification**

The basic purpose of diversification is to reduce or minimize an investor's risk of loss (variability of overall returns and values). It is primarily a defensive policy and is discussed in detail in Chapter 9.

## **Tax Status**

An investment's tax status can have an important bearing on its attractiveness. This is discussed more fully in subsequent chapters of this part.

## **Size of Investment Units (or Denominations)**

In some cases, an investment can be made only in certain minimum amounts. For example, municipal bonds frequently are sold in lots of \$5,000 or more. Direct investments in real estate require a down payment and payment of closing costs, as well as adequate mortgage financing. Also, hedge funds and private equity require large minimum investments.

## **Use as Collateral for Loans**

Many forms of property can be used as collateral for loans. However, some kinds serve better than others. For example, good-quality securities (other than municipal bonds), life insurance policies, and improved real estate may operate well in this regard. In contrast, some types of property are unattractive. For example, tax-free municipal bonds involve tax pitfalls when used as collateral, or even when they are owned and other property is used as collateral for loans, as discussed in Chapter 7.

## **Callability**

As discussed earlier in the section "Reinvestment Risk," callability (or redeemability) can be an important factor when investing in bonds and preferred stocks. Many issuers of corporate and municipal bonds have reserved the right to call or redeem the bonds before maturity, usually subject to certain conditions. Most issues of preferred stock also are callable. On the other hand, most U.S. government securities and some municipal and corporate bonds are not callable prior to maturity.
