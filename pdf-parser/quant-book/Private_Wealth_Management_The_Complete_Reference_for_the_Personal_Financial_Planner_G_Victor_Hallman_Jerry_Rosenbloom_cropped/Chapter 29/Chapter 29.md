# **Taxation of Life Insurance**

The tax advantages of life insurance were first mentioned in Chapter 21. In this chapter, we shall consider these advantages in more detail.

#### **Federal Income Taxation**

**Death Benefits** The face amount of a life or accident insurance policy paid by reason of the insured's death normally is not gross income to the beneficiary. When life insurance death proceeds are held by the insurance company under a settlement option, the proceeds themselves remain income tax–free, but any interest earnings on the proceeds will be taxable income. Correspondingly, when life insurance death proceeds are paid to a trust, the proceeds themselves are income tax–free, but the trust investment income from them will be taxed under the normal rules for trust taxation.

**Benefits Paid for Terminally Ill Insureds** As explained in Chapter 23, life insurance contracts often provide for accelerated death benefits to terminally ill insureds. Also, viatical companies have purchased insurance policies from such insureds, as well as from others. The tax law provides that accelerated death benefits and amounts received from viatical settlement providers for a "terminally ill individual"1 may be excluded from gross income. The nature and limits of this exclusion are explained in Chapter 23.

**Transfer-for-Value Rule** An important exception to the general principle that life insurance death proceeds are income tax–free is the transfer-forvalue rule. This tax rule provides that if a life insurance policy is transferred for a valuable consideration (sold), at the insured's death the beneficiary must include in gross income the difference between the death proceeds and the consideration paid for the policy plus any subsequent premiums paid by the transferee (buyer).

Suppose, for example, that a viatical company buys a \$500,000 (face amount) life insurance policy from a terminally ill owner-insured for \$400,000 and pays an additional \$10,000 in premiums. Eighteen months later, the insured dies. The \$400,000 received from the viatical settlement provider is not gross income to the owner–insured. However, the viatical company (the purchaser and beneficiary of the policy) has gross income of \$90,000 (\$500,000 death proceeds – \$410,000 [\$400,000 consideration paid plus \$10,000 in subsequent premiums]).

There are, however, some important exceptions to the transfer-forvalue rule. First, when the transferee (buyer) is the insured, a partner of the insured, a partnership in which the insured is a member, or a corporation in which the insured is a shareholder or officer, the transfer-for-value rule does not apply. This removes from the rule many common transactions. The

<sup>1</sup>The law also may allow death benefits and other benefits paid to a "chronically ill individual" to be excluded from gross income, but only for amounts paid under a part of the policy that is treated as a qualified long-term care contract.

other exception is when the basis in the policy in the hands of the transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis in the policy in the hands of the transferor (seller).

**Premiums Paid** Premiums for personally owned life or accident insurance or an employee's contribution to group life or accident insurance (other than under cafeteria plans) are not deductible for income tax purposes.

**Inside Buildup of Cash Values** Annual increases in the cash value of a life insurance policy (fixed-dollar or variable) are not currently taxable to the policyowner. This is the tax-deferred (or, hopefully, tax-free) buildup of life insurance cash values.

**Policy Dividends** Life insurance policy dividends do not constitute taxable income to a policyowner until they exceed the policyowner's income tax basis in the policy. Furthermore, when policy dividends are used to buy paidup additional amounts of life insurance (paid-up additions), there is also a tax-free buildup of the cash value of these additions.

**Surrender or Maturity of Policies** If a life insurance contract is surrendered, is sold (other than for terminally ill insureds), or matures during the insured's lifetime, the policyowner will have ordinary income to the extent the amount received exceeds the policyowner's investment in the contract (income tax basis in the policy). This investment in the contract normally is the sum of the net premiums paid (gross premiums minus dividends received in cash). Life insurance policies normally allow the policyowner to leave the surrender value with the insurance company under one or more settlement options. In this case, the entire gain still will be taxed as ordinary income, but it will be spread out over a period of time, depending on the nature of the settlement option (see Chapter 21).

**Partial Withdrawals** For some policies (e.g., UL and VUL), policyowners can make *partial cash withdrawals.* In the case of policies that are not MECs, the general rule is that such cash distributions are not taxed until they exceed the policyowner's basis in the contract (a FIFO-type rule). However, if such cash distributions are received as a result of certain changes in the contract that reduce benefits and occur during the first 15 years of the contract, different rules apply, and such distributions may be taxable in whole or in part.2

For example, suppose that Henry Libowitz has a \$750,000 face-amount (type A death benefit) VUL policy on his life that he purchased 20 years ago. The policy permits partial withdrawals. Henry has paid \$100,000 in

<sup>2</sup>This is sometimes referred to as the *forced-out gain,* or FOG, provision.

premiums during this period (his investment in the contract or basis), and the policy cash value (invested in a common stock subaccount) is \$225,000. Henry can withdraw up to his \$100,000 basis without receiving any taxable income, but his basis (and possibly the face of the policy) will be reduced by any such withdrawals. If Henry withdraws more than his \$100,000 basis, amounts over basis are taxed as ordinary income to him.

**Policy Loans** For policies that are not MECs, policy loans are not viewed as distributions from the policy for income tax purposes and, hence, are not gross income even if they exceed the policyowner's basis in the contract. For example, in the situation of Henry Libowitz just described, if Henry took a \$200,000 policy loan from his VUL policy, it would not result in any gross income to him.

**Changes in Asset Allocations within Variable Policies** Changes in cash values among subaccounts in variable life insurance are not currently taxable sales or exchanges for capital gains (or loss) purposes.

**Planning for Taking Cash (Benefits) from Life Insurance Policies** Policyowners normally do not want to surrender policies for cash before the insured's death, because if the cash value exceeds basis, the owner will realize ordinary income on the difference. Also, he or she will no longer have the insurance protection. There often are other options. First, a policyowner can just continue the policy in force until the insured dies, at which time the death proceeds will be received income tax–free. The policyowner can continue paying premiums or just enough premiums (with the existing cash value) to keep the policy in force for its full amount. A vanishing-premium approach also may do this.

Second, a policyowner can decide to stop paying premiums and take a reduced paid-up amount of life insurance without any current income taxation. If the policy is participating, the policyowner may allow policy dividends to continue to accumulate and, for example, be used to purchase paidup additions (without current tax liability), or the policyowner could take the policy dividends in cash and pay income tax on the dividends only when they cumulatively exceed the policyowner's basis in the policy. Correspondingly, a policyowner of a flexible premium contract normally can elect to reduce the amount of insurance (if necessary) to where the existing cash value can be expected to carry the policy without further premium payments. In either case, the death benefit will be income tax–free at the insured's death.

Third, if a policyowner under a flexible-premium contract wants to take cash from the policy (which will reduce the cash value and may reduce death proceeds), he or she can take tax-free partial withdrawals up to the investment in the contract. Then, the remaining cash value may carry the policy

#### **Life Insurance in Estate Planning 675**

(with perhaps some additional premiums as needed) until the insured's death, when the proceeds will be received income tax–free.

Finally, cash can be taken tax free from a life insurance policy by way of policy loans. If the policy is to be continued in force, additional premiums normally will have to be paid. Also, a policy loan will require nondeductible interest and may be subject to direct recognition for policy dividend purposes. At the insured's death, the proceeds, minus any outstanding policy loans, will be paid income tax–free to the beneficiary.

**Reasons for Taking Cash from Life Insurance Policies** A policyowner may need cash for children's educations, business opportunities, or other purposes, but still want to maintain the life insurance, or most of it, in force for family protection or estate conservation purposes. Or a policyowner may need cash for retirement income purposes. Of course, he or she could surrender the policy and perhaps take the cash surrender value over a period of years in installments or perhaps as a life income. On the other hand, the policyowner may want to take cash from the policy (or stop premium payments) at retirement without losing the life insurance protection and hopefully without income taxation. In this event, one of the other strategies just noted may be appropriate.

Finally, a policyowner may want to take cash from a policy prior to transferring it as a gift to an ILIT or an individual donee. This will lower or even eliminate any gift tax value in the policy. It also will enable the policyowner to benefit from at least some of the cash-value buildup in the policy.

**Taxation of Economic Benefit of Life Insurance in Some Situations** Under some circumstances, the economic value of life insurance protection is gross income to the insured.

*Group Term Life Insurance:* The first \$50,000 of group term life insurance does not result in gross income to insured employees or to retired former employees whose insurance is continued into their retirement years. For amounts in excess of \$50,000, the cost of group term life insurance on an employee's (or retiree's) life, minus any employee (or retiree) contributions, is gross income to the employee (or retiree).3 The cost (economic benefit) of group term life insurance for this purpose is calculated by using uniform premiums (Table I rates) promulgated under IRS regulations, or the actual cost of the insurance, if lower. As we shall see later in the discussion of gifts of group term life insurance, these Table I rates (or actual cost, if lower) also are used to value gifted group term life insurance.

<sup>3</sup>The income tax treatment of employees and retirees under group term life insurance plans is governed by Section 79 of the IRC. Thus, group term life plans sometimes are called *Section 79 plans.*

*Split-Dollar Life Insurance Plans:* These arrangements are described later in this chapter. At this point, however, it may be noted that a split-dollar arrangement between an employer and employee may produce annual gross income to the insured employee.

*Life Insurance Included in Qualified Retirement Plans:* Sometimes, life insurance is purchased by qualified retirement plans on the lives of plan participants. Here again, the life insurance will produce annual gross income to the insured employee, as described later in this chapter.

#### **Federal Estate Taxation**

**Inclusion in Gross Estate** Life insurance death proceeds will be included in the insured's gross estate if the insured's estate is named as beneficiary, or if another named beneficiary (such as a trust) is required to or actually does provide the proceeds to meet the estate's obligations, or if the insured at the time of death owned any incidents of ownership (i.e., ownership rights) in the policy. Incidents of ownership include such rights as the power to change the beneficiary, the right to surrender or cancel the contract, the right to assign the contract, and the power to borrow against the policy. Other powers may also be incidents of ownership. However, paying premiums and receiving dividends under participating policies are not considered incidents of ownership.

**Gifts of Life Insurance within Three Years of Death** If life insurance policies are given away within three years of the insured's death, the proceeds generally will automatically be included in the insured's gross estate. But if the policy is given away more than three years before the insured's death, the proceeds cannot be included in the gross estate.

In situations where the insured makes cash gifts to third parties or an ILIT, which they then use to purchase and own a newly issued life insurance policy on the insured's life, the courts have held that the proceeds are not in the insured's gross estate, even if the insured should die within three years of the gifts. Thus, for newly issued policies that are to be owned by, say, an ILIT, the proper strategy would seem to be to create the ILIT; make a cash gift to the trustee; and then let the trustee purchase, own, and be the beneficiary of life insurance on the grantor's life. Then the three-year automatic inclusion rule would not apply. Of course, an existing policy owned by the insured would have to be transferred to a third party or an ILIT to remove the proceeds from the gross estate, and so the three-year rule cannot be escaped.

**Corporate-Owned Life Insurance (COLI)** In general, when life insurance is owned by a corporation of which the insured is a stockholder, the proceeds are not included in the insured's gross estate at death because the insured has no direct incidents of ownership in the policy. However, under IRS regulations, if the insured was the sole or a controlling stockholder (owning stock with more than 50 percent of the combined voting power over the corporation), the incidents of ownership in the insurance held by the corporation will be attributed to the sole or controlling stockholder and the proceeds included in his or her gross estate, but only to the extent that the proceeds are not payable to the corporation or for a valid business purpose of the corporation.

Thus, for example, if a trust for the benefit of a sole or controlling stockholder's family is named as beneficiary of the COLI, the death proceeds (to that extent) will be included in the stockholder's gross estate. But if the corporation is named as beneficiary, they will not. However, when the corporation is named as beneficiary (such as for key person life insurance, for example), the death proceeds will be considered in valuing its stock in the deceased stockholder–insured's gross estate. On the other hand, the estate may be entitled to a discount in valuing the stock because of the loss to the corporation of the stockholder–insured's services. This might be called a *key person discount.*

**Life Insurance on the Lives of Others** Suppose one person owns life insurance on the life of another and the policyowner (not the insured) dies. In this case, the value of the policy (not the death proceeds) will be included in the deceased policyowner's gross estate.

#### **Valuation of Life Insurance Policies for Tax Purposes**

The general rules for valuing property for gift and estate tax purposes also apply to life insurance contracts. However, some special principles are relevant because of the nature of life insurance. A newly issued policy (with periodic premiums or a single premium) normally is valued at the actual premium paid. A paid-up policy that has been in force for some time is valued at its replacement cost (the single premium as of the valuation date for the same policy). For cash-value policies that have been in force for some time and on which additional premiums are payable, the value normally is the policy's interpolated terminal reserve plus the pro rata unearned premium (plus any dividend accumulations and minus any policy loans). This value is essentially the policy's cash value, but is not exactly the same. For previously issued individual term policies, the value will be the unearned premium for the year as of the valuation date. As noted previously, the continuing value of group term life insurance is the Table I rate times the full amount of insurance gifted.

## **Federal Gift Taxation**

**Taxable Transfers in General** If a policyowner absolutely assigns a life insurance policy to someone else, he or she has made a current gift of the then value of the policy. If the donor (normally the insured) continues to pay premiums on the policy, each premium constitutes an additional gift to the new owner. Correspondingly, for gifts of group term life insurance, the annual value of the economic benefit would be a continuing gift each year to the donee. When policies are owned by an ILIT (either purchased directly by the trustee or absolutely assigned to the trustee by the insured), the grantor may make periodic gifts to the trust so that the trustee can pay the premiums.

**Possible Indirect Gifts by Third-Party Individual Owners** An unusual gift situation can arise when a life insurance policy on the life of one person is owned by a third person and the beneficiary is yet another person. In this situation, upon the insured's death, the owner of the policy is considered to have made a taxable gift of the full policy proceeds to the beneficiary. This can be referred to as an *inadvertent gift* because the policyowner usually has no idea that he or she is making such a taxable gift. Therefore, when the owner of a life insurance policy is other than the insured, the owner should name himself or herself as beneficiary.

## **Federal GST Tax**

Life insurance may be subject to the GST tax. In most cases, this will result from having life insurance in an ILIT that itself is a generation-skipping or dynasty trust. Hence, GST tax planning may be necessary.

# **How to Arrange Life Insurance**

When life insurance is purchased for family protection purposes, the insured may name his or her spouse as primary beneficiary and their children or a trust as contingent beneficiaries. This may be fine in many cases, but various other possibilities may be considered. A basic issue is whether the insured will be owner of the insurance and thus have the proceeds included in his or her gross estate at death, or whether another person or an ILIT will own the insurance and thus have the proceeds escape federal estate taxation at the insured's death. When the insured's estate is large enough to attract federal estate taxation, it is increasingly common to have another person other than the insured's spouse, or more commonly an ILIT, own the life insurance.

#### **Policy Owned by the Insured**

Policies owned by the insured can be made payable in the following ways.

**To the Insured's Estate** This usually is not done unless the insured wants to make sure the proceeds will be available to his or her executor for estate settlement purposes.

**To a Third-Party Beneficiary or Beneficiaries in a Lump Sum** This is a common arrangement, frequently with the insured's spouse as primary beneficiary and children (or a trust) as contingent or secondary beneficiaries. Upon the insured's death, however, this arrangement may leave the beneficiary with a sizeable sum of money to manage, perhaps at the very time he or she is least able to manage it.

**To a Third-Party Beneficiary or Beneficiaries Under Policy Settlement Options** The settlement options generally included in life insurance policies were described in Chapter 21. Most insurance companies give the insured wide latitude in the settlement arrangements he or she can make for beneficiaries, or for himself or herself for policy surrender values. Beneficiaries also usually can elect settlement arrangements for themselves after the insured's death if the insured has not already done so.

**To a Revocable Unfunded Life Insurance Trust** The basic decision a policyowner–insured often must make is, "Should life insurance proceeds be left with the insurance company under a settlement arrangement or with a bank or other trustee to be administered under a trust agreement?" There are arguments on both sides, but the trend decidedly has been toward the use of revocable insurance trusts.

**To a Testamentary Trust** Sometimes life insurance proceeds are payable to the trustee of a trust set up under the insured's will.

#### **Policy Owned by a Person Other Than the Insured**

Ownership can be placed in a third party at the inception of the policy or after it has been issued. Placing ownership in another can be effected by an ownership clause in the policy at inception or by an absolute assignment of the policy. When an ownership clause is used, successive owner(s) can be designated in the event the first owner dies prior to the insured.

Policies may be owned outright by various members of the insured's family, such as adult children. However, there may be drawbacks in this. For example, assuming the insured dies before the policyowner, the proceeds will be paid to the policyowner as beneficiary and will be included in the policyowner's gross estate upon his or her subsequent death, unless he or she makes lifetime gifts or consumes them. In other words, generation skipping (except possibly for one skip person donee) is not possible. On the other hand, the insured may only be interested in keeping the proceeds out of his or her gross estate and the gross estate of his or her spouse, if married.

Another issue is what happens if the individual policyowner (donee) predeceases the insured. Generally, the policyowner's will should leave the policy to someone else who would be a logical owner or to an ILIT, or policy ownership might pass to a successive owner under an ownership clause in the policy.

Still another possible drawback is that policy proceeds paid to an individual in a lump sum may be subject to claims of the individual's creditors or possibly to marital claims against the individual. Furthermore, when ownership is placed in an individual, the policy is subject to that person's control.

Finally, there generally is no tax advantage in giving life insurance to the insured's spouse. Because of the unlimited marital deduction, the same tax result can be achieved simply by naming the spouse as beneficiary. For example, suppose Harry Branson is married, has a sizeable estate, and owns a \$700,000 life insurance contract on his own life. If he absolutely assigns this policy to his wife, Mary, and survives three years, it will be out of his gross estate at death, but the \$700,000 proceeds will be paid to Mary as beneficiary and will be in her gross estate at her subsequent death. On the other hand, if Harry keeps ownership of the policy and just names Mary as revocable beneficiary, the \$700,000 proceeds will be in his gross estate at death, but since they are payable to his surviving spouse, they qualify for the marital deduction and so are deductible in full from his gross estate to arrive at his taxable estate. However, since they are paid to Mary as beneficiary, they will be in her gross estate at her subsequent death. Thus, either way, the \$700,000 proceeds will not be taxable at Harry's death, but will be at Mary's subsequent death, absent remarriage, gifts, or consumption of its proceeds. Thus, the normal approach is to make gifts of life insurance to another person or, more commonly, to an ILIT. That way, the proceeds can escape federal estate taxation in both the insured's estate and his or her spouse's estate.

#### **Policy Owned by an ILIT**

**General Considerations** In this case, the insurance policies are owned by and payable to the trustee of an *inter vivos* irrevocable life insurance trust (an ILIT). Upon the insured's death, the proceeds are paid to the trustee and are administered according to the terms of the trust, usually for the benefit of the insured's family. The trust owns and administers the policy(ies) during the insured's lifetime, but it is otherwise unfunded in that usually only a small amount of other assets are also placed in the trust. Payment of premiums may be handled by the insured's making periodic gifts to the trustee, who then uses the funds to pay the premiums.

**Transfer Tax Advantages** Both the insured's gross estate and the insured's spouse's gross estate normally are skipped in these arrangements. If desired, other trust beneficiaries' estates also can be skipped, provided the beneficiaries (and the insured's spouse, if he or she is also a trust beneficiary) are given only those powers that will not cause the corpus to be included in their gross estates.

However, when a trust is arranged to skip the gross estates of, say, children and other descendents of the grantor, it will be a generation-skipping trust and so may be subject to the GST tax. In this event, the grantor may want to allocate part of his or her exemption to each gift he or she makes to the trust to keep the trust entirely exempt from GST tax. This provides a substantial leveraging effect for the GST tax exemption, since it is allocated only to each periodic gift to the trust to pay premiums, while the entire policy proceeds (as trust corpus) are exempted from the GST tax.

**Gift Tax Annual Exclusion** A potential problem for ILITs is that any gift of a policy, and any subsequent gifts by the insured, may not be gifts of a present interest and, hence, not eligible for the annual exclusion.

*Crummey Powers–General Considerations:* However, if a trust gives the beneficiary(ies) a noncumulative annual right to withdraw for a limited period that year's contribution to the trust (a Crummey power), the annual exclusion can be secured for the contribution up to stated limits. The annual limit on Crummey withdrawal powers for each trust beneficiary normally is the lesser of the beneficiary's pro rata share of that year's contribution to the trust or a stated limit.

*Setting Annual Limits:* A planning issue is how to state this limit. It could be set at the available annual exclusion or twice that amount if split gifts are planned. However, as explained in Chapter 27, a Crummey power is a general power of appointment, and when not exercised, it would be a lapse of a general power. The IRC provides that a lapse of a general power of appointment is only considered a release of the power to the extent it exceeds the larger of \$5,000 or 5 percent of the total property value from which the power could have been exercised.4 This so-called 5 and 5 power often is

<sup>4</sup>This is the same provision that underlies the "5 and 5 power" discussed previously.

#### **682 Part VIII. Estate Planning**

referred to as the *lapse-protected amount*. Thus, lapses of a general power in excess of this amount will be a release of the power. The release of a general power may give rise to a taxable transfer for gift-tax purposes from the donee of a power (e.g., a trust beneficiary with a Crummey power) to the other trust beneficiaries and may result in the inclusion of at least a portion of the trust corpus in the gross estate of the donee (the trust beneficiary), depending on the terms of the trust. Therefore, when the annual stated limit is set at, say, the currently available annual exclusion or twice that amount, it exceeds the \$5,000 or 5 percent lapse-protected amount.5 The excess may be a taxable gift by the Crummey powerholder, and there may be inclusion in his or her gross estate. The taxable gift issue normally can be avoided by giving each powerholder a separate share of the trust and a testamentary power of appointment (normally a special power) over his or her share. This makes gifts by the powerholder incomplete. The estate tax issue remains. However, as a practical matter, this may not be a problem if the corpus of the ILIT will be distributed to the powerholder anyway (and hence be in his or her gross estate at some point). Of course, as explained in Chapter 27, the limit could just be set at the \$5,000 or 5 percent lapse-protected amount and then there would be no issue, but this would be less than the available annual exclusion.

*Generation-Skipping Transfers:* If the ILIT is to be a generation-skipping trust, inclusion of a portion of the corpus in a powerholder's gross estate normally would frustrate the generation-skipping purpose of the trust. In this case (and possibly other cases), planners may limit the Crummey withdrawal power to the smaller of the annual exclusion or the lapse-protected amount. In this event, depending on the amount of gifts made to the ILIT, some of the grantor's gift-tax applicable credit amount may have to be used. Also, some of the grantor's GST tax lifetime exemption would be allocated to the gifts to the trust to make it entirely exempt for GST tax purposes.

*Hanging Crummey Powers:* Another approach suggested by some planners is the "hanging Crummey power." This is a withdrawal right up to the full applicable annual exclusion that will lapse if not exercised within a specified period, but only to the extent of the lapse-protected amount for that year. Thus, to the extent the withdrawal right exceeds the lapse-protected

<sup>5</sup>Note that this \$5,000 or 5 percent (whichever is larger) lapse-protected amount applies *per trust beneficiary* each year and not per gift or per trust. Therefore, if a person is, say, beneficiary of several trusts with Crummey powers, he or she is entitled to only one 5 and 5 lapseprotected amount per year, and gifts to the trusts should be coordinated to reflect this.

amount, it will continue to be exercisable (i.e., it will "hang") into the future until it can lapse in some later year within the lapse-protected amount for that year.

*Provisions of Crummey Powers:* The power to withdraw generally should be available to beneficiaries for a reasonable period (such as 30 days), and the beneficiaries should have actual notice of their Crummey withdrawal rights and probably of contributions to the trust. Also, the persons having Crummey powers should be trust beneficiaries.

There normally should be enough value in an ILIT to satisfy the Crummey withdrawal power if it should be exercised by the powerholder. This depends on the type(s) of insurance contracts in the trust and their values. Sometimes planners consider it advisable to have separate liquid assets in the trust sufficient to cover one year's gifts to the trust so that a Crummey withdrawal could be satisfied if necessary.

*Cautions Concerning Crummey Powers:* Since 1981, the IRS has not been willing to issue private letter rulings with respect to certain life insurance trusts containing Crummey powers. Furthermore, in recent years, the IRS has increased its scrutiny of and concern over Crummey powers in general. Therefore, planners should be on their guard with respect to Crummey powers and plan for them carefully.

**Providing Liquidity and Estate Balance Through ILITs** Since there will be a large amount of life insurance proceeds paid to the trustee upon the insured– grantor's death, the ILIT can be an excellent source for providing liquidity to the grantor's estate, the grantor's spouse's estate, or possibly for other purposes. However, care must be taken in how this liquidity is provided. The trustee should not be required to pay or, if authorized to do so, should not actually pay directly the estate taxes and other death costs that are obligations of the insured's estate. This is because these situations will cause the life insurance proceeds to be in the insured's gross estate and the whole purpose of the ILIT will be lost.

Instead, the trustee should be authorized (but not required) to make loans to the deceased insured's estate (or revocable trust) or to buy assets from the estate (or revocable trust) to provide liquidity. This authority also can be extended to the insured's spouse's estate, which may bear the brunt of estate taxes, and possibly to business interests of the insured, which may need cash at his or her death.

An ILIT can also be used to balance an estate among heirs. For example, suppose John Able, who is divorced, owns 100 percent of the stock of a corporation that he would like to leave under his will to his son, who is active with him in the business. The corporation is worth \$2 million, and John has about \$2,500,000 of other assets. However, John has two other children who are not interested in the business, and he wants to be fair with them. To provide balance among his children, John could establish an ILIT with about \$2 million of insurance on his life and with his two other children as trust beneficiaries. He then could leave his corporation stock to his son in the business. His other assets might be used to pay death taxes and other costs and then divided among his children so as to equalize their inheritances.

**Life Insurance in the Estate Plan** With the increasing excluded amounts and possible repeal of the federal estate tax, questions have arisen in the past about the role of life insurance for estate liquidity and conservation purposes. Life insurance is important for these purposes. The time of death is uncertain and life insurance is the most logical financial product for providing estate liquidity and estate conservation at that time. Also, life insurance is an income tax–favored product it can be removed from the gross estates of both, the insured and his or her spouse through ILITs, and all of its traditional functions in family and business planning remain. Finally, when the internal rate of return (IRR) on insurance death benefits (assuming death at the end of life expectancy) for many policies is considered. Life insurance is an attractive investment in any event. Earlier death, of course, provided an even greater return.

#### **Other Policy Arrangements**

**Split-Dollar Plans** These are arrangements under which benefits and often premiums for cash-value policies are divided between two parties. When the parties are an employer and an insured employee, it may be referred to as *employer-provided split-dollar.* When the parties are other than employer and employee (e.g., a split-dollar arrangement between a parent and a child or between an ILIT established by the insured and the insured's spouse), it is referred to as *private split-dollar.* The remainder of this discussion will be based on employer-provided split-dollar unless the contrary is indicated.

*Basic Characteristics:* The employer may pay that part of each annual premium equal to the increase in the policy's cash value for that year, the annual premium minus a contribution from the insured employee, or the whole annual premium, depending on the nature of the plan. The employee, or an ILIT established by the employee to own the employee's interest in the policy, pays the part of the annual premium, if any, not paid by the employer. There may be other variations in the split of premiums under these plans.

If the insured dies while the plan is in effect, the employer receives a portion of the death proceeds equal to the policy's cash value or the premiums it has paid (depending on the terms of the plan), and the employee's personal beneficiary or an ILIT receives the balance of the proceeds. If the arrangement is terminated other than by the insured–employee's death, the employer would be entitled to the policy's cash value or the premiums it has paid (again depending on the terms of the plan).

*Policy Ownership:* The ownership of split-dollar life insurance can be structured in several ways. Under the *endorsement plan,* the employer owns the policy and the division of proceeds and premiums is provided for in an endorsement to the contract. Under the *collateral assignment plan,* the employee owns the policy and the employer's interest is protected by a collateral assignment of the life insurance. An insured employee's interest in a split-dollar arrangement to be transferred to an ILIT or entered into initially between the employer and the ILIT. This is done to remove the proceeds from the insured's gross estate. In these arrangements, the insured employee is considered to make annual indirect gifts to the ILIT of the plan's value each year to the employee.

*Income Tax Status:* This depends on when the split-dollar arrangement was created. Unless IRS arrangements (arrangements entered into after September 17, 2003, or entered into previously, but materially modified after September 17, 2003), are taxed under a loan system (generally for collateral assignments-type plans) or under an economic benefit system (generally for endorsement-type plans).

Under the *loan system*, the nonowner (e.g., the employer) is treated as making loans (the premium payments) to the owner (e.g., the employee) which would be taxed under the below-market loan rules (see Chapter 3). Under the *economic benefit system*, the owner (e.g., the employer) is considered to be providing an economic benefit (the value of the life insurance provided) to the nonowner (e.g., the employee). In either case, there is income taxation (or other taxation) arising from the split-dollar plan. For split-dollar arrangements entered into before September 18, 2003, the previous (more taxable) IRS rules and guidance apply.

**Life Insurance Owned by Business Entities** Individual life insurance policies may be purchased and owned by business entities on the lives of one or more of their owners or employees. The entities normally are the beneficiaries of the insurance. In the case of corporations, this often is referred to as corporate-owned life insurance (COLI).

Insurance purchased and owned in this manner can have a variety of purposes, such as key-person life insurance, life insurance to fund buy–sell agreements, life insurance to informally fund nonqualified deferred-compensation agreements, and life insurance to finance Section 303 stock redemptions. The business entities do not get an income tax deduction for the premiums paid on such insurance, but the death proceeds are received income tax–free. The other tax advantages of life insurance also apply.

**Life Insurance in Qualified Retirement Plans** While qualified retirement plans are primarily for retirement purposes, life insurance can be part of, or carried in, such plans. When this is the case, employee–participants must include the value of the current life insurance protection in their gross income each year. This currently taxable term cost is determined by applying one-year term rates (the lower of the IRS's P.S. 58 rates or the insurer's initial-issue yearly renewable term rates on standard lives) as of the insured's attained age to the difference between the face value of the policy and the policy's cash value as of the end of the year. Policy cash values are plan assets and are taxable as ordinary income when distributed from the plan. The pure protection element, however, is received by the beneficiary income tax–free as life insurance death proceeds. Whether life insurance should be provided under qualified retirement plans is a somewhat controversial issue that is beyond the scope of this book.

# **Gifts of Life Insurance**

Many persons with estates sufficiently large to attract federal estate taxation have made gifts of their life insurance policies as an integral part of their estate planning.

#### **Advantages of Gifts of Life Insurance**

Life insurance generally is attractive gift property since it normally can be removed from the insured's gross estate by giving away all incidents of ownership in the policy. Furthermore, insureds can continue to pay the premiums or make periodic gifts to ILITs to enable the trustee to pay them. Also, the gift tax value of insurance contracts, the premium payments, and any indirect gifts normally are small, and in any event are relatively much less than the amount removed from the taxable estate (the policy face). In fact, with the use of Crummey powers and annual exclusions, there may be no actual gift tax involved. Furthermore, an insured may want to make an ILIT into a generation-skipping trust by allocating part of his or her GST tax lifetime exemption to gifts made to the trust. Finally, people may be more willing to give away life insurance (particularly term or low cash-value policies) than, say, securities, because life insurance usually is not producing income currently and is normally intended for the benefit of the policy beneficiaries anyway.

#### **Pitfalls in Gifts of Life Insurance**

Despite these advantages, there are some issues to consider. First, the unlimited marital deduction has eliminated any estate tax advantage that may have existed in giving life insurance to one's spouse. Second, donors should be careful to divest themselves of all their interests and rights in the policy. Finally, a life insurance policy normally is valuable property. Therefore, insureds should consider carefully whether they want to relinquish ownership and control over their policies, particularly if the policy has a sizeable cash value.

#### **Gifts of Group Life Insurance**

Changes in state law and group contracts have made it possible in most cases for employees to absolutely assign their group term life insurance to an ILIT or another person and remove the proceeds from their gross estate. This can be attractive because the face amounts of group term life insurance in some cases can be quite substantial. Also, since it is term insurance, employees really are not giving away much in the way of policy values. However, there will be annual indirect gifts, as described previously.

#### **What Policies to Give?**

Most kinds of life insurance can be placed in, or purchased by, an ILIT. However, lower premium and lower (or no) cash-value forms may be desirable to minimize gift tax issues. This means group term life insurance, an individual term policies, universal life and variable universal life policies with low (or withdrawn) cash values, and low cash-value whole life insurance often are attractive policies to give away. Another popular kind of policy to place in ILITs is a second-to-die policy covering a husband and wife. Also, it is possible to reduce the cash value of an existing policy by the policyowner taking a policy loan and then gifting the encumbered policy to the ILIT or other donee. However, in this case, it is important that the policy loan not exceed the policyowner's income tax basis in the policy for the reason explained in the next section. Finally, it is possible to withdraw each value up to basis in a UL or VUL policy prior to the gift.

#### **Gifts of Policies Subject to Loans**

A policy loan reduces the gift tax value of a policy by the amount of the loan and provides assets for the donor's own use. However, loans will reduce the ultimate death benefit. Also, funds need to be provided to pay interest on loans, or additional loans must be taken to pay the interest (although there is a limit to this or the policy will lapse). In addition, there is a *transfer-for-value issue* when policies are given away subject to loans. This is viewed as a sale of the policy to the donee for the amount of the loan, and it is a transfer for value. However, an exception to the transfer-for-value rule is when the basis of the policy in the hands of the transferee (donee in this case) is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor (donor). This is referred to as the *carryover basis exception.*

If a policy loan on a gifted policy is less than its basis (net premiums paid) in the hands of the donor, the carryover basis exception applies because it is viewed as part sale and part gift, and thus the donee's basis is determined in part (the gift part) by reference to the donor's basis. As an example, assume the following facts about a gifted policy:

| Face amount                             | \$500,000 |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|
| Policy value before policy loan         | \$80,000  |
| Policyowner's (donor's) basis in policy | \$70,000  |
| Policy loan                             | \$65,000  |

In this case, the policy value for gift tax purposes is \$15,000 (\$80,000 – \$65,000). The donee's basis is determined in part by the presumed sale (the \$65,000 loan) and in part by the carryover gift basis of the donor (\$15,000). Hence, the carryover basis exception applies and the transfer is not subject to the transfer-for-value rule. The donor also realizes no gain because the presumed sale proceeds (the \$65,000 loan) are less than the donor's basis in the policy (\$70,000).

On the other hand, if we change our assumptions so that the loan is more than the policy's basis in the hands of the donor, there is a different and less happy result.

| Face amount                             | \$500,000 |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|
| Policy value before loan                | \$80,000  |
| Policyowner's (donor's) basis in policy | \$70,000  |
| Policy loan                             | \$75,000  |

In this case, the policy value for gift tax purposes is only \$5,000 (\$80,000 – \$75,000). However, now the donee's basis is determined by the presumed sale (the \$75,000 loan) and there is no carryover gift basis from the donor. Hence, the carryover basis exception does not apply and, unless some other exception applies, the transfer is subject to the transfer-for-value rule. This will subject the proceeds at the insured's death (minus the donee's basis in the policy) to taxation as ordinary income. In addition, the donor realizes a \$5,000 gain on the policy transfer (taxed as ordinary income) since the presumed sale proceeds (the \$75,000 loan) exceed the donor's basis in the policy (\$70,000).

This is a complex issue, and it can be a tax trap for the unwary. The principle involved is that when giving away a life insurance policy subject to indebtedness, be sure the outstanding loan is less than the donor's income tax basis in the policy. In some cases, part of a loan may have to be repaid to achieve this result.
