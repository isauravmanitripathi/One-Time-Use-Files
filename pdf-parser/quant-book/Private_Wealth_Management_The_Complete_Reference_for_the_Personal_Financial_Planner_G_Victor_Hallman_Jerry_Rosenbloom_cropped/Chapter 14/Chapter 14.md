- N The nature, tax status, and planning for nonqualified deferred compensation
- N The types of nontaxable fringe benefits and tax status of other benefits

# **Other Employer-Provided Retirement Plans Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) Plans**

**Basic Characteristics** Employers can establish SEPs for their employees utilizing individual retirement accounts or annuities1 that are owned by the individual employees and that effectively may accept a rate of contribution from the employer up to the lesser of 25 percent of each participant's compensation or \$49,000 in 2009 (indexed for inflation in \$1,000 increments). Self-employed persons also can establish SEPs for themselves and their employees, if any. Employer's contributions are deductible by the employer and not currently taxable to employees. For self-employed persons, contributions on their behalf are deductible by the self-employed person on his or her tax return in the same manner as contributions to HR-10 plans.

SEPs are intended to reduce the paperwork and regulations required for HR-10 and qualified corporate retirement plans and, as a result, be easier for employers and self-employed persons to adopt. Like profit-sharing plans,

<sup>1</sup> IRAs are described in detail in Chapter 15.

SEPs allow for discretionary contributions by employers. These streamlined plans tend to appeal mainly to smaller employers, although there is no employer size limit in the law.2

Technically, SEPs are not classified as qualified retirement plans. Rather, they are defined as regular (traditional) IRAs that meet the requirements of the tax law to be a SEP. SEP contributions cannot be made to a Roth IRA.

**Participation Requirements** For an IRA to be a SEP, the employer must contribute for each employee who has performed services for the employer during the year, attained age 21, performed services for the employer in at least three of the immediately preceding five calendar years, and received at least \$550 as of 2009 (indexed for inflation) in compensation from the employer for that year. All such eligible employees must be covered by the SEP.

**Nondiscrimination Requirements** An employer's contributions to a SEP may not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees or selfemployed persons. In general, this means contributions must bear a uniform relationship to the total compensation of each employee maintaining a SEP. The top-heavy rules also apply. SEPs may be integrated with Social Security.

**Nonforfeitable Contributions (Immediate Vesting)** SEPs must provide immediate and 100 percent vesting of employer contributions. In addition, employees must be permitted to withdraw amounts in their SEP-IRA accounts at any time. The individual employees own and control their own IRAs.

**Distributions** In general, as with traditional IRAs, distributions are taxed to the employee as ordinary income. In addition, premature distributions are subject to the 10 percent penalty tax, and a participant must begin receiving distributions by the required beginning date and according to the minimum distribution rules, as described in Chapter 16. Finally, loans by employees are not permitted from SEPs.

# **Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE Plans)**

Another approach to encouraging smaller employers and self-employed persons to adopt retirement plans for themselves and their employees is the SIMPLE plan concept, which was adopted in 1997. This concept actually refers to two separate kinds of plans: SIMPLE-IRA plans and SIMPLE 401(k) plans.

**SIMPLE-IRA Plans** These plans allow eligible employees and self-employed persons to elect to receive compensation or earned income in cash or to

<sup>2</sup>Prior to 1997, employers with 25 or fewer employees could establish salary-reduction SEPs called SAR-SEPs. However, the law has been changed and no new SAR-SEPs could be established after 1996.

contribute to a SIMPLE-IRA under a qualified salary-reduction agreement. The employer must make either certain matching contributions or nonelective contributions for all eligible employees, regardless of whether they elect to contribute. An employer's contributions are deductible by the employer and not currently taxable to employees. For self-employed persons, contributions on their behalf are deductible on their own tax returns.

These plans are regular (traditional) IRAs that meet the requirements of the tax law to be SIMPLE-IRAs. Each participant owns his or her own SIMPLE-IRA.

*Eligible Employers:* An employer eligible to establish a SIMPLE-IRA plan is one that employs no more than 100 employees earning at least \$5,000 from the employer during the preceding year.

*Contribution Requirements:* Eligible employees (and self-employed persons) must be allowed to make an elective (salary reduction) contribution, which may be expressed as a percentage of compensation or a fixed dollar amount. These elective contributions may not exceed \$11,500 in 2009 (indexed for inflation). Also, participants age 50 and over can make additional annual catch-up contributions of up to \$2,500 in 2009 (indexed for inflation).

Employers are required to make either matching contributions or nonelective contributions. Employer-matching contributions are required to match employee elective contributions dollar for dollar, generally up to an amount not exceeding 3 percent of the employee's compensation. Employer-matching contributions also may not exceed the dollar limits on elective contributions just noted. Alternatively, employers can choose to make nonelective contributions of 2 percent of compensation per year on behalf of all eligible employees, whether or not they make elective contributions.

Unlike SEPs, an employer does not have discretion in deciding whether to contribute to a SIMPLE-IRA plan in a given year. Employee elective contributions are at the option of eligible employees, and the employer then must make either employer-matching contributions or employer nonelective contributions.

*Participation Requirements:* All employees (except for limited groups of excludable employees) who received at least \$5,000 in compensation from the employer during any two preceding years and who are reasonably expected to receive \$5,000 in compensation in the current year must be eligible to participate. However, unlike SEPs, no nondiscrimination or top-heavy rules apply to SIMPLE-IRAs.

*Nonforfeitable Contributions (Immediate Vesting):* Like SEPs, employer contributions to a SIMPLE-IRA must be immediately and 100 percent vested in the participants' SIMPLE-IRAs. Also, participants must be permitted to withdraw the amounts in their SIMPLE-IRAs at any time.

#### **360 Part V. Retirement Planning and Other Employee Benefits**

*Exclusive Plan Requirement:* A plan will not be treated as a SIMPLE-IRA plan in any year the employer also had a qualified retirement plan, tax-sheltered annuity plan, SEP, or governmental plan (other than a Section 457 plan) under which contributions were made or benefits were accrued. This is different from SEPs, where an employer may also have these other plans.

*Distributions:* As in the case of traditional IRAs, in general, distributions from an employee's SIMPLE-IRA are taxed to the employee as ordinary income. Also, premature distributions are subject to the normal 10 percent penalty tax and loans are not permitted from the plan. However, for SIMPLE-IRAs, premature distributions within the first two years of an employee's participation in the plan carry a 25 percent premature distributions tax. After this two-year period, the penalty tax drops down to the normal 10 percent. The minimum distribution rules also apply.

*Rollovers:* For participants who have been in the plan for less than two years, rollovers and transfers can only be made from one SIMPLE-IRA to another SIMPLE-IRA. However, after an employee participates in the plan for two years or more, rollovers can be made from a SIMPLE-IRA to another SIMPLE plan, a qualified retirement plan, a tax-sheltered annuity (TSA), a traditional IRA, or a Section 457 plan.

**SIMPLE 401(k) Plans** This is a Section 401(k) plan for an eligible employer (defined the same way as for SIMPLE-IRAs) that is allowed to meet the ADP nondiscrimination test (see Chapter 13) by satisfying the requirements to be a SIMPLE 401(k) plan. These requirements include a contribution requirement, a nonforfeitable (immediate vesting) requirement, and an exclusive plan requirement, like those for SIMPLE-IRAs. However, SIMPLE 401(k) plans are subject to the other qualification and distribution requirements that apply to Section 401(k) plans generally.

# **Tax-Sheltered Annuity (TSA) Plans**

A TSA plan, or Section 403(b) annuity, is an arrangement whereby an employee of a qualified organization can enter into an agreement with his or her employer to have part of the employee's earnings set aside for retirement on a before-tax basis.

**Who Is Eligible?** Any employee who works for a public school system or a tax-exempt organization established and operating exclusively for charitable, religious, scientific, or educational purposes is eligible.

**How Much Can an Eligible Employee Contribute Each Year?** There are two ways of approaching contributions to a TSA plan: an additional contribution

by the employer (salary increase) for the employee or a salary reduction agreement (elective deferral) between the employee and his or her employer. Salary reduction is the most common approach. For salary reduction agreements, there is an annual elective deferral limit of \$16,500 (indexed for inflation). Further, the Section 415 limits for defined contributions plans, noted previously, also apply to Section 403(b) annuities. In addition, for participants age 50 and over, the annual limit on elective deferrals can be increased by catch-up contributions of \$5,500 for 2009.

**Taxation of Distributions** Benefits are taxed as ordinary income when received by a participant. However, tax-free transfers and rollovers are allowed between TSA plans and traditional IRAs, qualified plans, Section 457 plans, and other TSAs. TSA plans also are subject to the minimum distribution rules and the 10 percent excise tax on premature distributions. They must be nondiscriminatory.

## **Nonqualified Deferred Compensation**

A deferred-compensation arrangement is an agreement whereby an employer promises to pay an employee in the future for services rendered today. The plan usually is set up to provide for the payment of deferred amounts into an account for the employee, which may be paid out under specified conditions in the future. Plans also may be in the form of salary continuation over a period of years following retirement or other termination of employment. These plans are called *nonqualified* because they do not meet the tax law requirements for qualified retirement plans. They normally are available only to a selected group of executives.

**Why Nonqualified Deferred Compensation?** Some businesses do not have qualified retirement plans, and so they may provide nonqualified plans for selected employees. However, in many cases, employers do have qualified plans covering the bulk of their employees but want additional benefits for certain key people. This is particularly true because of the limits on benefits under qualified plans (e.g., the compensation cap, Section 415 limits, and so forth). Furthermore, executives often want to defer income to get the advantages of before-tax deferral.

**Types of Plans** Either the employer or the employee may initiate these plans. When requested by an employee, it sometimes is known as a *deferredoriented* or *savings-type* plan. In these plans, employees voluntarily agree that a portion of their income should be deferred. Many plans are of this type. On the other hand, plans initiated by an employer may be called *benefit-oriented* or *inducement-to-stay* plans.

Plans may also be classified as *deferral-type plans,* as just described, or as *supplemental plans,* which are provided and paid for by employers to supplement qualified retirement plans for highly paid employees. There also are *death-benefit-only plans,* which provide benefits, usually in the form of annual installments, to survivors of a deceased participant. Finally, there are *Section 457 nonqualified deferred-compensation plans* for employees of state and local governments and nonprofit organizations.

**Taxation of Nonqualified Deferred-Compensation Plans** Two doctrines or theories of tax law may particularly affect nonqualified plans. These are the *constructive receipt* doctrine and the *economic benefit* theory. Under the doctrine of constructive receipt, as explained in Chapter 10, a taxpayer may be taxed on income not actually received if it is considered received constructively. For example, say an employer deposits funds with a trustee and that an employee has a right to the funds and may withdraw them or receive benefits from them at any time without substantial limitation. In this case, the funds placed with the trustee will be considered constructively received by the employee—not when they are actually withdrawn, but when they are placed with the trustee. Under the economic benefit theory, a person may be taxed whenever a monetary value can be attached to compensation or benefits. To successfully defer income taxation, a nonqualified deferred-compensation plan must not come under either of these doctrines.

In analyzing the tax status of these plans, it makes a difference whether the plan is considered funded for tax purposes. A *funded* plan is one in which specific assets have been set aside and in which the employee is given a current beneficial interest in the assets. Plans without such assets securing the benefits are *unfunded.* If a plan is unfunded, income taxation on the benefits can be postponed until they are actually received by the employee or his or her beneficiary. Thus, if an employer merely promises to pay deferred amounts (and the accumulated before-tax investment income on such amounts) upon the occurrence of certain events (such as the passage of time, termination of employment, retirement, death, or disability), the plan normally is not hampered by the constructive receipt doctrine because the delay is a substantial limitation on the receipt of the benefits. Moreover, if the plan is not secured so as to be protected from the employer's creditors, most authorities feel the employee should not be considered to have received an economic benefit. Thus, an *unfunded deferred-compensation plan* normally can provide an employee with a postponed accumulated account balance, and the employee's rights to the account balance can be nonforfeitable, unconditional, and vested, with the income tax on the deferred compensation and investment earnings being deferred until actual receipt. The employee (or his or her beneficiaries) is taxed when the deferred benefits are actually received.

#### **Other Employer-Provided Retirement Plans and Employee Benefits 363**

Due to some perceived abuses regarding nonqualified deferred compensation and other plans, Section 409A was added to the tax code in 2004 by the American Jobs Creation Act. Section 409A provides for the inclusion in the gross income of certain participants in nonqualified deferred compensation plans of all amounts deferred under the plans when the plans fail to meet specified requirements of the provision. Such requirements deal with when distributions can be made from the plans, acceleration of benefits, employee elections for deferral, changes in the time and form of deferral, some rules regarding funding, and so forth. Thus, it is important for plans covered by Section 409A to comply with its terms to avoid immediate taxation on deferred amounts.

With a funded plan, in which an employee is given rights to specific assets, the employee will be taxed currently on the value of the assets added to the fund each year, unless the employee's rights to the benefits are subject to a *substantial risk of forfeiture.* This means there must be a risk that the employee will never receive the benefits. Most nonqualified plans are unfunded.

**Security Arrangements and Informal Funding for Nonqualified Plans** Employers sometimes have informal funding arrangements to provide themselves with assets to discharge their obligations under these plans. These arrangements (often involving the purchase of life insurance on the participating executives' lives) are owned by, controlled by, and made payable to the employer, and hence, do not provide any direct security to the executives covered by the agreements. The employer's commitments remain unsecured promises to pay, which covered executives can enforce only as general creditors of the employer. For tax purposes, such "informally funded plans" are still regarded as unfunded plans.

In recent years, there has been heightened interest in finding ways to provide greater security to executives with regard to unfunded nonqualified plans. One such security arrangement is the so-called rabbi trust.3 A rabbi trust is an irrevocable trust set up by an employer to provide various kinds of nonqualified retirement benefits to selected employees. The trust provides that its assets will be paid out to meet the employer's obligations under certain circumstances, but that the trust assets remain subject to the claims of the employer's general creditors in the event of the employer's bankruptcy or insolvency. This means that even though the employer places assets in these trusts, they do not result in current taxable income to the covered employees. Thus, rabbi trusts can provide at least limited security for covered executives without losing the income tax advantages of an unfunded plan. For funded

<sup>3</sup>These trusts are called *rabbi trusts* because the first case involving their use, upon which the IRS ruled, involved such a trust set up by a synagogue for its rabbi.

plans, some arrangements to secure benefits are employee-owned trusts (sometimes called *secular trusts*) and employee-owned annuities.

**Planning Issues for Nonqualified Deferred Compensation** These plans can be attractive for selected executives and corporate directors. The executives often do not need the current income and they may be in a lower tax bracket when the deferred benefits are paid out. Investment earnings on the deferred amounts also are tax deferred, and some employers provide attractive investment outlets for deferred amounts. On the other hand, the security issue is there for unfunded plans. Its importance would seem to vary with the circumstances and be more important during difficult economic times.

In a different area, nonqualified deferred compensation may be used in connection with the sale of closely held business interests. Part of the purchase price (for a closely held C corporation, for example) effectively might be in the form of a nonqualified deferred-compensation agreement with the selling owner–employee. The deferred payments would be tax deductible to the corporation (and indirectly to the buyer), and thus part of the purchase price would be in tax-deductible dollars. On the other hand, these payments would be taxable as ordinary income to the selling owner–employee. Such arrangements are complex and require advance planning.

## **Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans**

Supplemental nonqualified plans in the forms of ERISA excess benefit plans and supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs) are also established for executives. ERISA excess benefits plans pay the difference between the maximum permitted limits under qualified retirement plans (e.g., the Section 415 limits) and the employee's full benefit, as determined by a regular plan's benefit formula. In addition, SERPs may be set up to increase the level of retirement income for executives beyond that contemplated under the basic retirement plan benefit formula.

# **Other Employee Benefits Dependent Care Assistance**

This benefit typically provides day care for specified dependents of employees, including dependent children, parents, or spouses. The IRC provides that employees do not have to include in their gross income amounts not exceeding \$5,000 per year paid or incurred by their employer for dependent care assistance, if the assistance is provided under a program meeting certain requirements. Eligible expenses include the expense of a child or senior daycare center, a babysitter while the employee is working, a nursery school, a day camp, and a nurse at home. Such expenses are only eligible if they permit the employee or the employee and his or her spouse to work or to attend school full-time. These expenses frequently are also covered under flexible spending accounts (FSAs) on a pretax basis.

# **Educational Assistance**

The gross income of employees does not include amounts paid or incurred by an employer for educational assistance to employees under a program that meets certain requirements, up to a maximum of \$5,250 per employee per year.

# **Financial and Other Counseling Services**

Many companies provide financial planning services on an individual basis for their executives as an executive benefit. In some cases, employers may provide such financial planning services for a broader range of employees. Employers may also provide their employees with other types of counseling; one popular area is retirement planning and counseling.

# **Cafeteria Compensation (Flexible Benefits)**

**Basic Characteristics** The nature of these plans is described in Chapter 22 and so will not be repeated here.

**Tax Status of Cafeteria Plans** Section 125 of the IRC allows employees to choose among certain nontaxable benefits and taxable compensation without having the choice itself be a taxable event under the constructive receipt doctrine. Section 125 plans must be nondiscriminatory and meet certain other tax law requirements. In effect, this means the constructive receipt doctrine will not apply to otherwise nontaxable benefits elected by employees, even though they could have elected taxable benefits (cash) as well. Of course, to the extent employees actually elect cash compensation, it will constitute gross income to them.

# **Nontaxable Fringe Benefits**

Employers can provide employees with a variety of benefits and services, which the tax law specifically provides are not gross income to the employees.4 The term *fringe benefits* sometimes is used loosely to mean any kind of

<sup>4</sup> Section 132 of the IRC provides that "certain fringe benefits" are excluded from gross income. Prior to Section 132, there was uncertainty about the tax status of many of these items.

employee benefit other than retirement benefits. However, in the context of nontaxable fringe benefits under Section 132, it refers only to certain benefits specified in the law, as described next.

**Types of Nontaxable Fringes** The specific benefits include the following:

*No-Additional-Cost Services:* These are the same services employers sell to the general public that are provided free or at reduced cost to employees.

*Qualified Employee Discounts:* These generally are discounts up to 20 percent on the prices of goods and services.

*Working Condition Fringes:* These are a variety of expenses paid for by employers that otherwise would be deductible by employees as business expenses on their own tax returns. They may include items such as professional dues; subscriptions to business periodicals; cars, aircraft, and the like (for business purposes); club dues; outplacement assistance; and home computers.

*De Minimus Fringes:* In general, these are items that are so small and infrequently received that it is not practical for employers to account for them. However, it does include meals available at employer-provided eating facilities and certain employer-provided dependent group life insurance.

*Qualified Transportation Fringes:* These include employer-paid commuter highway vehicle transportation (e.g., a van pool with at least six passengers), transit passes, and qualified parking, up to limited amounts per month. These fringes also include any cash reimbursements by employers for such expenses, and allow employees a choice between these fringes and cash without constructive receipt if the nontaxable fringes are elected.

*Qualified Moving Expense Reimbursements:* These are employerreimbursed or paid moving expenses for an employee to relocate to a new place of work, provided they otherwise would have been deductible by the employee as moving expenses.

*On-Premises Athletic Facilities:* The use of on-premises athletic facilities is a nontaxable fringe benefit if substantially all the use of such facilities is by employees, their spouses, and their dependent children.

**Other Benefits** If an employer provides other benefits to employees, aside from these specified nontaxable fringe benefits and the previously discussed employee benefits excluded from income by other sections of the tax code, the value of the benefit normally will be taxable to employees as compensation.
