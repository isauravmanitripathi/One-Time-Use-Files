## **Need for Wealth Management Services**

Most people are in need of wealth management. They have various financial and personal goals they want to attain for themselves, their families, and perhaps for charitable entities and others. Of course, some persons and families have situations and objectives that are more complex than others. But virtually everyone has a need for planning to some degree.

To help meet their goals, the public is offered a sometimes-bewildering array of investment products, financing plans, insurance coverages, taxsaving ideas, retirement plans, trusts, charitable giving arrangements, and other products and ideas. However, these financial arrangements and ideas often are presented in a piecemeal fashion without overall coordination and planning. In contrast, the concept of private wealth management is the development and implementation of comprehensive plans for achieving a person's overall financial and personal objectives, as noted in this chapter and throughout this book.

## **Wealth Management over a Family's Economic Lifecycle**

People deal with their objectives over their entire *economic lifecycle*. This cycle encompasses their *early years as an income earner* when they often are purchasing a home, concerned with debt management, protecting a young family with adequate insurance, and hopefully beginning their wealth accumulation program. When they enter their higher-earning years, they should have significant capital accumulation, but at this *midlife period*, they also often are faced with financing their children's higher education, planning in earnest for their own retirements, and perhaps needing to provide financial support (including possible custodial care) for aged parents or other relatives. Then there are their *immediate preretirement and retirement years,* when they must organize their affairs so that they will have adequate retirement income during the lifetimes of both spouses. They also may want to arrange their retirement plan distributions so that they can meet both their retirement income needs and their wealth-transfer objectives in a tax-efficient manner. Depending on how old people are when they have their children and the ages of their parents, they also may be faced with higher education expenses and the cost of caring for aged parents at the very time they need to be primarily concerned with income for their own retirements. Finally, people normally plan for the *transmission of their wealth* during their lifetimes and/or after their deaths to their children, grandchildren, or other heirs, again in a taxefficient manner (estate planning).

This book covers planning strategies and techniques to meet the objectives just noted. While some of these techniques may apply primarily to higher-net-worth individuals and families,1 most of them apply to virtually everyone.

## **Focus on Objectives and Planning Strategies**

Private wealth management focuses on meeting a person's or family's overall financial objectives and the planning strategies for doing so. In this regard, the following classification of objectives provides a systematic way for determining, analyzing, and planning for these goals and expectations.

## **Capital Accumulation**

People may want to accumulate capital for a variety of reasons. Some of these are listed below.

**Emergency Fund** An emergency fund may be needed to meet unexpected expenses, to pay for deliberately retained exposures to loss, and to provide a financial cushion against the risks of life (including economic recession or depression).

The size of an emergency fund varies and depends on such factors as family income, number of income earners, stability of employment, assets, debts, insurance deductibles, uncovered health and property exposures, and the family's general attitudes toward risk. It often is expressed as so many months of family income—such as 3 to 12 months—but may be a fixed amount.

**Education Needs** The cost of higher education has increased dramatically, particularly at private colleges and universities. The size of an education fund depends on the number of children or other recipients, their ages, their educational plans, any available financial aid, and the size of the family's available assets and income. It also depends on the attitudes of the family toward education. The issue of financing education costs is covered in Part IV of this book.

**Retirement Needs** Because of the importance and unique characteristics of this objective, it is dealt with as a separate objective in Part V of this book.

<sup>1</sup>Who constitutes a high-net-worth person or family varies among commentators. But just as an example, in its annual *World Wealth Report* Merrill Lynch and Capgemini Consulting consider high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) to be people holding more than \$1,000,000 in financial assets. Other wealth management professionals may use higher or lower amounts in their definitions.

**General Investment Fund** People often accumulate capital for general investment purposes. They may want a better standard of living in the future, a second income in addition to their earnings, greater financial security, the ability to retire early, or a capital fund to pass on to their children or grandchildren, or they may simply enjoy the investment process.

#### **Investment and Property Management (Money Management)**

**Need for Management** The desire to obtain professional investment and property management varies considerably among individuals and families. However, the increasing complexity of investments, volatility of financial markets, economic uncertainties, tax problems, and the like generally have increased the desire for professional management in this area.

#### **Sources of Aid for Investment and Property Management**

*Use of Financial Intermediaries:* Broadly speaking, a financial intermediary is a financial institution that invests people's money and pays them a return on that money. Such institutions serve as conduits for savings into appropriate investments. They may include the following:

- N Investment companies (mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, closed-end investment companies, and unit investment trusts)
- N Commercial banks (offering certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and various types of savings accounts)
- N Life insurance companies
- N Savings institutions
- N In real estate, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and tenant in common (TIC) plans

*Trusts:* One of the basic reasons for establishing trusts is to provide experienced and knowledgeable investment and property management for the beneficiaries of the trust (who may include the creator of the trust).

*Investment Advisers and Advisory Firms:* There are many investment advisers and advisory firms, ranging in size and types of services provided, who offer their clients professional investment advice on a fee basis. Many commercial banks and securities firms also offer investment advisory services.

In terms of investment decision-making authority, investment advisers may operate (1) on a strictly discretionary basis, under which the adviser actually makes investment decisions and buys and sells securities for the client without prior consultation with the client, (2) under an arrangement whereby the adviser basically makes investment decisions but consults with the client before taking action, and (3) under an arrangement by which the adviser and client consult extensively before investment decisions are made, but clients reserve the actual decision making for themselves.

Investment advisers are regulated under the *Investment Advisers Act of 1940* and similar state laws. The 1940 Act defines investment advisers as persons who, for compensation, engage in the business of advising others, either directly or through publications or writing, as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities; or who, for compensation and as a part of a regular business, issue or promulgate analyses or reports concerning securities. Such advisers with \$25 million or more under management must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Advisers managing lesser amounts must meet state registration requirements in states where they operate. The 1940 Act also regulates certain investment adviser activities, such as advisory contract terms, fees, advertising, client solicitation, disclosures to clients, and record keeping.

Some persons and entities are specifically exempted from the Act. They include bankers; attorneys; accountants, engineers, and teachers who provide investment advice that is incidental to the practice of their profession; brokers or dealers who provide investment advice incidental to the conduct of their business and who do not charge special compensation for such advice; publishers of bona fide newspapers, news magazines, or financial publications; and certain other exemptions.

Investment advisers have a fiduciary relationship with their clients. Thus, they must deal with clients in good faith and operate in the clients' best interests.

*Independent Financial Planners:* These are persons and organizations that provide coordinated planning services for their clients on a fee-forservice basis or as part of their services in connection with the sale of financial products. They often provide planning with respect to investments and property management, as well as in a number of other areas. Depending on the nature and size of their practice, financial planners may fall under the definition of investment adviser and would need to register with the SEC under the 1940 Act or under an applicable state law.

*Securities Firms:* Investors can obtain valuable investment and research advice from account executives and others with stock brokerage firms. It must be pointed out, however, that the relationship between stockbrokers and their clients is not the same as that of investment advisers or trust departments and their clients. Brokers often are paid commissions based on the transactions in their customers' accounts, while advisers and trustees usually are paid an annual fee that is a percentage of the assets under their management. However, professionally minded brokers recognize that their long-term success ultimately depends on the investment success of their customers, and they act accordingly. Also, other compensation arrangements for brokers now are being used.

*Other Advisers:* There are several other important sources from whom individuals can secure aid. Attorneys provide legal and other advice. Accountants provide advice concerning financial affairs, particularly in the tax area. Mutual fund representatives and persons offering tax-sheltered and other investments can provide advice on how these vehicles can be used in financial planning. Life insurance agents and brokers can offer advice concerning life insurance, health insurance, annuities, and other retirement plans, as well as other financial products and services. Similarly, property and liability insurance agents and brokers provide advice on personal risk management, property and liability insurance, and other financial products and services. Furthermore, real estate brokers and other professionals in that area can provide aid concerning real estate investments and management.

**Costs and Investment Management** It must be recognized that there are always charges, in one fashion or another, when people hire someone else (a professional) to manage their money. The charges may be in the form of an annual *asset-based percentage fee* (such as 1 percent of assets under management), like those charged by professional trustees and investment advisers, often with a minimum annual fee of, for example, \$1,500 to \$3,000. Investment companies (e.g., mutual funds) charge *annual expense ratios* as a percentage of fund assets for investment management and other expenses. Variable annuities and variable life insurance have asset-based fees at both the policy level (called mortality and expense risk charges) and the fund level (an expense ratio) for investment management services and other costs. Independent financial planners have various compensation arrangements.

Investment management costs also may be embedded in the structure of investment products and services. For example, investment expenses of banks, thrift institutions, and insurance companies are recovered based on the difference between the returns they earn on their own investments and the interest rates they pay to their customers on products like certificates of deposit (CDs), saving accounts, money market accounts, fixed-dollar life insurance policies and annuities, and the like. Stockbrokers usually are compensated for investment advice through the commissions they earn. Likewise, other professionals are compensated through fees or commissions for the services they provide. As different financial products are discussed throughout this book, their cost structures will be part of the analysis. The real question is not whether there are charges for investment services and advice—of course there are—but rather whether those charges are reasonable in relation to the returns and benefits achieved.

## **Income Tax Planning (Reducing the Tax Burden)**

Most people have the legitimate objective of reducing their tax burden as much as legally possible. People may be subject to many different taxes. These include the federal income tax (including the alternative minimum tax), state and local income taxes, federal estate tax, state death taxes, federal gift tax, the federal tax on generation-skipping transfers (GSTs), and Social Security and other employment-related taxes. This objective is concerned with income tax planning. Estate, gift, and GST tax savings are dealt with under estate planning.

#### **Financing Education Expenses**

This has become an important objective for many individuals and families as the need for higher education has become increasingly recognized and its cost has risen dramatically. In response to this need, there also have arisen some attractive, tax-efficient plans for financing education costs, such as qualified tuition (Section 529) plans. Planning strategies for financing education expenses are covered in Part IV.

## **Retirement Planning (Provision of Retirement Income)**

This objective also has become increasingly prominent. This is because today most people can anticipate living to enjoy a long period of retirement (possibly lasting into their 80s, 90s, or even beyond); retirement planning itself has become so complex; there is debate as to whether people are saving enough to finance their retirements adequately; and currently, economic recession or depression is depleting the value of many retirement accounts. Also, some people are thinking about retiring early (i.e., well before age 65). Consequently, much planning today has to do with the provision of adequate retirement income and planning for how to take distributions from various retirement plans. Retirement planning is covered in Part V.

#### **Protection against Personal Risks**

This objective involves planning for the many risks that may cause personal losses, such as medical expenses, disability of income earners, custodial care (long-term care) expenses, death, and property and liability losses. Dealing with these exposures often is called *personal risk management.*

**Medical Care Expenses** There is little need to convince most people of the importance of protecting themselves and their families against medical care costs. For planning purposes, we can divide medical costs into the following categories:

*Normal or Budgetable Expenses:* These are expenses the family can pay out of its regular monthly budget. Traditional thinking holds that, as a general principle, the more of these expenses a family can assume, the lower its overall costs will be. This is the concept of *retention* in personal risk management.

*Larger-than-Normal and Catastrophic Expenses:* These are expenses that exceed normal ones and may be so large as to cause severe financial strain (catastrophic expenses), even for high-net-worth families. They obviously are important to plan for, and normally cannot be deliberately retained. Planning strategies for these expenses are covered in Chapter 22.

**Disability Income Losses** Loss of earned income due to the disability of an income earner can be referred to as the *disability income exposure.*

*Significance of the Disability Income Exposure:* Such an exposure, particularly total and permanent disability, is a serious risk.2 Many experts agree that consumers should give greatest attention to protecting against long-term disability rather than being unduly concerned with disabilities that last only a few weeks. Using the figures in Footnote 2, it may be suggested that not many families can afford the loss of one or both of the breadwinners' earnings for four or more years.

*Planning Strategies:* Disability income insurance is the main source of protection against the disability exposure, particularly long-term disabilities. Depending on the circumstances, part of this exposure (such as losses from short-term disabilities) can be retained through the emergency fund. Sometimes, investment income can replace part or even all of a disabled person's earned income in the case of high-net-worth persons. Most people with earned income are covered by Social Security disability benefits. Also, some employers provide their employees with disability benefits of various types.

<sup>2</sup> Interestingly, the probability that someone will suffer a serious long-term disability (of 90 days or more) prior to age 65 is considerably greater than the probability of death at all ages prior to age 65. As examples of the importance of the disability exposure, according to Society of Actuaries data, a person age 30 has a 24 percent probability of having a disability lasting 90 days or more before reaching age 65 and a person age 50 has a corresponding probability of 18 percent. These figures illustrate the *average frequency* of such a serious disability. Data on *average severity* are equally startling. For persons under age 40, the average duration (severity) of a disability lasting 90 days or more is four years, while the corresponding average duration for persons ages 50 to 54 is four years, six months.

However, many people with earned income find they must supplement these sources of disability protection by purchasing individual disability income policies.

In planning for this exposure, the adviser and the client may pursue the strategy of assuming the worst—that the client (or another income earner in the family) may become totally and permanently disabled (unable to have an earned income) from now until his or her normal retirement. In addition, consideration must be given to the impact that disability during a person's working years will have on his or her available retirement income. Given such a worst-case scenario, what the person will receive from existing disability income insurance, other benefits, and income from other sources can be determined. Recommendations then can be made to deal with any shortfalls in needed aftertax disability income. Chapter 22 covers planning for this exposure.

**Custodial Care (Long-Term Care) Expenses** These are expenses incurred to maintain persons when they are unable to perform at least several of the normal activities of daily living.

*How It Differs from Medical Care:* This category of expenses is for *custodial care,* when persons are no longer able to care for themselves, rather than for the treatment and potentially the cure of *acute medical conditions.* Custodial care can take a variety of forms, such as skilled nursing home care, intermediate institutional (assisted living facility) care, adult day care, and home health care.

Medical expense coverages, such as Medicare and private health insurance, provide little to no coverage for custodial care expenses. With increasing longevity and the high cost of custodial care, planning for these expenses has become an increasingly important objective.

*Planning Strategies: Long-term care (LTC) insurance* is the private insurance approach to meeting this exposure. Starting around age 50, or even younger, LTC insurance should be part of most peoples' insurance portfolio. Of course, very high-net-worth persons may be able to finance this exposure from their investment income or assets. At what level of wealth such selffunding may become an appropriate strategy is debatable.

Unfortunately, many older people do not have adequate LTC insurance or other income and resources to meet the custodial care exposure. A planning strategy in this situation may be to enable the person needing care to qualify for Medicaid (the federal-state medical assistance program for the needy), which does cover nursing home and other custodial care, while still planning to pass as much of the person's assets as possible to his or her family. This is referred to as *Medicaid planning.* For people who do not have other options, Medicaid planning may be an appropriate strategy. However, reliance on Medicaid to meet the custodial care exposure is highly problematic for most people. The *Deficit Reduction Act of 2005* has made Medicaid planning considerably more difficult. Public policy in this area clearly seems to be to encourage people to plan in advance by purchasing long-term care insurance.

Planning for custodial care expenses is covered in Chapter 23.

**Death** A major objective of most people is to protect their families or others from the financial consequences of their deaths. People also may be concerned with the impact of their deaths on their business affairs or their estate's liquidity and conservation picture.

#### *Potential Losses and Needs at Death:* These include the following:

- N *Loss of the Deceased's Future Earning Power.* Most families live on the earned income from one or both spouses. The death of an income earner results in the loss of that person's future earnings. This has sometimes been referred to as a person's *human life value*. In addition, the death of a family member working in the home may result in increased expenses because of the need to replace his or her services.
- N *Loss of Funds to Meet Future Needs or Objectives.* These may include funds for children's education and amounts needed to satisfy mortgages and other large debts.
- N *Liquidity Needs of a Decedent's Estate.* Any federal estate tax due generally is payable no later than nine months after the decedent's death. It is payable by the executor or administrator of the estate. Depending on the jurisdictions involved, there also may be substantial state death taxes due. Thus, for high-net-worth persons, these taxes often will create substantial *liquidity needs* for their estates (i.e., the need for ready cash to pay taxes and other obligations). There also will be estate settlement costs and debts that must be paid from the estate.
- N *Estate Shrinkage.* Even assuming an estate has adequate liquid assets or other resources with which to pay its taxes and other obligations, larger estates often suffer considerable reduction in value due to federal and state death taxes. This *estate shrinkage* will substantially reduce the wealth passing to the estate owner's heirs if steps are not taken to reduce the shrinkage or to make up for it. Strategies to deal with such shrinkage may be referred to as *estate conservation* measures.
- N *Loss of Business Values.* When an owner of a closely held business dies, the business also may die financially or suffer considerable loss in value. Also, many businesses have key employees, whether owners or not, whose death can cause considerable financial loss to the business.

*Planning Strategies:* Life insurance is the primary vehicle for providing cash to meet the losses arising out of a person's death. Various strategies can be applied to determine the types and amounts of life insurance needed in a particular case. These strategies are discussed in Chapters 21 and 29.

**Property Damage and Legal Liability Exposures** There are a variety of such exposures, which can cause substantial financial loss. Most people carry insurance against basic exposures, like auto and homeowners' policies, but careful planning is necessary to consider all the exposures a person or family may have and to make sure their insurance coverages have adequate limits. This is particularly true for high-net-worth persons, who usually have diverse interests, highly valued properties and collections, and property held in trust. They also frequently serve on boards of directors.

*Property Losses:* Ownership of property brings with it the risk of loss to the property itself (*direct losses*) and loss of use of the property (*indirect or consequential losses*). A planning decision in this area is how much exposure should be assumed (usually through policy deductibles) and how much should be insured.

*Liability Losses:* By virtue of almost everything a person may do, he or she is exposed to possible liability claims by others. Such liability can arise out of the person's own negligent acts, the negligent acts of others for whom the person may be legally responsible, liability he or she may have assumed under a contract (such as a lease), liability imposed by statute (such as workers' compensation laws), liability from board memberships, and liability for certain intentional acts (intentional torts) done by the person. Since a large liability claim potentially can be financially devastating, identifying and evaluating liability exposures and planning for adequate liability insurance to cover these exposures are critical.

*Planning Strategies:* A risk management (insurance) survey, with a checklist of potential exposures, is an approach to identifying and evaluating these risks. Property appraisals for insurance valuation purposes may be called for. A strategic issue is determining which exposures should not be insured (retained) and what, if any, deductibles (cost sharing) should be used for the exposures that are insured. Risk management principles for property and liability exposures are covered in Chapter 24.

**Health-Care Decision Making and Property Management in Case of Physical and Mental Incapacity** These issues arise when people become physically and mentally incapacitated and unable to make important decisions for themselves. There generally is more concern about these issues as people age, but as some recent high-profile cases illustrate, adults of any age may find themselves in this unfortunate situation.

*Health-Care Decision Making:* This area of planning involves preparing directives and making arrangements for a person's health care and other matters if he or she becomes no longer capable of making decisions on such matters. The planning strategies used are also covered in Chapter 30.

*Property Management:* The incapacity of someone who owns property and has other financial affairs gives rise to special problems because the incapacitated person will be unable to handle his or her own affairs effectively. The planning strategies in this situation are covered in Chapter 30.

#### **Estate Planning (Planning for One's Heirs)**

*Nature and Scope of Planning:* An estate plan has been defined as "an arrangement for the devolution of one's wealth." For some people, such an arrangement can be relatively simple. But for high-net-worth persons who are or will be subject to the federal transfer tax system (and perhaps state transfer taxes as well), and for those whose estate situation can present special problems, estate planning can become complex.

Estate planning often involves planning during an estate owner's lifetime, at his or her death, and for the management and devolution of his or her property long after the owner's death. It thus is broad in scope and touches on planning for many of the other objectives noted here.

*Planning Strategies:* As noted, estate planning may be broad in scope and can involve planning over a person's or family's entire economic lifecycle and after death. The estate planning process and strategies are described in Part VIII.

**Charitable Giving** Most people have charitable objectives to some degree. Others, who may have larger resources, may establish sophisticated systems for their charitable giving. In many cases, charitable planning is integrated with other objectives, such as income tax planning, retirement planning, and estate planning. Strategies for charitable giving are discussed in Part VI and in other parts of the book.

**Business Planning** In situations where closely held business interests are the main or an important part of a person's or family's wealth, planning for those interests is an important objective. This planning can involve choice of business entity; business operations, compensation arrangements, and employee benefits to maximize wealth for the family; and business succession plans, among other issues. Part IX deals with this area of planning.

**Special Circumstances** A final objective is the possibility, even the probability, that clients will have one or more special circumstances that should be considered in their planning. These may include the following:

- N Existing disabilities, incapacities, illness, and even terminal illness of the person or family members.
- N Dependents with special needs. This relates to dependents who qualify or who may need to qualify for government-provided assistance based on need. Special-needs trusts (covered in Chapter 25) may be called for in such situations.
- N Marital issues in the family. This may involve marital problems, such as separations or divorces of the person, his or her children and grandchildren, and possibly other family members.
- N Related to the previous point is whether the person or his or her spouse has been married before and whether there are children from the previous marriage or marriages.
- N In the case of nontraditional families, partnerships, unions, and companionships, special planning issues often arise.
- N The nature of the person's employment and job security obviously has an effect on planning. It also is significant if the person is planning to change jobs or retire soon, and if both the person and his or her spouse are employed outside the home.
- N The possibility of future gifts and inheritances also will affect planning.

These special circumstances will be discussed throughout the book as appropriate.

## **Financial Planning Process**

The financial planning process involves the translation of personal objectives into specific plans and finally into financial arrangements to implement those plans. To this end, following is an overview of the steps in this process.

## **Establishing Client-Planner Relationships**

A review of the preceding objectives and planning strategies reveals the broad scope and complexity of private wealth management. Naturally, not all of these objectives apply to all persons, but most of them do. It is virtually certain, therefore, that individuals and families who need comprehensive private wealth management will need to retain the services of one and very likely several professional advisers in the various planning areas just noted. No one person can be an expert in them all.

#### **16 Part I. Introduction**

These professional advisers include lawyers, investment advisers and asset managers, financial planners, accountants, life insurance agents and brokers, trust officers, property and liability insurance agents and brokers, valuation experts, and others. In some cases, one professional or firm will initiate planning and then bring in other professionals as needed. In many cases, however, the client deals independently with a number of professional advisers in the areas of their expertise. Either way, it is important for the client and planner to establish the scope and nature of the services to be provided, the client's objectives, limits on the planner's responsibilities and when the planning will end, any potential conflicts of interest, and the compensation arrangements involved, if necessary.

#### **Gathering Data and Determining Goals and Expectations**

The kinds of information needed vary with the situation, but they may include information about the person's or family's investments; homes and other properties; retirement plans, employer stock plans, and other employee benefits; tax situation (income, estate, and gift taxes); life, health, long-term care, and property and liability insurance policies; wills, trusts, and other estate planning documents; powers of attorney and related instruments; and similar documents and information.

In summarizing a person's present financial position, it is helpful to prepare some personal financial statements. These are much like those businesses use, except that business statements normally are prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), while personal or family statements normally reflect cash transactions (rather than on an accrual basis) and value assets at their fair market value (rather than at the lower of original cost less depreciation or fair market value).

Personal financial statements can include a *statement of financial position*  (also called a personal balance sheet), which provides a picture of a person's or family's assets, liabilities, and net worth as of a given point in time, and a *statement of cash flow*, which shows the person's or family's cash income, cash expenditures, and resultant savings (or cash flow). This cash flow statement is similar in concept to a business's income statement, except it shows only cash transactions rather than income and expenses on an accrual basis, and has other differences. A sample statement of financial position (Table 1.1) and statement of cash flow (Table 1.2) for a hypothetical family are given in the next section of this chapter.

However, as noted, depending on the purpose and scope of the planning being done, a variety of other data may need to be gathered. Furthermore, information about the person, his or her family, and other persons or institutions the person may want to benefit will be needed for estate planning and other purposes. Gathering adequate data, particularly about personal matters, often is a challenge for private wealth management professionals. In this process, they may use checklists, questionnaires, work forms, and personal interviews or some combination of these techniques for this purpose.

Next, the person must determine his or her financial goals and expectations. This, in essence, is articulating his or her objectives as outlined in the previous sections of this chapter.

## **Determining the Person's Financial Status**

This involves analyzing the person's general financial status in relation to his or her goals and expectations (objectives) as determined in the previous steps.

## **Developing and Presenting the Financial Plan**

Given the facts of the case, the person's objectives, an analysis of his or her present financial position, and consideration of alternatives, recommendations can be made for a financial plan to meet the indicated objectives.

## **Implementing the Financial Plan**

A financial plan, no matter how soundly conceived, is only as good as its actual implementation. Many excellent plans are only partly implemented or not implemented at all. For example, an estate plan may be developed and agreed to by the client, and wills, trusts, and other documents may be drafted and executed, but then asset titles and beneficiary designations may not actually be changed to correspond to the well-conceived plan. Clearly, wealth management professionals should do their best to make sure their agreed-upon recommendations are actually implemented for their clients.

## **Monitoring the Financial Plan**

No plan should be considered "cast in bronze." Circumstances change. There are births, marriages, divorces, deaths, job changes, different economic conditions, and a host of other factors that may make revisions in financial plans desirable or necessary. Hence, monitoring the plan and making necessary revisions are important activities in the financial planning process.

## **Case Example – Personal Financial Statements**

John and Mary Henderson, ages 52 and 48, respectively, are engaging in private wealth management and have the following personal financial statements: a *statement of financial position* and a *statement of cash flow.* John is a marketing manager for a large publicly traded corporation, while Mary has recently returned to high school teaching after taking time off to raise (with John) their two children and be a homemaker. Their two children are ages 14 and 19. The 19-year-old is now in college. John and Mary also are helping support John's 82-year-old mother.

The sample statements are for the combined assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of John and Mary. Statements for each of them separately could be prepared, if desired.

The categories of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses in these statements have been selected to facilitate the planning process. They normally are good starting points, but are not meant to be exhaustive. They, of course, can be modified to fit the planner's needs and purposes. In addition, financial concerns and wealth management professionals will have their own checklists, questionnaires, forms, and reports as appropriate for their areas of expertise.

#### **Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet)**

Table 1.1 is the statement of financial position for the Hendersons. Dollar amounts are stated in even thousands for the sake of convenience. Assets are valued at their current fair market values, account values, and cash values, except for John's vested and "in the money" stock options, which are valued at their intrinsic value (the stock's fair market value less the option exercise price times the number of vested unexercised options). See Chapter 18 for a discussion of valuing stock options.

| Assets                                                          |          |  |

#### **Statement of Cash Flow**

Table 1.2 shows the statement of cash flow for the Hendersons as of the most recent 12-month period. All transactions are recorded on a cash basis. The items of income and expenses are selected to show the family's economic activities over the time period and to facilitate planning. Other breakdowns of income and expenses can, of course, be used as desired.

#### **Other Planning Statements and Projections**

The previously cited statements of financial position and cash flow give a picture of the person's or family's overall economic position as of a given point or period of time. However, a number of other forms, statements, or projections also may be prepared for in-depth planning in a variety of areas.

These might include the following items, among others:

- N A listing of investments held by asset class (e.g., common stocks, bonds, investment companies, real estate, other alternative investments, and so forth), including current values, when acquired, tax bases, yields, and other investment data for asset allocation and investment planning purposes.
- N Pro forma income tax returns for tax planning.
- N Projections of future education costs and resources for education financing.
- N Projections of retirement income needs and sources of retirement income (including distribution planning).
- N A listing of employee stock options (and other stock compensation plans) for asset allocation purposes and for planning how and when to exercise options.

- N An analysis of lump-sum and income needs in case of the client's and his or her spouse's deaths for life insurance planning.
- N An analysis of income needs in case of the client's and his or her spouse's long-term disability for disability income planning.
- N An analysis of potential transfer-tax (e.g., estate tax) liabilities and other estate settlement costs and probate and nonprobate asset distribution patterns, first on the assumption that the client dies first followed by the death of his or her spouse, then on the assumption that the order of deaths is reversed for estate planning purposes. Personal family data will also be gathered for estate planning and other planning purposes.

## **Ethics and Wealth Management**

The various professionals who offer advice and services in this field are subject to codes of professional conduct and regulations. These codes and regulations vary among the professional groups, but often deal with:

- N Competence required of a professional in the field
- N Confidentiality regarding client information and other matters
- N Conflicts of interest in dealing with clients and required disclosure of such conflicts
- N Compensation for services rendered and any requirements for disclosure of such compensation
- N Principles involved in proper professional conduct
- N Compliance with and enforcement of rules and procedures

A discussion of the codes and rules of all relevant professions is beyond the scope of this book. However, as examples, following is a listing of some professions and groups, with accompanying Web sites where the reader can find the complete rules and practice standards for each (in alphabetical order).
