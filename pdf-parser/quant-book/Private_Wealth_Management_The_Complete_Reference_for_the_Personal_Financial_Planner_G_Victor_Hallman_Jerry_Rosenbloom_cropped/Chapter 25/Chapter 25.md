Estate planning can be defined as arranging for the transfer of a person's property from one generation to another so as to achieve, as much as possible, the person's objectives for his or her family and perhaps others. In our tax-oriented economy, tax minimization often is an important motivator for estate planning. Tax saving, however, is not the only goal of estate planning and should not be overemphasized.

# **Objectives of Estate Planning**

The following are a number of specific estate planning objectives, some or all of which apply to most people:

- N Determining who will be the estate owner's heirs or beneficiaries and how much each will receive.
- N Planning adequate financial support for the estate owner's dependents.
- N Reducing estate transfer costs (death taxes, expenses of administration, and the like) to a minimum, consistent with the estate owner's other objectives.
- N Planning for the way in which the estate owner's heirs or beneficiaries are to receive the assets passing to them. This often involves the question of whether they are to receive assets outright or in trust, and if a trust is to be used, what its terms, conditions, and duration should be, as well as who should be the trustee or trustees.
- N Providing sufficient liquid assets for the estate to meet its obligations.
- N Planning for possible arrangements (such as irrevocable life insurance trusts) that will conserve the estate for the owner's heirs and beneficiaries in the face of inevitable shrinkage due to taxes and expenses.
- N Deciding who is to settle the estate. This involves selecting the executor or coexecutors.
- N Planning how the estate owner's property is to be distributed. The methods of property disposition are outlined in the next section.
- N Planning for the disposition of any closely held business interests.
- N Planning for any charitable giving.

# **Property and Property Interests**

In general, *property* is anything that can be owned. Basically, there are two kinds of property: real property and personal property. *Real property* (or real estate) is land and everything attached to the land with the intention that it be part of the land. *Personal property* is all other kinds of property. Personal property can be *tangible—*property that has physical substance, such as a car, jewelry, art, or antiques—or it can be *intangible—*property that does not have physical substance, such as a stock certificate, bond, bank deposit, or life insurance policy.

# **Forms of Property Ownership**

**Outright Ownership** Outright or sole owners hold property in their own names and can deal with it during their lifetimes. They can sell it, use it as collateral, or give it away. They can also pass it on to their heirs by will as they wish, within some broad limits.

**Joint Ownership (or Concurrent Interests in Property)** This exists when two or more persons have ownership rights in the same property at the same time. The more important kinds of joint ownership are as follows.

*Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship:* The outstanding characteristic of joint tenancy with right of survivorship (WROS) is that if one of the joint owners dies, all ownership in the property passes automatically, by operation of law, to the other joint owner(s). This is the meaning of "with right of survivorship." Thus, if John and his wife Mary own their residence as joint tenants WROS and John dies, Mary automatically owns the residence (now in her own name) by right of survivorship. The same would be true if John and his daughter Susan owned some investment real estate as joint tenants WROS. Joint tenancy WROS can exist between anyone. However, it often exists between husband and wife, and sometimes between parents and children. During the lifetime of the joint tenants, the survivorship aspect can be destroyed by one of the joint tenants through a sale of his or her interest, attachment by his or her creditors, or a court action for partition. The parties then own the property as tenants in common.

*Tenancy by the Entirety:* In some states, this form of ownership exists when property is held jointly by a husband and wife. It is similar to a joint tenancy, but there are some differences. Tenancy by the entirety exists only between husband and wife. Also, in many states, the survivorship rights in it cannot be terminated except with the consent of both parties.

Property held as tenants by the entirety generally is protected against the claims of creditors of one of the parties, with some exceptions such as tax claims of the U.S. government. This creditor protection may vary in some states that allow this form of joint ownership. Thus, holding property as tenants by the entireties can be an aspect of asset protection planning.

The fact that property is held as joint tenants or tenants by the entirety does not mean it has to stay that way. The joint owners can agree to split up their interests. Also, as just noted in the case of joint tenancy (but not tenancy by the entirety), one joint tenant acting alone can sever (partition) the joint ownership into tenants in common. The advantages and disadvantages of joint ownership are discussed in Chapter 30.

*Other Joint Interests:* There are some other forms of joint ownership that involve the right of survivorship. These include joint bank accounts, some joint brokerage accounts, and jointly owned government savings bonds.

*Tenancy in Common:* The main difference between this and the previous kinds of joint ownership is that tenants in common do not have the right of survivorship.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose John and his brother Frank own investment real estate equally as tenants in common. If John dies, his half of the real estate goes to his heirs under his will. Frank, of course, retains his half interest. Tenants in common can have different proportionate interests in the property. For example, John and Frank could have 75 and 25 percent interests, respectively. Joint tenants WROS and tenants by the entirety always have equal interests.

**Community Property** Eight states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Washington) are community property states. In addition, the Uniform Marital Property Act (UMPA) provides each spouse owns one-half of property acquired during marriage, with certain exceptions. This is called *marital property.* Wisconsin has adopted the UMPA. While there are some technical differences, marital property is essentially the same as community property. Finally, Alaska allows married couples to elect to treat some assets as marital property.

The other states are referred to as *common-law states.* In these states, the forms of property ownership described previously apply. However, in the nine community property or marital property states, the situation is quite different with respect to property owned by husbands and wives.

*General Principles:* In community property states, husbands and wives can own separate property and community property. While the laws of community property states are not uniform, *separate property* generally consists of property that a husband or wife owned before marriage, property that each individually inherits or receives as a gift, separate property before the couple became domiciled in a community property state, and property purchased with separate property funds. This property remains separate, and the ownerspouse can deal with it as he or she chooses. Income from separate property may remain separate property or become community property, depending on the community property state involved.

*Community property,* on the other hand, generally consists of property that either spouse acquires during marriage from his or her earnings while domiciled in a community property or marital property state. Each spouse has an undivided one-half interest in community property. While the husband and wife are both alive, the applicable community property law determines who has the rights of management and control over the community property. However, upon his or her death, each spouse can dispose of only his or her half of the community property by will.

However, even those living in noncommunity property states can have community property. This can happen if spouses once lived in a community property state and acquired community property there. Such property remains community property even after the owners move to a common-law state. Also, property acquired by spouses while domiciled in a common-law

#### **584 Part VIII. Estate Planning**

state does not become community property when they move to a community property state.

Community property laws generally presume that all property owned by a married couple domiciled in the state is community property or marital property, regardless of how it is actually titled, unless there is an agreement between the parties about the status of the property that provides otherwise or there is proof that the property is separate property. Thus, if community property and separate property are commingled, and if adequate records are not kept so that the separate property can be traced, this presumption normally will cause all the commingled property to become community property. How community property is titled (as solely owned by one spouse, for example) does not matter. It will be treated as community property if that is what it is.

Spouses or prospective spouses can enter into agreements about the community property or separate property status of property they own or will acquire in the future. Such prenuptial or postnuptial agreements are recognized in all community property and marital property states. These agreements must, of course, conform to the requirements of state law. (Marital agreements in general are discussed later in this chapter.)

*Planning Issues:* Planning for community property can be complicated and generally is beyond the scope of this book. However, it may be noted that holding property as community property even after the parties have moved to a common-law state may have several advantages. Perhaps foremost is that for federal income tax purposes, all of community or marital property currently gets a stepped-up income tax basis at death, even though only half its value is included in the gross estate of a deceased spouse. By contrast, for other property interests, only property included in a decedent's gross estate gets a stepped-up basis. For federal estate tax purposes, community property automatically is divided equally between the spouses. There also may be fractional interest valuation discounts in the case of community property because each spouse owns only an undivided one-half interest.

#### **Other Property Interests**

There are other interests in property that are commonly involved in estate planning. An example can help illustrate these interests.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that by his will, A leaves property to the XYZ Bank *in trust* to keep it invested and to distribute the net income from it to his wife, B, if she survives him, during her lifetime. At B's death, or at A's death if B does not survive him, the property is to go outright in equal shares to C and D (A's adult children) or their issue.

**Legal Interests and Equitable Interests** In this example, upon A's death, the XYZ Bank technically becomes legal owner of the property that passes into the trust. However, the bank must exercise ownership rights as trustee according to the terms of the trust agreement. The trustee acts in a *fiduciary capacity* with respect to the trust. B, C, and D have equitable (or beneficial) interests in the property, since it is held for their benefit.

**Life Interests, Term Interests, and Remainder Interests** A *life interest* in property entitles the holder to the income from or the use of the property, or a portion of the property, for his or her lifetime. A *term interest* entitles the holder to the income or the use of the property, or a portion of the property, for a term of years. The *remainder interest* (or remainderperson) is entitled to the property itself after a life interest or term interest has ended. In the example just given, B has a life interest in the trust property. C and D (or their issue—for example, children—if they are deceased) have remainder interests and are remainderpersons. Life interests usually are created by trusts, but there can also be legal life estates without a trust.

Furthermore, trusts may give the *grantor* (the creator of a trust) an income or use interest, an annuity interest, or a unitrust interest in the trust for a term of years, followed by a remainder interest in someone else. These are called grantor-retained income trusts (GRITs), grantor-retained annuity trusts (GRATs), and grantor-retained unitrusts (GRUTs).1

**Present Interests and Future Interests** A *present interest* exists in property when the holder has a present and immediate right to the use, possession, or enjoyment of the property. With a *future interest,* the right to use or enjoy the property is postponed to some future time or is in the control of someone other than the holder. In the previous example, upon A's death, B has a present interest in the trust income because she has the immediate right to it for her lifetime. C and D have future interests because their rights to the property are postponed until B's death. As we shall see later in Chapter 27, the concepts of present and future interests are important in connection with gift tax planning.

**Powers of Appointment** A *power of appointment* is a power or right given to a person (called the *donee of the power*) that enables the donee to designate,

<sup>1</sup>Note that the terms *annuity trust* and *unitrust* are the same as were used in Chapter 19 to describe CRATs and CRUTs. The ideas are essentially the same, except that the remainderperson in the case of GRATs and GRUTs is a noncharitable entity (e.g., a family member), while for CRATs and CRUTs, the remainderperson is a charity.

sometimes within certain limits, who is to get property that is subject to the power (called the *objects of the power*). The basic nontax purposes of powers of appointment are to postpone and delegate the decision about who is to get property until a later time when the circumstances can be better known. Powers also are used for estate tax and GST tax reasons, as will be explained later. There are several kinds of powers of appointment, as explained next.

*General Powers:* A *general power* is a power to appoint property to the person with the power (the donee), the donee's estate, the donee's creditors, or creditors of the donee's estate. It is close to owning the property. For federal estate tax purposes, property will be included in the gross estate of someone who has a general power over it.

*Special or Limited Powers (Nongeneral Powers):* These powers allow donees to appoint property only to certain persons who are not the donees themselves, their estate, their creditors, or the creditors of their estate. The possession of a special or limited power over property at a person's death does not result in the property's being included in the donee's gross estate.

*How Property Is Appointed:* When donees of either a general or nongeneral power can appoint the property only at their death, it is referred to as a power exercisable *by will,* or a *testamentary power.* A power exercisable *by deed* is one where donees can appoint the property only during their lifetime. The broadest power in this respect is one exercisable *by deed or will,* which is exercisable both ways.

*Powers Subject to an Ascertainable Standard:* When the exercise of a power by a person is subject to an *ascertainable standard* (such as for the person's health, education, maintenance, or support), it is not considered a general power for tax purposes; hence, the property subject to the power will not be included in the powerholder's gross estate. This point can be important in structuring trusts.

## **Marital Rights in Property**

This has become an increasingly important subject because of societal changes and other factors. The REA of 1984, which granted QPSA and QJSA rights to nonparticipant spouses in qualified retirement plans, has been covered in Chapter 13 and will not be repeated here.

**Spouse's Elective Share** With certain exceptions, people can leave their property by will to whomever they like. One important exception, however, is that in most common law (separate property) states, a husband or wife cannot deprive his or her surviving spouse of the spouse's statutory elective share of the estate. This is referred to as the *spouse's right to elect against the will.*  Taking against the will does not deny the will's validity, but simply involves the spouse's taking his or her elective share (forced share) allowed by law rather than what is left to him or her under the will.

Originally, elective share statutes only gave a surviving spouse rights to part of a deceased spouse's probate estate (which will be defined next). However, the *Uniform Probate Code* (UPC) modified this traditional approach by allowing a surviving spouse to elect to take part of his or her deceased spouse's *augmented estate.* The augmented estate includes probate and some nonprobate assets. Some states have adopted this approach. Then, in 1990, the UPC was revised and significant changes were made in its elective share provisions. These included expanding the augmented estate to include other assets and a surviving spouse's own property, and to base the percentage elective share on the length of the marriage (from 5 percent to 50 percent). A number of states have adopted this approach. Thus, there is considerable variation among state laws regarding the elective share.

To avoid a surviving spouse's electing to take against the will, persons with property may enter into prenuptial agreements (or postnuptial agreements after marriage) under which each party relinquishes in whole or in part his or her statutory rights to the other's property at death. Finally, it should be noted that, except in one state, children do not have any comparable right to a spouse's elective share in their parents' estates.

**Marital Rights upon Divorce** The states have adopted equitable-distribution statutes applying to so-called marital property in the event of divorce. Under these statutes, the appropriate court can divide a divorcing couple's marital property between the parties in an "equitable manner" according to certain factors specified in state domestic relations law, regardless of how title to the marital property is actually held.

What is considered marital property can vary among the states, but it may include all property acquired during marriage from the earnings of either spouse, with certain exceptions. Thus, it may not include, for example, property owned by a person before marriage or property acquired by a spouse by gift or inheritance. However, if this exempt property is commingled with marital property, and if adequate records are not kept so that nonmarital property can be traced, all the property may be considered marital property. Thus, if gift property is placed in an irrevocable trust (by a parent or grandparent, for example) for a trust beneficiary (child or grandchild), the corpus of the trust normally would clearly be identified as exempt property (gift property) in the event of the beneficiary's divorce (i.e., it would be "divorce-proof "). The same would be true for property placed in FLPs for gifts of limited partnership interests. Also, to avoid the effects of equitable distribution statutes or other divorce laws, persons who are about to marry are increasingly entering into prenuptial agreements that specify how their property is to be divided in the event of divorce.

**Prenuptial Agreements** For a variety of reasons, prenuptial (or antenuptial) agreements are becoming increasingly common. They are now recognized in virtually all states. However, the rules regarding these agreements vary among the states. There is a Uniform Prenuptial Agreement Act (UPAA), which has been adopted in about half the states. The UPAA requires such agreements be in writing and signed by both parties, and provides that the agreement can cover many issues, including the disposition of any property of either or both parties upon separation, marital dissolution, death, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event. A prenuptial agreement becomes effective with the marriage. The general rule is that spousal consent to an REA waiver in a prenuptial agreement is not effective. Consent must be given when the nonparticipant is a spouse. It is often necessary that there be full, fair, and reasonable disclosure of the property and obligations of the parties.

**Planning Considerations** We have seen in this chapter and elsewhere that marriage can create certain rights in the property of each spouse. However, for estate planning, retirement planning, or other reasons, spouses may want to relinquish or modify some of these marital rights. To review, the kinds of marital agreements that have been covered in this book are:

- N Waiver of REA rights in qualified retirement plans by the participant spouse and written consent to the waiver in the proper form by the nonparticipant spouse
- N Prenuptial and postnuptial agreements concerning spousal rights in property at death
- N Prenuptial and postnuptial agreements concerning spousal rights in property incident to divorce
- N Prenuptial and postnuptial agreements concerning community and separate property

# **What Is Meant by the "Estate"?**

## **Probate Estate**

The *probate estate* is the property that is handled and distributed by the personal representative (executor if there is a will; administrator if there is not) upon a person's death. Thus, probate property is the property disposed of by the decedent's will, including:

- N Property owned outright in the person's own name
- N Interests in property held as tenants in common

- N Proceeds or benefits payable to a person's estate at death
- N A person's half of community property

It is sometimes argued that having property pass through a decedent's probate estate is bad. This is not necessarily true—it depends on the circumstances. There are, however, some disadvantages in leaving property so that it will be part of a person's probate estate, such as:

- N There may be delay in settling the estate.
- N The costs of administering an estate (executor's fees, attorney's fees, etc.) may be based largely on the probate estate.
- N Assets in the probate estate are subject to creditor's claims.
- N The probate estate can be made public knowledge.
- N Disgruntled heirs may seek to contest a will and obtain probate assets.
- N Sometimes, state death taxes can be increased, depending on the property and the state involved.

On the other hand, having property bypass the probate estate is not an estate planning panacea. Cost savings from avoiding probate depend on the circumstances and may not be that significant. Furthermore, some commonly advocated methods for avoiding probate, such as the revocable living trust, have costs of their own (see Chapter 30). Other arrangements (such as jointly owned property) also may have problems (see Chapter 30). Therefore, avoiding probate is not an open-and-shut issue and should be evaluated carefully.

Most people have a probate estate. First, property owned outright at death must pass through the probate estate. Many people will hold property in a variety of ways during their lifetimes—some in the probate estate and some not. Furthermore, estate owners want their executors to have adequate assets to pay the claims, expenses, and taxes that their estates will owe and so will need to have property (especially liquid or marketable assets) in their probate estate.

#### **Gross Estate for Federal Estate Tax Purposes**

The gross estate is defined by the tax law and is the starting point for calculating how much, if any, federal estate tax is due. While the calculation of the gross estate is illustrated here, it is explained more fully in Chapter 26.

#### **State Death Tax Value**

Most states have some form of death tax. Some have *inheritance taxes,* which are levied on the right to receive property by inheritance; many have *estate taxes,* which are levied on the right to give property at death; and some have both.

#### **The Net Estate to One's Heirs**

The *net estate to one's heirs* is perhaps what is significant to most people. This estate consists of the assets that will go to one's heirs after the payment of the costs of dying (debts, claims, administration expenses, and taxes).

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

To illustrate these ideas, let us take the case of a successful executive, George Able, and his wife, Mary. They have three children, ages 22, 18, and 14. George's asset picture may be summarized as follows. He owns in his own name about \$1,500,000 worth of his employer's stock, which he acquired under the company's employee stock purchase plan and by exercising some NQSOs. He also owns in his own name about \$40,000 worth of other listed common stocks, \$100,000 worth of mutual fund shares, \$40,000 in a money market fund, and \$30,000 worth of tangible personal property. George and Mary own jointly (WROS) their main home, worth about \$680,000 and with a \$180,000 mortgage still due; their summer home, valued at about \$500,000 and with a \$30,000 mortgage still due; and savings and checking accounts of \$100,000. In addition to these mortgages, George has a \$40,000 bank loan outstanding and about \$10,000 of other personal debts.

Through his employer, George has group term life insurance of \$500,000, which is payable to Mary as primary beneficiary; a qualified profit-sharing plan, with \$600,000 credited to George's account; and a qualified savings plan with a Section 401(k) option, with \$1,000,000 credited to his account. The benefits of the profit-sharing and savings plans also are payable to Mary at George's death. Finally, George owns individually purchased life insurance policies on his life with total death benefits of \$800,000. This insurance is payable to George's estate as beneficiary.

George has a will that leaves everything outright to Mary if she survives him; otherwise, everything is left outright to his children in equal shares. George and Mary have always lived in commonlaw states. Thus, George's property interests can be summarized as follows:

| Property George owns outright in his own name: |             |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| His employer's common stock                    | \$1,500,000 |
| Other listed common stock                      | \$40,000    |
| Mutual fund shares                             | \$100,000   |
| Money market fund                              | \$40,000    |

| Tangible personal property                     | \$30,000    |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|                                                | \$1,710,000 |
| Property George and Mary own jointly (WROS):   |             |
| Principal residence                            | \$680,000   |
| Summer home                                    | \$500,000   |
| Bank accounts                                  | \$100,000   |
|                                                | \$1,280,000 |
| Life insurance George owns on his life:        |             |
| Group term life insurance, payable to Mary     |             |
| in a lump sum                                  | \$500,000   |
| Individual life insurance, payable to George's |             |
| estate in a lump sum                           | \$800,000   |
|                                                | \$1,300,000 |
| Retirement plan benefits:                      |             |
| Profit-sharing plan death benefit, payable     |             |
| to Mary                                        | \$600,000   |
| Savings plan death benefit, payable to Mary    | \$1,000,000 |
|                                                | \$1,600,000 |

Given these facts, if George were to die today, his *probate estate* would be \$2,510,000. This includes the \$1,710,000 of property George owns in his own name and the \$800,000 of life insurance proceeds payable to his estate. The rest of the assets pass to Mary outside of George's probate estate.

Again assuming if George were to die today, his *gross estate for federal estate tax purposes* would be calculated as follows. (The items included in the gross estate are described more fully in Chapter 26.)

| Property owned in the decedent's own name      | \$1,710,000 |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| One-half of property owned jointly (WROS)      |             |
| by him and Mary (\$1,280,000 ÷ 2 = \$640,000)2 | \$640,000   |
| Life insurance on George's life that he owned  |             |
| (i.e., in which he had incidents of ownership) |             |
| at the time of his death or was payable        |             |
| to his estate                                  | \$1,300,000 |
| Retirement plan death benefits                 | \$1,600,000 |
| Gross estate                                   | \$5,250,000 |
|                                                |             |

2One-half of jointly owned property (WROS) held by husband and wife is included in the gross estate of the first spouse to die. This is referred to as the *fractional interest rule.*

In this case, because of the unlimited federal estate tax marital deduction, there would be no federal estate tax payable at George's death as his estate now stands. However, as will be explained more fully in Chapter 28, it would be a better planning strategy if all of George's estate were not qualified (eligible) for the marital deduction. Only the proper amount should be qualified. This is because, as matters now stand, a greater-than-necessary tax burden probably will fall on Mary's estate when she subsequently dies. Let us also assume there would be no state death tax payable at George's death. Now, let us see what George can transmit to his family—his *net estate*. This is estimated as follows:

| Total asset and death benefits (including      |             |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| jointly owned property and retirement assets)3 | \$5,890,000 |
| Minus:                                         |             |
| George's debts (including the full amount      |             |
| of mortgages on homes)                         | \$260,000   |
| Estimated funeral and estate administration    |             |
| expenses                                       | \$55,000    |

| Net estate to George's family                  | \$5,575,000 |
|                                                |             |

# **Settling the Estate**

When a person dies, what happens to his or her property? This depends on whether the person died *intestate—*that is, without having made a valid will—or whether a valid will was made. People should make a valid will.

#### **Intestate Distribution**

If someone dies intestate, his or her probate estate is distributed according to the applicable state intestate law. An administrator, who is appointed by a court, handles the estate settlement. The estate owner has no voice in who will receive the property or who will be administrator. This should be avoided. The laws of intestate distribution vary among the states. A surviving

<sup>3</sup>The retirement assets would produce income (IRD) for the beneficiary (Mary, in this case) and hence result in an income tax liability for her (see Chapter 10). However, depending on her age, this tax liability can be deferred and so is not counted as "shrinkage" here.

spouse first is entitled to his or her statutory share of the estate.4 Then, there is a statutory order of distribution to persons other than a surviving spouse.

# **Problems with Intestate Distribution**

We noted that people normally should make a will. A number of problems can arise when a person dies intestate.

- N Perhaps most important is that intestate distribution is not chosen by the estate owner. It is dictated by the applicable state statute.
- N Beneficiaries receive their inheritances outright, without regard to their individual capacities to manage property. Guardians must be appointed for minor beneficiaries. Trusts cannot be used for the heirs.
- N The estate owner cannot select his or her executor.
- N Estate taxes may be increased because the surviving spouse's share may not be large enough to take full advantage of the marital deduction or, on the other hand, may be too large for efficient tax planning.

# **Distribution by Will**

A *will* is a legally enforceable declaration of what people want done with their probate property and their instructions about other matters when they die. A will does not take effect until the person's (testator's) death, and may be changed or revoked at any time until death. Thus, a will is referred to as being *ambulatory* until the maker's death. To be effective, a will must be executed in accordance with the legal requirements of the state for a valid will. It is important for both husband and wife to have valid wills for a complete estate plan.

## **Steps in Estate Settlement**

What does a deceased's personal representative (executor under a will or administrator of a person dying intestate) do in settling the estate? After the executor's or administrator's appointment, the following basic functions are performed. The time required to settle an estate can vary greatly—from a year or less to many years.

- N Assembling the property belonging to the estate (probate property).
- N Safekeeping, safeguarding, and insuring estate property during estate administration.
- N Temporary management of estate property.

4Note that this is not the same as a spouse's right to elect to take against the will. In that case, there is a valid will.

- N Payment of estate debts, expenses, and taxes. A will normally contains a *tax clause* indicating what interest or interests will bear death taxes.
- N Accounting for the estate administration.
- N Making distribution of the net estate to the proper heirs.

For performing these functions, the executor is entitled to reasonable compensation, which is deducted from the estate. Sometimes, individual executors will consider waiving this compensation, as explained next.

#### **Selecting the Executor or Coexecutors**

An executor can be an individual (e.g., the testator's spouse, brother or sister, an adult son or daughter, a trusted friend, etc.), a professional executor (e.g., a bank or trust company or an attorney), or coexecutors (such as the testator's spouse and a bank). An estate owner may consider naming an individual executor or executors, who also may be family members and heirs under the will. However, an executor's duties can be complex, time-consuming, and technical, and the executor can be held personally liable for mistakes or omissions. Therefore, many people decide to name a professional executor or a professional executor and one or more family members as coexecutors and pay the fee involved. Executors' fees are deductible from any federal estate tax due or on the decedent's final income tax return, whichever the executor elects.

When an individual (e.g., a family member) is named executor or coexecutor with a professional executor, he or she may consider waiving his or her executor's commission if the individual is an heir under the will anyway. Any commission will be ordinary income to the individual, but will be deductible by the estate. However, the individual executor may not be the only heir under the will. While this decision depends on the circumstances, it would seem an individual executor should think carefully before waiving his or her executor's commissions.

An executor normally has an attorney to provide advice regarding administering and settling the estate. The attorney's fees are charged to and may be deductible by the estate or on the income tax return. The attorney for the estate generally is considered to represent the executor and not the heirs under the will. Thus, under some circumstances, heirs may need to secure their own legal counsel.

## **Trusts in Estate Planning**

The famous jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, "Don't put your trust in money; put your money in trust." Trusts have an important place in tax and estate planning. We have already been introduced to the income taxation of trusts in Chapter 10. As noted, a trust is a fiduciary arrangement5 set up by someone, called the *grantor, creator,* or *settlor* of the trust, whereby a person, corporation, or organization, called the *trustee,* has legal title to property placed in the trust by the grantor. The trustee holds and manages this property, which technically is called the trust *corpus* or *principal,* for the benefit of someone, called the *beneficiary* of the trust. The beneficiary has equitable title to the trust property.

#### **Kinds of Trusts**

There are various kinds of trusts, but as far as how and when they are created are concerned, the most important are living (*inter vivos*) trusts, trusts under will (testamentary trusts), and insurance trusts. A *living trust* is created during the grantor's lifetime to benefit the grantor or someone else. The terms of a living trust are contained in a deed of trust executed during the grantor's lifetime. A *testamentary trust* is created under a person's will that, like the will, does not become effective until the grantor's death. The terms of a testamentary trust are part of the grantor's will. An *insurance trust* is a particular kind of living trust whose corpus consists partly or wholly of life insurance policies during the insured's lifetime and life insurance proceeds after the insured's death.

Living trusts can be revocable or irrevocable. A *revocable trust* is one in which the grantor reserves the right to revoke or amend the trust. In an *irrevocable trust,* the creator does not reserve the right to revoke or alter it. Most trusts are created by one person as grantor. In some cases, however, two or more persons will create *joint trusts.*

#### **Reasons for Creating Trusts**

Trusts have become important in financial and estate planning. Some of the common reasons or purposes for the trusts are as follows:

- N To allow the trustee to use his, her, or its discretion (as a fiduciary) in handling trust property for the benefit of the creator, his or her family, or others within the terms of the trust.
- N To provide a vehicle for holding family wealth as it passes from one generation to the next and perhaps over a number of generations.
- N To protect the creator's family or dependents against demands and entreaties from well-meaning, or perhaps not so well-meaning, family members, friends, spouses, ex-spouses, spouses-to-be, and the like.

5A fiduciary is an individual or corporation that acts in good faith for the benefit of another with respect to things falling within the scope of the fiduciary relationship.

- N To provide a way for giving or leaving property to minors so that the trustee can manage it for them until they are old enough to handle the property themselves.
- N In some cases, to protect trust beneficiaries from themselves when they are physically, mentally, or emotionally unable to manage property.
- N Trusts also can protect beneficiaries from their creditors. If an irrevocable trust contains a spendthrift clause that normally prohibits the beneficiary from alienating, assigning, or encumbering trust assets, the beneficiary's creditors generally can have no claim against trust assets. Correspondingly, trust assets can remain free from marital claims by present or future spouses of trust beneficiaries as gift property. These can be important reasons for giving property in trust rather than outright.
- N As a corollary to the previous two reasons, creators sometimes include conditions or requirements in trust documents, especially for longer-term trusts, that are intended to produce or encourage productive or socially useful behavior on the part of trust beneficiaries. These might include, for example, educational requirements, work requirements, matching trust distributions with the beneficiary's own earned income, pursuing socially useful (but perhaps lower-paid) occupations or activities, caring for other family members, distributions on marriage, and combinations of these or others. Such provisions are intended to try to avoid having the trust itself allow beneficiaries simply to live off the trust and do nothing productive with their lives. Trusts with such provisions are often called *incentive trusts.*
- N To create *special-needs trusts* for beneficiaries with disabilities who need to maintain eligibility for various government benefits, like Medicaid (see Chapter 23). Special-needs trusts limit the use of their assets and income to supplemental needs of the beneficiary that are not covered by government programs and that are not primary care, so the beneficiary will not be disqualified from receiving government benefits.
- N To provide professional investment and property management for other beneficiaries or for the creator himself or herself during his or her lifetime. Investment diversification also can be provided through mutual funds under the prudent investor rule.
- N To manage a business interest after the owner's death until it can be sold or one of his or her heirs can take over.
- N To provide a vehicle for setting up tax-saving plans.
- N As a recent development, in some states, grantors can protect themselves from their own future creditors by placing assets in irrevocable trusts created in those states. When established in one of the states permitting them in the United States, they are commonly called *asset protection trusts (APTs)*

or "onshore trusts." When established in a foreign country (some of which tailor their laws to attract such business), they often are called *offshore asset protection trusts (OAPTs).* Such creditor protection from the grantor's own creditors is discussed further in the material on dynasty trusts.

#### **Trustees' Fees**

Trustees, like executors, may receive compensation for their work. The fees charged by professional trustees vary; however, they usually are based on the value of the trust corpus, with a minimum annual fee. Trustees also may charge payout commissions on principal distributed from a trust. The following is an example of an annual commission schedule for personal trusts.

| Account Value Trust     | Managed Account<br>Individually | Managed Account<br>100% Invested in<br>Trustees' Own |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Corpus                  | Managed Portfolio               | Mutual Funds*                                        |
| First \$500,000         | .90%                            | .55%                                                 |
| \$500,001–\$1,000,000   | .90%                            | .45%                                                 |
| \$1,000,001–\$2,000,000 | .70%                            | .35%                                                 |
| \$2,000,001–\$4,000,000 | .60%                            | .25%                                                 |
| Over \$4,000,000        | .50%                            | .25%                                                 |
| Minimum Annual Fee      | \$3,000                         | \$1,500                                              |

\*Investment of trust assets in mutual funds now is permitted because the Uniform Prudent Investor Act or rule allows trustees to prudently delegate trust investment activities. The percentage fee is reduced because there also is a charge for investment management included in the mutual fund's expense ratio (see Chapter 8 and further in this chapter).

Thus, if we assume an individually managed trust with \$500,000 of principal (corpus) and earnings of \$25,000 per year in investment income, the trustee's annual fee under this schedule would be \$4,500 (\$500,000 × .009). This equals 0.90 percent of the principal and 18 percent of the income.

#### **Who Should Be the Trustee and What Should the Trust's Situs Be?**

A trustee can be an individual, a corporation, or any other group or organization legally capable of owning property. There can be one trustee or two or more cotrustees. Cotrustees, for example, can be two or more individuals, or a corporate trustee and one or more individual trustees. The creator of a trust or a beneficiary of the trust can be a trustee, but care must be taken to avoid tax problems when the creator (or the creator's spouse) or a beneficiary is trustee or a cotrustee.

The selection of a trustee is an important decision, and the choice often boils down to an individual or a corporate trustee. An individual trustee (or trustees) may be the creator, a member of the family, a trusted friend, an attorney, or someone else. The creator may want to continue to administer the property as trustee, making investment decisions, for example. In this case, however, care must be taken in drafting the trust so that there are no unintended tax results. An individual trustee might decide not to charge any fee. It also can be argued that an individual trustee may be closer to the trust beneficiaries and, hence, more likely to be responsive to their needs than a corporate trustee. Finally, individual trustees can get professional help from attorneys, investment advisers, financial planners, and the like in administering the trust.

On the other hand, arguments can be made for the use of corporate trustees. Corporate trustees are professional money and property managers and, hence, can provide technical expertise in this area. Also, individual trustees may die, resign, or otherwise become incapacitated, while corporate trustees provide continuity of management. Correspondingly, corporate trustees are unbiased and independent of family pressures. Corporate trustees also are financially able to respond to damages in the event of trust mismanagement. Furthermore, if an individual trustee is given full discretionary powers over trust income or corpus and he or she is a trust beneficiary, the trustee may be considered the owner of the trust corpus for federal estate and income tax purposes. This would not be true of a corporate trustee. On the other hand, properly drafted powers for individual trustees or beneficiaries (such as being subject to an ascertainable standard) normally will not give rise to these tax problems. Finally, a corporate trustee can serve as cotrustee with one or more individual trustees, thus combining at least some of the advantages of both.

It also is possible to provide in a trust agreement that a corporate trustee can be removed and another independent corporate trustee substituted upon the demand of trust beneficiaries, the grantor, or someone else. Thus, if one corporate trustee (or another independent trustee) should prove unsatisfactory, a mechanism can be provided in the trust instrument to replace that trustee with another corporate (or other independent) trustee.

The *situs* of a trust generally is the state or country where it is located. The law of the trust situs normally governs its construction and administration. Most trusts are located in the state where the grantor lives (the grantor's domicile). However, there has been an increasing tendency to establish trusts or to move existing trusts to states or countries other than the grantor's home state to take advantage of more favorable laws in certain jurisdictions. Such laws may allow dynasty trusts (so-called "dynasty trust jurisdictions" that do not have a rule against perpetuities), have stronger creditor protection (often called "domestic APT jurisdictions"), and have no or low state income taxes or trust income.

#### **Achieving Flexibility or Changes in Irrevocable Trusts**

An irrevocable trust is one that normally cannot be revoked or amended by the grantor. However, it is possible to give others the power to change an irrevocable trust or its administration if circumstances make it desirable.

One approach is to provide for a *directed trust* which authorizes the trustee to follow the direction of an adviser in such matters as investment decision (investment advisers) or making trust distributions (distribution advisers). Another concept is to name someone who is not a trust beneficiary as a *trust protector* with powers to change the trust's terms. These powers can be limited, such as the power to make administrative changes, or broader, such as allowing the trust protector to make substantive changes in the provisions of the trust, replace the trustee or others, move the trust to another jurisdiction, terminate the trust, or other powers. Such powers can be conditioned on certain factual events, such as actual repeal of the federal estate tax or imposition of carryover basis, or can arise in the event of the grantor's disability. Of course, the grantor himself or herself could change the terms of a testamentary trust by changing his or her will, or change the terms of a revocable living trust, assuming the grantor remains legally competent to do so. State laws differ in their treatement of directed trusts and trust protectors.

Still another approach is to give an independent trustee broad powers to make changes. For example, a trust document could give such a trustee power to make distributions of trust assets to another trust for the beneficiaries, effectively terminating the existing trust. An independent trustee also could be given power to change the situs of a trust. A practical problem with such planning for flexibility, however, is who should be named trust protector or independent trustee with broad powers. This can be a difficult and perhaps delicate choice, since this person or institution might have a considerable impact on the results for the grantor's family or other beneficiaries.

#### **How Long Should Trusts Last?**

Some trusts are intended to be in place for only a relatively short duration, such as until a minor reaches a certain age, like 35 or 40. Other trusts are for the beneficiary's lifetime, providing a life interest or life estate. Recently, however, the concept has emerged in some states of creating trusts that have unlimited duration and theoretically can last forever. These are commonly called *dynasty trusts* or *unlimited duration generation-skipping trusts.*

#### **600 Part VIII. Estate Planning**

The old common law set a limit on the duration of trusts for public policy reasons. This is called the *rule against perpetuities.* It provides that an interest in property must vest (e.g., a trust must terminate) no later than the end of a period measured by a life or lives in being at the creation of the interest (the lives usually being the beneficiaries identified in the trust document) plus 21 years, plus the period of gestation. This common-law rule has been incorporated into the statutory law of some states. Thus, it still serves to limit the permissible duration of trusts established in those states.

In recent years, however, states have adopted the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (USRAP), promulgated in 1993. In these states, the maximum duration effectively is the longer of the traditional limit or 90 years, with the ability to reform interests that do not comply with this rule.

The most dramatic development in this area, however, has been that states have recently amended their statutes generally to permit trusts created in those states to have unlimited duration (to be *dynasty trusts*). They have effectively repealed the rule against perpetuities in whole or in part and, in essence, allow trusts to last forever. Some of these states also exempt trusts from state income and capital gains taxation. Also, some of them give trust assets that may be used for the grantor's benefit creditor protection against claims by the grantor's own future creditors. The nature of this protection against the grantor's own creditors varies somewhat among these states and, depending on state law, does not apply in certain situations. Dynasty trusts also may avoid all future estate taxes and GST taxes since the trust never terminates.6 They also can provide creditor protection against the beneficiaries' creditors and protection from marital claims against beneficiaries (i.e., can be creditor-proof and divorce-proof) for an unlimited time. These trusts sometimes are referred to as *family banks.*

On the other hand, others may argue that keeping property tied up in a trust indefinitely may not be a good idea. Future generations should be able to direct their own destinies, even at the cost of higher wealth-transfer taxes. Also, laws permitting dynasty trusts, and particularly those allowing protection against the grantor's own creditors, are quite new and have not yet been fully tested. These trusts also result in long-term trust administration and trustees' fees. Finally, due to the nature and complexity of dynasty trusts, they probably are mainly for wealthy families.

<sup>6</sup>There might, of course, be tax on the creation of the trust—a gift tax if created during the grantor's lifetime or an estate tax if created under the grantor's will. It may also be that the grantor has applied part or all of his or her GST tax exemption to the trust so it will be exempt from the GST tax in the future. If not, the GST tax may apply to taxable distributions. See Chapter 26 for an explanation of the GST tax.

#### **Investment of Trust Assets**

Trust instruments can direct how trust assets are to be invested. The grantor can put directions concerning investment policy in the terms of the trust, which the trustee generally must follow. However, trusts frequently give trustees investment discretion under the terms of the law of the state where the trust is to be administered.

**Uniform Prudent Investor Act** Many states have adopted the Uniform Prudent Investor Act or some modification of it, which was first promulgated in 1994. This law applies to trust investments. It adopts the *prudent investor rule,*<sup>7</sup> which holds that a trustee should make trust investments by exercising reasonable care, skill, and caution given the circumstances and objectives of the trust and considering the trust's investment portfolio as a whole. The act applies modern portfolio theory to trust investments, in that it is the overall risk/return relationships of the whole portfolio that must be evaluated rather than each asset class taken alone. No particular class (or classes) of investment by itself, is prohibited, but investment media are to be evaluated in terms of their relationship to the overall portfolio's risk structure (e.g., their degree of correlation with other assets in the portfolio).

The act generally requires diversification of investments, but there may be circumstances that will justify a lack of diversification. Trustees also are allowed to prudently delegate investment activities and so they can invest in properly selected mutual funds. As noted earlier, when trust institutions invest in their own mutual funds, they may charge lower trustees' fees because of the funds' own expense ratios. The Uniform Prudent Investor Act generally applies, unless the grantor provides otherwise in the trust instrument.

**Total Return Trusts** Normally when a trust specifies that income may or must be paid to a beneficiary, the income means interest, dividends, rents or other income from trust assets, but it does not include realized capital gains (unless the trust terms so provide) or distributions from principal (corpus). The practical problem with this system is that over the years, dividend yields on common stocks have declined substantially. Thus, if a trust is invested for greatest reasonable total returns (e.g., with a substantial asset allocation to common stocks), the annual income to an income beneficiary will suffer, and this beneficiary will be unhappy. On the other hand, if the trust is invested primarily for income (e.g., mainly in bonds), principal (corpus) growth will be inhibited and the remainderperson will be equally unhappy.

<sup>7</sup>The prudent investor rule was first announced in 1992 in Section 227 of the American Law Institute's *Restatement (Third) of Trusts.*

It is argued that the solution to this dilemma is the *total return trust,* in which a part of the annual payment to an income beneficiary may consist of principal. This allows the trustee to invest for total returns without being unfair to either group of beneficiaries. To help accomplish this, one approach has been to enact legislation granting trustees the discretionary power to adjust distributions by transferring principal to an income beneficiary (or the reverse—income to principal) to the extent the trustee believes is needed for equity among income and remainder beneficiaries. This *power to adjust* ("equitable adjustment") concept was adopted in the 1997 revision of the Uniform Principal and Income Act, which, as of this writing, has been adopted in many of the states.

Another approach is legislation allowing trustees to convert *an income providing trust to a unitrust.* Such a unitrust requires or permits a trustee to distribute a fixed percentage (between 3 and 5 percent) of the current trust corpus (recalculated each year) to the current income beneficiary. The IRS has ruled that such "equitable adjustment trusts and unitrusts" under these laws providing unitrust payments of between 3 and 5 percent meet the requirements for marital deduction and certain GST trusts.
