# **Education Planning 12**

*Competence Objectives for This Chapter* After reading this chapter, planners should understand:

- N The nature and estimation of education costs
- N Financial aid for education arrangements
- N Income tax credits and deductions for education costs
- N Strategies in planning for education costs
- N Qualified Tuition Programs (Section 529 plans)
- N Coverdell Education Savings Accounts
- N Other arrangements for advance funding of education

This chapter deals with the various ways for financing the increasingly important and growing cost of education. Several of these ways have become increasingly attractive since passage of EGTRRA in 2001 and PPA in 2006.

## **Importance as a Financial Objective**

Financing education expenses is a growing and important financial objective for many people. There are many reasons for this. Education costs are high and generally are rising faster than the rate of inflation. More people are attending colleges and universities, graduate schools, and other educational programs. Education costs are reasonably predictable, although what a particular person will do regarding his or her education is far from certain. Many plans are available for dealing in advance with education costs. Finally, education costs can create considerable strain on a family's financial situation, perhaps at the very time other significant financial needs are emerging.

## **Nature and Growth of Education Costs**

The amount of education costs naturally depends on the circumstances. These include, among other things:

- N The type of program involved—for example, undergraduate programs in colleges and universities, graduate schools (medicine, dental, law, graduate business, and so forth), community colleges, and technical and other schools
- N How many years are involved
- N Whether the person is a resident or nonresident student
- N Whether it is a public or private school (for colleges)
- N What scholarships and other financial aid are available
- N Whether the student will be working and contributing to the cost while in school (during the summer or in co-op programs, for example)
- N How many children or others are involved

For college and graduate school, the types of expenses can include tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation, and other incidental expenses. These typically are considerably higher for private colleges than for public institutions. Depending on family circumstances and desires, education expenses also may include costs of private secondary schools and other private programs.

College and graduate school costs have been growing for many years. Their rate of growth has varied over the years, and it has been more rapid for private schools than for public ones, but as a rule of thumb for planning purposes, one probably can set the rate of growth somewhere between 4 and 5.5 percent.

# **Estimating Education Costs**

This necessarily involves many unknowns and assumptions, and so general approximations of expected costs are in order. To even roughly estimate future costs and funding needs, one should make assumptions as to (1) the type of program planned for, its length in years, and its current net cost per year; (2) an estimated average annual compound rate of growth in costs; (3) the number of years until the program starts; and (4) an estimated average annual compound after-tax rate of return on assets set aside for education funding. Financial institutions, financial planning software, and other sources have systems for estimating education costs given certain input data.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Just as an example of the principles involved, assume David and Mary Smith (both age 35 and working outside the home) have a child age 1, Hortense, who they hope will enter college in 17 years. At present, they would like to begin to prepare financially for a four-year undergraduate program for Hortense as a resident student at a private university. Assume typical annual expenses for full-time resident undergraduates at private colleges and universities are about \$33,000 (although they could go as high as \$50,000 or more at some private schools). Corresponding typical annual expenses for public colleges and universities are about \$13,000. Therefore, in 17 years, David and Mary will need about \$132,000 (4 × \$33,000 per year) for Hortense in terms of current education costs. If they assume private undergraduate college costs will increase at a 5 percent average annual compound rate over the 17 years, this need becomes \$302,546 in 17 years (or \$132,000 present value at 5% average annual compound rate of increase for 17 years).1 Further assuming that an investment funding for education expenses would have an after-tax or taxfree average annual compound rate of total return of 6 percent (assuming, for example, use of a Section 529 plan, which would be tax free), the Smith's would need to invest about \$10,724 per year to reach their goal of about \$302,546 in 17 years (or the annual payment at 6% average annual compound rate of return to reach \$302,546 in 17 years).

Different assumptions, of course, might be made. For example, if it is assumed that Hortense will work in the summers (or perhaps have a work-study program while in college) and perhaps will earn, say, \$5,000 after taxes per year in current dollars (or \$20,000 for four years), the \$132,000 goal could be reduced to \$112,000 (both in current dollars) for planning purposes. Scholarships or other aid also might be assumed, but this is a bit of a stretch at age 1. Finally, costs will be increased dramatically if graduate school education is assumed.

## **Financial Aid Considerations**

Many students attending colleges, universities, and other schools receive various forms of financial aid. These aid packages may include low-interest loans, grants and scholarships, and earnings from work-study programs.

Eligibility for need-based financial aid under standardized formulas depends on the student's and his or her parents' incomes and assets, and

<sup>1</sup>This figure can be determined on a handheld calculator, on a computer, or by using the future value of a sum table. See Chapter 3.

perhaps other factors (such as the number of children in school). Generally, a student's "need" for federal purposes is the difference between the cost of attendance at the educational institution and the student's expected family contribution (EFC). The EFC is what the student and his or her parents are expected to pay for the student's education under standardized formulas.2

Grants or scholarships (gift aid) genarally are based on need and do not have to be paid back. Some examples are the federal Pell Grants to students and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOGs) made to colleges, which then provide grants to students. There also may be state and state-federal grants, Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) scholarships, and other grants.

Loans might include low-interest or subsidized loans, such as federal programs for Perkins loans and subsidized Stafford loans. These are need-based loan programs. Other loans may not be need based, such as unsubsidized Stafford loans, Parents' Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), and various private loan programs. There also may be earnings from work-study programs. In addition to need-based financial aid, there can be merit aid not based on financial need.

## **Tax "Breaks" for Education Costs**

#### **Federal Income Tax Credits**

These include the *Hope Scholarship credit* and the *Lifetime Learning credit.* The Hope credit is for college tuition (reduced by any scholarship and fellowship grants excluded from income) and certain fees incurred by the taxpayer, his or her spouse, and a qualified dependent of the taxpayer for each of the first two years of college [for four years from 2009 and 2010 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)]. It also applies to tuition for a vocational school leading to a recognized post-secondary school degree or credential. The credit applies to each student in a taxpayer's family. For each student, the credit is 100 percent of the first \$1,200 (indexed) and 50 percent of the next \$1,200 (indexed) in qualified tuition and fees per year (with increased limits for 2009 and 2010 under ARRA). Eligible students must be enrolled at least on a half-time basis.

<sup>2</sup>For example, the EFC (based on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid) includes up to 50 percent of the student's income (minus certain allowances), 35 percent of the student's assets, up to 47 percent of the parents' income (minus certain allowances), and 5.6 percent of the parents' assets. However, equity in the parents' home and their retirement assets are excluded from the EFC.

#### **Education Planning 287**

The Lifetime Learning credit is for tuition and fees for undergraduate and graduate college and university courses, as well as for courses at eligible institutions to acquire and improve job skills incurred by the taxpayer, his or her spouse, and a qualified dependent of the taxpayer. This credit applies only once per year per taxpayer, but can be taken for an unlimited number of years and a student can be enrolled on less than a half-time basis. For each tax return per year, the credit is 20 percent of up to \$10,000 of qualified tuition and fees.

Both the Hope Scholarship credit and the Lifetime Learning credit cannot be taken for the same student in a given year. However, each is available for a year in which tax-free distributions are made from a state qualified tuition program (QTP) or an Education Savings Account (Coverdell IRA) for the same student, as long as they do not cover the same eligible expenses. Each of these credits are phased out for higher income taxpayers.

#### **Federal Income Tax Deductions**

**Student Loan Interest Deduction** A deduction from gross income to arrive at adjusted gross income (i.e., "above the line") is allowed for interest paid on "qualified education loans." The maximum annual deduction is \$2,500 and it is available for the entire duration of the loan. However, this deduction is phased out for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes (AGIs) over certain limits.

**Deduction for Higher Education Expenses** There also is a deduction above the line for "qualified higher education expenses" (defined as the Hope credit discussed previously) up to \$4,000 for taxpayers whose AGI does not exceed certain amounts.

This deduction cannot be taken in the same year as the Hope or Lifetime Learning credit for the same student. Also, no deduction can be taken for expenses that are used for amounts excludable from income due to distributions from an Education Savings Account or a QTP, or due to excludable interest from a U.S. savings bond.

**Exclusions from Income, Gift, or Penalty Taxes for Federal Tax Purposes** There are a variety of situations in which amounts used for eligible education expenses are excluded from a taxpayer's gross income (i.e., are tax free or have other tax advantages).

- N Earnings from qualified tuition programs, as discussed later in this chapter.
- N Earnings from Education Savings Accounts, as discussed later in this chapter.
- N Interest on certain U.S. savings bonds are noted in Chapter 7.
- N Amounts up to \$5,250 per employee, per year, from employer-provided education assistance plans, as noted in Chapter 11.

- N Amounts of scholarships and fellowship grants given to degree candidates at an educational institution and used for tuition, related fees, books, and supplies and equipment normally are excluded from the recipient's gross income. However, amounts used for room and board and other personal items, as well as amounts received for required services (e.g., teaching or researching as a condition of the grant) are not excluded.
- N Distributions from regular IRAs before age 59½ for eligible education expenses are not subject to the 10 percent penalty tax on premature distributions, but such distributions are still taxed as ordinary income (i.e., they are not income tax–free), as explained in Chapter 15.
- N An unlimited gift tax exclusion for payments of tuition directly to an educational organization, as explained in Chapter 27.

# **Strategies in Planning for Education Costs Rely on Financial Aid and Tax Breaks**

It will be good if these things materialize, but it does not seem prudent to rely primarily on them, particularly when the potential student is relatively young. Scholarships and grants are uncertain.

Some work-study may be fine for many students, and in some cases may even improve their performance by making them more responsible. Some schools have co-op programs involving full-time study for part of the year and full-time work for another part. Furthermore, students often have summer jobs or internships when they are not in school. All of this will be helpful in financing their educations, but too much work while in school will dilute the educational experience and may put undue pressure on students. However, it seems entirely reasonable to assume a student can earn some part of his or her education expenses with perhaps limited work-study and certainly through summer employment. This can be considered when estimating education costs, as illustrated earlier in this chapter. Loans as a part of financial aid are considered in the next section.

Tax "breaks" are always nice, but as a practiced matter, they can only be a partial answer. They generally are limited in amount, are subject to income eligibility requirements, or are otherwise limited. The most significant tax advantages in planning for education expenses would seem to be the exclusion from income of earnings from qualified tuition programs and Education IRAs when used for eligible education expenses, as explained later.

### **Rely Primarily on Borrowing**

This has become an increasingly important strategy in recent years. The vast majority of loans (about 95 percent) come from federally supported programs. However, there also are a number of private loan programs specifically for college expenses. Finally, there are the normal sources of loans for any purpose, such as mortgage refinancing, home equity loans, life insurance policy loans, loans from qualified retirement plans, and other sources.

The basic problem with borrowing is that the loans plus interest (even at favorable rates) must be paid back. Today, graduates commonly leave school burdened with student loans. Parents may find themselves in debt to finance their children's education at the very time they should be building capital for their own retirement. For the same reason, borrowing from retirement plan account balances may be self-defeating. Thus, while borrowing may be necessary if no advance preparation has been made, it normally is not the preferred solution.

# **Advance Funding for Education Costs**

This approach has received increasing attention recently, particularly with the attractive education incentives contained in EGTRRA which have been made permanent by the PPA of 2006. In the opinion of the authors, it is the preferred primary strategy. A number of plans are available for funding education costs. Some are designed specifically for that purpose, while others are more general in nature. However, they all require time to be effective, so it is a good idea to start saving early.

## **Factors Affecting Choice of Plans**

There can be many factors to consider when evaluating these plans. Some obviously are more important than others. A combination of plans can also be used. These factors include:

- N Nature of the plan and how to set it up
- N Eligibility requirements, income ceilings, and limits on contributions
- N Kinds of educational expenses that can be funded
- N Tax treatment of plan contributions
- N Income tax treatment of plan earnings
- N Income tax treatment of distributions from the plan
- N Federal estate tax, GST tax, and possibly state death tax status of plan balances on death of the plan owner or beneficiary
- N Forms in which contributions can be made
- N Investment options and flexibility allowed by the plan
- N Fees and expenses of the plan
- N Ability to make changes in the plan
- N Protecting the plan in the event of the death or disability of the contributor before the plan is completed

- N Coordination with other plans, scholarships, and tax "breaks"
- N Possible creditor protection
- N Possible "freezing" of future education costs

## **Qualified Tuition Programs (Section 529 Plans)3**

These are state programs that may be 529 saving accounts (or saving account programs) or prepaid tuition programs (also called tuition credit or tuition certificate programs).4 They are both referred to as QTPs or 529 plans, but by far, the more popular are saving account programs.

**General Characteristics** Prepaid tuition programs are state-operated trusts to which U.S. citizens5 can make cash contributions that are applied to purchase credits or certificates for a designated beneficiary for tuition and fees for a given number of academic periods or course units at the current tuition rates. The investment of prepaid tuition funds normally is handled by the state, and some states do not guarantee the arrangement. Usually, if a student attends a private college or university or an out-of-state school, the funds accumulated in the plan still can be used for eligible higher education expenses, except the amount of covered expenses may be limited (such as to in-state tuition) and there is no locking in of current tuition rates.

Savings account programs are state-operated plans to which U.S. citizens can make cash contributions that are accumulated in accounts owned by the contributor and for payment of qualified higher education expenses of a designated beneficiary. While these programs are state plans, they usually are administered and the account balances invested by private financial intermediaries. Most of the remainder of this discussion deals with savings account programs.

QTPs must comply with Section 529 of the IRC and corresponding tax rules to get the substantial benefits afforded under federal tax law. However, they also are creatures of the individual states, and so contributions must comply with the rules of the particular state plan as well. Thus, both federal and individual state rules must be considered when contributing to Section 529 plans.

<sup>5</sup> Sometimes these programs are limited to state residents.

<sup>3</sup> Section 529 was added to the IRC by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 and has been amended and expanded several times since. A significant expansion was made by EGTRRA, and this expansion was made permanent (i.e., no "sunset") by the PPA of 2006. 4Under EGTRRA, prepaid tuition programs (but not savings account plans) can be established and maintained by eligible private institutions (e.g., colleges and universities) that meet the requirements of Section 529 of the IRC.

**Eligibility and Limits on Contributions** With the exception of a few plans that have state residency requirements, QTP accounts can be set up by any U.S. citizen for any beneficiary, with no residency requirement or income ceilings on the person's ability to establish or contribute to the plan. Thus, persons desiring to set up 529 plans should "shop around" among state plans to find the most attractive one or ones for them. State plans differ in a number of respects, and a potential contributor may want to consider the following factors, among others, in his or her selection:

- N State income tax (if any) treatment of contributions and qualified distributions (in the case of contributors who are state residents)
- N Available investment options
- N Who the investment manager is
- N Fees charged, particularly the annual expense ratio on the investment options
- N Whether the plan is as flexible as Section 529 allows with respect to rollovers to other plans, changes of designated beneficiary, and perhaps other matters
- N Maximum contributions (or account values) allowed
- N Higher education expenses and schools covered
- N Possible state creditor protection. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 exempts those education accounts from creditors' claims under federal bankruptcy law with some conditions.

Section 529 requires that a QTP take measures to prevent contributions beyond those reasonably necessary to pay for a beneficiary's qualified higher education expenses. Therefore, the plans set maximum limits on the aggregate lifetime contributions (or sometimes account values) that can be made for a single designated beneficiary in the state.6 These maximums vary by state and may range from around \$100,000 to over \$280,000. Sometimes, they vary with the age of the designated beneficiary.

**Qualified Higher Education Expenses** In essence, these expenses can be paid tax free from QTPs. They include tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment for the attendance of a designated beneficiary at an eligible educational institution. They also include room and board for a designated beneficiary who is enrolled in a program leading to a degree or a recognized educational credential and carrying at least half the normal full-time workload for the program involved.7

<sup>6</sup>The states often determine this maximum limit by taking four or five years of eligible expenses at the most expensive school in the state. This maximum may increase periodically with increased education costs.

<sup>7</sup>Prepaid tuition programs may not include room and board.

An eligible educational institution includes any accredited post-secondary educational institution offering credit toward bachelor's, associate's, graduate, or professional degrees and includes certain vocational institutions. Such an institution must be eligible to participate in the Department of Education's student aid programs.

**Tax Treatment of Contributions** Contributions to a QTP are not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Depending on state law, they may be deductible up to a limit for state income tax purposes for residents of the state.

With respect to federal gift taxation, contributions are considered completed gifts of a present interest from the account owner to the designated beneficiary. Thus, in 2009, contributions qualify for the \$13,000 per donee annual exclusion for both gift tax and GST tax purposes.

Furthermore, to encourage early funding, Section 529 allows so-called front-loading for annual exclusion purposes. This means an account owner can elect to treat a single year's gift that exceeds the annual exclusion for that year as if were made pro rata over five years for the purpose of applying the annual exclusions for those years. Thus, one person could give up to \$65,000 (\$13,000 annual exclusion × 5) and a married person with gift splitting could give up to \$130,000 (\$65,000 for each spouse) for one designated beneficiary in a single year.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose Gary, who is married to Susan, wants to start a QTP, with his granddaughter, Traci, as designated beneficiary. Gary has a substantial estate and would like to make as large an initial contribution as possible to take advantage of tax-free compounding and still stay within the gift tax and GST tax (since Traci would be a skip person to Gary) annual exclusions. Assuming Susan is willing to split the gifts, he could contribute \$130,000 to the QTP in the first year and make the five-year election just described (assuming this is within the state's maximum limit). Then, he would be treated as having made a \$26,000 gift in the first year and in each of the next four years (i.e., over five years). With gift splitting, this would be considered an annual gift of \$13,000 each by Gary and Susan and within the annual exclusions of each.

**Tax Treatment of Plan Earnings** The earnings from the assets in a QTP are not currently taxed for federal income tax purposes. They also will not be taxed upon distribution if they are used to pay for qualified higher education expenses (i.e., a qualified distribution). Otherwise, they will be taxed as ordinary income upon distribution.

**Tax Treatment of Plan Distributions** As just stated, plan withdrawals used for qualified higher education expenses of the designated beneficiary are not gross income, for federal income tax purposes, to the designated beneficiary or account owner. This means the investment earnings on plan assets are never taxed when so used. Depending on state law, they also may be exempt from any state income tax.

To be exempt from federal income taxation, the distributions must be made in one of the following ways: (1) distributed directly to an eligible educational institution; (2) distributed by a check payable to both the designated beneficiary and an eligible educational institution; (3) distributed as reimbursement to the designated beneficiary for qualified higher education expenses paid, with the beneficiary producing receipts; (4) distributed to the designated beneficiary, who certifies in writing that the distribution will be used for qualified higher education expenses within a reasonable time; or (5) distributed as necessary for a special-needs beneficiary at an eligible educational institution. Also, a qualified distribution must be taken in the same tax year as the qualified higher education expenses were paid.

In the case of withdrawals not used for qualified higher education expenses (nonqualified distributions), the earnings element will be taxable as ordinary income to the distributee. Thus, in effect, any part of the investment earnings that normally would be a long-term capital gain becomes ordinary income in a nonqualified distribution. Nonqualified distributions are taxed under the annuity rules of Section 72 of the IRC (see Chapter 16). To do so, first the earnings element in the account balance is determined by subtracting the investment element (the contributions to the plan) from the total account balance. Then, an earnings ratio is determined by dividing this earnings element at the end of the calendar year by the total account value at that time. The taxable portion of any nonqualified distribution is this earnings ratio times the total distribution.

Furthermore, there is an additional 10 percent federal penalty tax on any taxable (earnings) portion of a nonqualified distribution, with some exceptions. For example, the penalty tax does not apply when the nonqualified distribution is made to the beneficiary's estate after his or her death; is attributable to the beneficiary's disability; or is made on account of the beneficiary's receipt of a scholarship, allowance, or certain other payments to the extent the distribution does not exceed the scholarship, allowance, or payment. There also may be state penalties for nonqualified distributions.

**Federal Estate, GST, and Gift Tax Status of Plan Balances** The balance in a QTP is not included in a deceased account owner's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. The only exception is if the account owner elected for five-year annual exclusion treatment and dies within the five-year period. In this case, the remaining pro rata amounts would be in the decedent's gross estate. For example, suppose Mary Eduski, who is unmarried, contributed \$65,000 to a 529 savings account in 2009, with her nephew as designated beneficiary, and elected to treat it as if made pro rata over five years. Furthermore, suppose Mary dies in 2011. In this case, \$26,000 (for 2012 and 2013) would be in her gross estate.

Interestingly, this exclusion from the account owner's gross estate applies even though the account owner can direct how and when distributions are to be made to the designated beneficiary (normally for qualified higher education expenses, but perhaps not), can change the designated beneficiary, and can even recover the savings account balance for himself or herself.8 This is the only financial and estate planning vehicle that allows such flexibility and tax advantages in making lifetime transfers without gift, GST, or estate tax consequences. This can make 529 plans a powerful estate planning tool, as illustrated next.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that Michael Edgalia, age 70, is a widower with a substantial estate and an annual income in the top income tax bracket. He has three adult children and nine minor grandchildren. Michael himself never went to college, but he believes in education and wants to provide all the educational opportunities that his grandchildren want. Michael already is making direct annual exclusion gifts each year to his children. He also has paid tuition for several of his grandchildren directly to certain preschool programs and private elementary and secondary schools, all of which are free of federal gift tax.

Now in 2009, Michael decides to open 529 saving accounts in a carefully selected state QTP, with each of his grandchildren as a designated beneficiary of one of the accounts. Michael is the owner of all the accounts. He decides to contribute \$65,000 to each 529 account and elect the five-year annual exclusion treatment. This means his gift will be within the federal gift tax annual exclusion for the current year and for each of the next four years for each grandchild, and also will be within the GST tax annual exclusion for each grandchild for each of those years (since each grandchild is a skip person to Michael). This gift also will be out

8These rights are subject to the rules of individual state plans. Therefore, it is important to check and evaluate state plans with regard to their flexibility in allowing such actions.

of Michael's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes, assuming he survives five years.

Thus, Michael effectively has moved more than a half million dollars (9 × \$65,000 = \$585,000) to his grandchildren without any transfer taxation and with no current income taxation on plan earnings, while retaining substantial control over the account as the owner. For example, he can direct how, when, and to what eligible institutions income tax–free distributions for qualified higher education expenses will be made for the designated beneficiaries. Michael also can change the designated beneficiary.9 Furthermore, an account owner—Michael in this example—normally can recover the funds in the 529 account for himself or herself for any reason. Such a refund to the account owner would be a nonqualified distribution, and thus the earnings portion will be subject to ordinary income tax and the 10 percent federal penalty tax. Even so, there still will be deferral of tax on the investment earnings until the nonqualified distribution is made. The real "price" to Michael of a nonqualified refund is the 10 percent penalty tax on the earnings and that all the earnings will be taxed as ordinary income, even though part or all of the account balance may be invested in capital gain–type assets (e.g., common stocks).

If a designated beneficiary dies, the 529 plan account balance will be included in the deceased beneficiary's gross estate. This is true, even though, in fact, beneficiaries have no control over these plans. However, designated beneficiaries normally will be considerably younger than account owners, and so this would not seem to be a major issue.

**Form of Contributions** Contributions to QTPs may be made only in cash. Thus, appreciated property cannot be placed in these plans.

**Flexibility in the Plan** The 529 plans offer considerable flexibility in their creation and operation. Generally, any adult U.S. citizen can open an account and be the account owner. There are no income limits on eligibility to participate. Furthermore, some states permit custodians of Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) accounts

<sup>9</sup>As will be covered later in this chapter, there are no tax consequences for a change of beneficiary, as long as the new beneficiary is a "member of the family" (as defined in the tax law) of the former beneficiary and is not in a younger generation from that of the former beneficiary.

to use cash in the account to open a 529 plan for the account beneficiary. In this case, the 529 plan will be subject to the state's UTMA or UGMA statute. However, this may involve liquidity UTMA or UEMA investments thus triggering capital gains tax. Some QTPs will allow trusts, partnerships (perhaps a family limited partnership [FLP]), corporations, or other entities to open 529 plans. The trustee of an existing trust, for example, might use cash in the trust to open a 529 plan, with the trust as the account owner and a trust beneficiary as the designated beneficiary. State plans permit the naming of a successor account owner in the event of the original owner's death. Also, some QTPs may permit naming a successor owner in the event of the original owner's incapacity.10

**Naming and Changing the Designated Beneficiary** The account owner can name and change the designated beneficiary. Any individual can be designated beneficiary, including the account owner.

If the account owner changes the designated beneficiary to an eligible "member of the family" of the former designated beneficiary, as defined in the tax law,11 it is not considered a nonqualified distribution and is not subject to income taxation. However, if the new beneficiary is not a "member of the family" of the former beneficiary, the change is treated as a nonqualified distribution of the account balance to the account owner and taxed accordingly.

In addition, if the account owner names a new beneficiary who is one or more generations younger than the former beneficiary (such as changing to a child of the former beneficiary), it is viewed in the proposed IRS regulations as a gift for federal gift tax purposes by the former beneficiary to the new beneficiary. It could also be a GST tax transfer by the former beneficiary to the new beneficiary, if the new beneficiary is two or more generations younger than the former beneficiary (such as changing to a grandchild of the former beneficiary). However, if the change is to someone in the same or an older generation than the former beneficiary, no adverse tax result occurs.

**Rollovers to Other Plans** QTPs normally allow an account owner to transfer (roll over) an account from one state plan to another state plan. In effect,

<sup>10</sup>The incapacity issue also can be handled by giving the agent under a durable general power of attorney authority to deal with the account.

<sup>11</sup>For this purpose, the tax law defines a "member of the family" as a child or the child's descendants; a stepchild; a brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister; the father, mother, or an ancestor of either; a stepfather or stepmother; a first cousin; a child of a brother or sister (i.e., a niece or nephew); a brother or sister of the father or mother (i.e., uncle or aunt); a son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law; or a spouse of the designated beneficiary or of any of the family members just named. This is a reasonably broad list of potential new beneficiaries.

this means changing the plan (including its investment selection) to a new account. The change to a new account also may be in the same state plan, depending on state plan rules. If the beneficiary is not changed, there can be only one rollover in any one 12-month period. However, if the beneficiary is changed, the account can be rolled over at any time.

**Investment Options and Investment Flexibility** One of the requirements of Section 529 is that neither the account owner nor the beneficiary may directly or indirectly oversee the investments in the 529 account. However, the seeming inflexibility of this requirement can be mitigated in practice in several respects. First, many state plans permit donors (account owners), upon initially opening an account, to select from a range of broad investment options and allocate his or her contributions among one or more of these options. The plans often offer so-called age-based asset allocation options, under which the allocation in the option among, say, common stock, bond, and money market funds automatically changes as the beneficiary gets older. These investment options (age-based and non-age-based) often are in mutual funds that are managed by outside investment intermediaries for the state.

Second, the ability to roll over an account to an account in another plan effectively allows account owners to change the investment selection for the new account. Assuming the beneficiary is not changed, such a rollover can be made once every 12 months. This would seem to give an account owner reasonable flexibility to change investment strategies, if desired, after an account has been opened. If the beneficiary is changed (subject to the tax rules explained earlier), a rollover can be made at any time.

Finally, the IRS permits account owners to change investment options twice per calendar year or upon a beneficiary change within the same plan. Some plans allow this by permitting transfers of existing account balances to other investment options within the same plan upon a beneficiary change. This allows investment flexibility without having to roll over an account to another state plan. Also, QTPs often allow the directing of future contributions to different investment options.

Thus, while 529 savings account owners cannot select individual securities or other assets for their accounts (as they could, for example, for Education IRAs and UTMA or UGMA accounts), they have a reasonably broad choice among mutual funds and perhaps guaranteed principal accounts, depending on the particular state plan. State plans vary in the number and nature of the investment options offered and in their investment performance. Therefore, among the important factors to consider when choosing a state QTP are the investment options offered; the flexibility allowed in changing the investment strategy of an existing account; the financial intermediary, if any, managing the investment funds; and the performance record and expense ratios of the various funds and plans.

A QTP cannot allow the assets in an account to serve as security for any loan.

**Fees and Expenses of the Plans** Here again, state plans vary widely in their costs. Sometimes costs are lower for state residents than nonresidents. There may be application fees, annual fees to cover program expenses, and fees for other services. However, perhaps most important are the annual asset-based investment fund fees, which are a percentage of the value of the assets in the account.12 These annual asset-based percentage charges are analogous to the expense ratios of mutual funds, and may vary with the investment choices made.13 They also vary widely among different QTPs.

**Coordination with Other Plans and Financial Aid Considerations** As noted earlier, a person can contribute to a 529 plan and an Education IRA for the same beneficiary in the same year. Of course, to avoid a taxable gift, the combined contributions must be within the gift tax annual exclusion for the beneficiary for the year.

When qualified higher education expenses are incurred, they are first reduced by any scholarship or fellowship grants excluded from gross income and any other tax-free education benefits received by the beneficiary. Then they are reduced by any expenses taken into account in determining the Hope or Lifetime Learning credit. The remaining qualified expenses then can be paid tax free from a 529 plan. They could also be paid tax free from an Education IRA. If there should be total distributions from both a 529 plan and an Education IRA that exceed such reduced expenses, the expenses are allocated between the distributions.

For purposes of federal student financial aid, a 529 plan is considered an asset of the account owner. Therefore, if the student is the account owner, it will be his or her asset; but if a parent is the account owner, it will be the parent's asset for determining the EFC. If a grandparent or other relative is the account owner, the 529 account itself should not affect financial aid considerations.

**Protecting the Plan in the Event of Death or Disability of Donor** Only life insurance and disability insurance can perform this function. Therefore, the need for coverage to meet future education costs in the event of a contributor's early death or disability should be considered in the insurance plan, as illustrated in Chapter 21.

<sup>12</sup>This may be a "wrap fee" that covers program expenses and investment fund fees in one annual asset-based percentage charge.

<sup>13</sup> In fact, the various investment options offered by QTPs usually are invested in one or more mutual funds.

**Possible "Freezing" of Future Education Costs** This can only be done through prepaid tuition plans.

**Education IRAs (Coverdell Education Savings Accounts)** These also are taxfavored plans to accumulate funds to pay for education expenses that were liberalized by EGTRRA and made permanent by PPA. See Chapter 15 for more information.

As compared to 529 plans, Education IRAs have some advantages, but also some drawbacks. Tax-free distributions from Education IRAs can be used not only for qualified higher education expenses (as is true for 529 plans), but also for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses for grades K through 12 (which are not covered by 529 plans). Thus, in the case of beneficiaries for whom elementary and secondary education expenses may be incurred (e.g., attending private schools), an eligible contributor may want to consider an Education IRA to fund those expenses in a tax-free basis. This may be in addition to a 529 plan, which could be used for qualified higher education expenses. Furthermore, Education IRA account owners have greater investment latitude than with 529 plans. Finally, Education IRAs are not subject to individual state plan rules, as are 529 plans.

On the other hand, a major drawback for Education IRAs is the \$2,000 annual limit per beneficiary that a person can contribute. Up to \$13,000 (in 2009) gift tax–free per beneficiary–donee per year can be placed in a 529 plan, and contributions can be "front-loaded" for five years. Another drawback is the income limit on eligibility to contribute to Education IRAs. The required rollover or distribution when a beneficiary reaches age 30 is another constraining factor. There are no such distribution requirements for 529 plans. Finally, a significant advantage for most 529 plans, which is not available for any other plan, is the ability of the account owner to recover (withdraw) the account balance at any time for himself or herself. The only "cost" of such recovery is paying tax at ordinary income rates plus a 10 percent federal penalty tax on the earnings portion of such a withdrawal. This provides unusual financial planning latitude for 529 plan account owners.

## **Other Arrangements for Advance Funding**

Other approaches can be used for funding education costs that are not specifically designed for that purpose. These are described in other chapters and so will only be briefly noted here.

**Uniform Transfers and Uniform Gifts to Minors Acts** These custodianships are discussed in Chapter 27. A custodian under these plans can make payments for the beneficiary's education expenses or can make distributions to the beneficiary, which he or she can then use for that purpose. Of course, payments for the benefit of and distributions to the beneficiary can be made for other purposes as well.

The advantages of these custodianships are that contributions to them can be made in kind (e.g., appreciated securities), so any capital gains can be taxed to the minor; the custodian has wide investment latitude; and the assets can be used for or by the minor (or adult at age 21) for any purpose (e.g., travel, buying a home, or starting a business). On the other hand, the earnings on the assets in the account will be taxed currently to the minor. They are not tax free, unless invested in municipal bonds or funds. Also, the account must go outright to the minor at the statutory age (usually 21) and then will be subject to the beneficiary's absolute control. Even if the custodian invests UTMA or UGMA funds in a Section 529 plan, the beneficiary will get control of the 529 account at the statutory age. And, of course, the original donor can never get the funds back.

**Trusts for Minors** These also are discussed in Chapter 27. The trustee can be given authority to use trust assets for educational expenses of trust beneficiaries, as well as for other purposes.

The advantages are that contributions can be made in kind; the trustee can be given broad investment powers; and trust assets can be used for or by the trust beneficiaries for any purpose, subject to the terms of the trust. On the other hand, the earnings on trust assets will be taxed currently to the trust if accumulated or to the beneficiary(ies) if paid out currently to them. Either way, the investment earnings are not tax free, unless trust assets are invested in municipal securities. Also, in the case of Section 2503(c) trusts, the assets must go outright to the beneficiary at age 21, unless the beneficiary consents to their remaining in trust. And, of course, the original grantor can never recover the trust assets for himself or herself if they are to be excluded from the grantor's gross estate and the income not taxed to the grantor.

As noted earlier, some QTPs allow trustees to open 529 plans for trust beneficiaries with cash from the trust. In this case, the trust is the account owner and a trust beneficiary is the designated beneficiary. The trustee then can direct qualified distributions for the beneficiary, change the beneficiary to another trust beneficiary, or direct a withdrawal (recovery) back into the trust corpus. A trustee has a fiduciary duty to the trust beneficiaries to impartially and properly administer the trust, and so there may be advantages to the beneficiaries in having a trust as owner of a 529 account. It also may be an attractive, tax-free (for qualified higher education expenses) investment of trust assets. On the other hand, since only cash can be contributed to a 529 plan, if the trustee must sell appreciated assets to raise the cash, this will result in capital gains for the trust. This same caveat can also be made for 529 plans held in UTMA or UGMA accounts.

**United States Savings Bonds Redeemed for Education Expenses** This was explained in Chapter 7 in the description of U.S. savings bonds. While this exclusion of interest may be helpful in some cases, it generally cannot be counted on as a complete advance funding technique in itself.

**Cash-Value Life Insurance** These policies normally cover a parent as the insured and the owner. They are intended to accumulate a cash value, which can be used for education expenses (usually through policy loans or withdrawals less than basis) if the insured survives, but if the insured should die or become disabled before the education is begun or completed, the death proceeds (or waiver of premium benefit) are there to complete the education plan. This approach effectively utilizes the income tax advantages of life insurance, as explained in Chapter 29. It also could be owned by an irrevocable life insurance trust for estate tax reasons if desired.

**Use of Individually Owned Assets or Savings** For many years, people simply have saved or accumulated assets—either separately in their own names or jointly with their spouses—in anticipation of using those assets to pay for their children's education. This certainly is a simple and flexible approach, and has certain advantages. The owner controls the assets and their use. If the education plans do not materialize or do not materialize to the parents' (or grandparents') satisfaction, they still own the assets. No outside intermediaries need to be used.

On the other hand, income and capital gains from these assets will be taxed currently to the owners (except for the interest exclusion for U.S. savings bonds just discussed and interest from municipal securities). The assets also will not have been removed from the owner's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes, if this is an issue. The owners will have the unlimited gift tax exclusion for direct payments of tuition, but need to be careful to stay within the per-donee annual exclusion for the remainder of any expenses paid.

The nature of the assets accumulated for this purpose depends on the investment strategy and overall asset allocation position of the person or couple. For a younger child or grandchild, the accumulation period will be relatively long, and so good-quality common stocks or stock mutual funds might be appropriate. To be more conservative, a balanced mutual fund might be considered. On the other hand, the person or couple may want more security and therefore choose bonds or guaranteed principal investments.

For tax-efficient investments for this purpose, one possibility would be investment-grade, zero coupon municipal bonds, with maturities corresponding to the prospective student's years in school. These would approach the attractions of a 529 plan invested in a fixed-income option, except that their respective yields would have to be compared. The bonds' investment income would be income tax–free in all cases; the yield would be locked in for the maturity of the bonds; and they would be available to the owner to pay any education expenses, to make other gifts (presumably within the annual exclusions), or simply to keep for his or her own use (without any 10 percent penalty tax). However, the munis would be in the owner's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes, if he or she should die before they were used for education expenses or other needs. The real point of comparison then would seem to be the locked-in yield of the zero coupon munis as compared with the yield on investment in a 529 plan or an Education IRA of comparable quality and maturities. Of course, if only equity investments (e.g., common stocks) are desired, munis would not be a viable alternative.

#### **Overall Advantage of QTPs and Possible Diversification in Education Funding**

With all factors considered, it seems hard to beat a well-selected 529 plan, with flexible plan provisions, a reasonable number of well-managed investment options, and a reasonable expense ratio and other costs, as a vehicle for funding education costs. Such a plan or plans probably should be a core part of most education funding strategies.

However, as with most areas of financial planning, there is much to be said for a diversified approach. For example, along with a 529 plan, a person might have an Education IRA (if eligible) and possibly a UTMA or UGMA or a trust for the minor. Directly owned assets might also be used. Finally, some life and disability insurance arrangements will be needed in case the donor should die or become disabled before the education plan can be completed.

On the other hand, it should be noted that some commentators argue that for relatively wealthy donors, 529 plans should not be used. Rather, annual exclusion gifts for donee's should be made in other ways. Then, when the donees are in colleges or universities, tuition could be paid directly to the institution within the unlimited gift tax exclusion for such tuition.
