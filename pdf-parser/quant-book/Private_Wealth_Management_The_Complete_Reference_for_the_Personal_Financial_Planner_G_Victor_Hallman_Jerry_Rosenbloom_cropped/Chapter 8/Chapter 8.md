# **Kinds of Investment Companies**

In popular usage, the term *mutual fund* often is used to refer to any kind of investment company. Actually, however, there are three basic kinds of investment companies: those that sell *face-amount certificates* (the issuer promises to pay the investor a stated amount at maturity or a surrender value if tendered early), those that sell *unit investment trusts* (the fund invests in a fixed portfolio of securities), and so-called *management companies.* The most important of these are the management companies, which, in turn, can be classified as *closed-end funds* and open-end, or *mutual funds.* The open-end or mutual fund is, by far, the most important variety.

# **Why Invest in Mutual Funds?**

A number of advantages are given for investing in mutual funds. First, by pooling their investable capital, persons investing smaller amounts are able to enjoy a degree of diversification they could never achieve on their own. Second, mutual funds may offer experienced professional managers to select and manage the securities in which the funds' resources will be invested. And, third, mutual funds offer convenience and ready marketability through the funds' obligation to redeem their shares. Furthermore, funds provide investors with reasonable investment unit size so that many persons can invest through them. In addition, fund distributions normally can be reinvested systematically and investors' holdings can usually be liquidated systematically.

# **Limitations of Mutual Funds**

As with any financial intermediary, there are costs associated with investing through mutual funds. Expenses vary among funds, as discussed later in this chapter. Second, investors still must find those funds whose investment objectives are consistent with their own and whose performance and costs are satisfactory. Thus, the investor still has a selection issue, even though the choice of individual investments is transferred to the fund's management. Also, investors who want to make their own investment selections for part or all of their portfolios would not use investment intermediaries for this. Finally, as noted in Chapter 2, investment companies are essentially passthrough entities for tax purposes. Hence, investors often have capital gains distributions from their funds that they cannot control.

### **Types of Funds and Planning Considerations Open-End Funds**

A mutual fund is, by definition, an open-end investment company. They are called *open-end* because the number of outstanding shares is not fixed. Instead, the number of shares is continually changing as investors purchase or redeem shares. When people buy shares in an open-end fund, they buy them from the fund itself. And when they want to redeem shares, the fund must stand ready to buy them back. The price for purchase or redemption is based on the most recent net asset value (NAV) of the shares. NAV per share is the total value of all securities and other assets held by the fund, minus any fund liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding shares. It is calculated daily.

#### **Closed-End Funds**

A closed-end investment company is similar in many respects to a typical corporation. It issues a fixed number of shares, which does not fluctuate except as new stock is issued. The company can issue bonds and preferred stock to leverage the position of the common shareholders. The closed-end fund uses its capital and other resources primarily to invest in the securities of other corporations.

The shares of closed-end funds are bought and sold in the market, just like the stock of other corporations. The price for closed-end shares is determined by supply and demand in the market and is not tied directly to a fund's NAV per share. When the market price of a fund's shares exceeds its NAV, the fund is said to sell *at a premium.* On the other hand, when the stock price is less than a fund's NAV, it is said to sell *at a discount.* At any given time, some closed-end funds may sell at a premium while others sell at a discount.

#### **Open-End versus Closed-End Funds**

It is debatable as to which fund is better; there are no pat answers. But here are some things to consider.

First, both types provide professional investment management, diversification, and periodic distributions of investment income and capital gains to investors. They both are readily marketable, but in different ways—an openend fund through redemption of its shares by the fund itself and a closed-end fund by sale of its shares on the open market. There are many more openend funds than closed-end funds from which to choose, and open-end funds often are sold by sales representatives or brokers who handle mutual funds.

When an investor buys or sells a closed-end fund, he or she pays stock market commissions and other costs. Sales charges paid for mutual fund shares depend in part on whether it is a *load* or *no-load fund,* as described next. What fund shares are worth at any given time is determined differently. In the case of a mutual fund, it is the NAV of the fund shares at that time; for a closed-end fund, it is the price on the stock market at that time. Investors cannot buy a mutual fund for less than its NAV per share, but they frequently can buy a closed-end fund at a discount or at a premium.

#### **Load and No-Load Mutual Funds**

Open-end funds are sold on either a load or a no-load basis. A *load* generally refers to the sales charge levied on an investor by a fund for executing a transaction.

A common arrangement is when the investor pays the charge when purchasing shares but then pays no charge when redeeming them. This is referred to as a *front-end load* (or class A shares). Front-end loads might range from 4 to 8.5 percent of the offering price, but generally are about 4 to 5 percent.1 Thus, when a load fund is purchased, the investor pays the net asset value plus the load. No-load funds traditionally do not charge a sales commission (load) when the shares are purchased or redeemed. Thus, both transactions occur at the fund's NAV per share.

Some funds levy what are called *12b-1 fees* or level loads (referred to as class C shares). These are annual sales fees taken against fund assets to reimburse the fund for distribution and servicing costs.

Other funds charge a contingent-deferred sales fee (called a *back-end load* ) if shares are redeemed within a few years of their purchase or at any time (called class B shares). These fees may or may not decline over time. Finally, some funds are known as *low-load* funds because they charge lower loads (3 percent or less) at purchase.

Open-end fund values and prices are given daily in the financial pages of many newspapers and online. Prices are quoted on the NAV basis and an offering price (offer) basis. Any spread between the NAV and the offering price is the load. For a no-load fund, the quoted NAV and the offering price would be the same.

For load funds, the percentage load is normally reduced as an investor makes larger dollar purchases. The purchase amounts at which the percentage sales charge declines are called *breakpoints.* Also, an investor may be entitled to an *accumulation discount* or *right of accumulation* based on previous fund purchases. Thus, all fund shares held at the time an additional purchase is made may be taken into account in determining the sales load.

In addition to the sales loads of load funds and any annual 12b-1 sales fees, both load and no-load funds charge investment management fees and other expenses annually as a percentage of the fund's net assets. These annual fees are referred to as a fund's *expense ratio.*

Assuming an investor has decided to invest in mutual funds, he or she should consider whether to buy a load fund or a no-load fund. This is a controversial question; again, there are no pat answers. The greater part of the load paid by investors is received as a commission by the sales representative

<sup>1</sup>Note that this results in a slightly higher percentage load based on the net amount actually invested (i.e., the offering price minus the sales load, or the NAV per share). The NASD limits the loads mutual funds can charge. The limit on front-end loads is 8.5 percent and the limit on 12b-1 fees for load funds is 1 percent.

or broker. No-load funds frequently are not sold through sales representatives. Their shares normally are purchased and redeemed directly through the fund itself.2 Thus, no-load funds avoid the sales representative's commission. On the other hand, the mutual fund purchaser loses the advice and sales efforts of the representative.

### **Unit Investment Trusts**

Unit investment trusts (UITs) are registered investment companies that generally buy and hold a relatively fixed portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities until termination of the UIT. Thus, a UIT does not actively manage the investment portfolio over its lifetime. UITs also have a stated date for termination, which is not usually the case for other investment companies. UITs can have a number of different types of investments, such as corporate bonds, equities, mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds, U.S. government securities, and others. Investors may redeem their UIT units from the trust at any time for their NAV.

UITs may or may not charge a sales load. Their annual expenses (expense ratios) generally are low. Since they have a relatively fixed portfolio, there are few or no investment management fees. Also, their transaction costs are low, and since there is virtually no turnover of investments in their portfolios, investors' taxes are kept low. Thus, for investors who want diversification and initial portfolio selection but who do not want continuing active portfolio management, UITs may be attractive because of their lower costs. Most UITs have been municipal bond funds.

### **Regulation of Investment Companies**

Investment companies are primarily regulated under federal securities laws. As noted in Chapter 2, sales of shares or units are regulated under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A prospectus must be delivered to investors who purchase shares or units. The companies' day-by-day operations and structures are regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Furthermore, fund investment managers are governed by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC administers these federal laws. There may also be state securities regulations.

<sup>2</sup>Brokerage houses through which load funds channel their business are generally willing to handle transactions for affiliated no-load funds.

### **How to Invest in Mutual Funds**

There are a number of ways to invest in mutual funds, including outright purchase; various accumulation plans; reinvestment of dividends and realized capital gains payable from the fund; and through certain insurance products, such as variable annuities and variable life insurance. Mutual funds are also frequently held in tax-advantaged retirement accounts and education accounts.

It was noted previously that for load funds (i.e., class A shares), the front-end load may be reduced (i.e., discounts given) for large purchases of fund shares. These discounts (called breakpoint discounts) often begin at purchases of around \$50,000, but this varies among load funds. For example, a fund may have a normal front-end load of 5 percent, but the load is reduced to 4½ percent for purchases of \$50,000, to 4 percent for purchases of \$100,000, and by further discounts for larger purchases. Thus, these breakpoint discounts can be significant for load fund investors.

Some planning approaches investors can take to help reach breakpoints, depending on the rules of the particular fund or funds, include:

- N The right of accumulation (already discussed) which allows past fund purchases to count in reaching a breakpoint.
- N Letters of intent. In this case, the investor signs a letter of intent that he or she will purchase a certain amount of shares over a specified period (such as 13 months) and receives the appropriate breakpoint discount for the investor's actual periodic purchases over this time.
- N Counting purchases by other family members (e.g., spouse and children) of the investor in the same fund family.
- N Counting purchases by the investor for different accounts, such as outright purchase, 401(k) plans, IRAs, and education savings accounts.

### **Withdrawals from and Redemptions and Exchanges of Mutual Funds**

Mutual funds may offer *systematic withdrawal plans* to investors. An investor, for example, might establish a plan to pay a periodic amount to himself or herself, such as \$4,000 per month, as long as there are fund shares to do so. Remember, however, that such a systematic withdrawal plan is not the same as a life annuity. The periodic payments are not guaranteed for the investor's or a spouse's lifetime. Also, if an investor cashes in fund shares (either for periodic payments under a withdrawal plan or otherwise), he or she may have a capital gain or loss for income tax purposes, depending on whether the fund shares have appreciated or depreciated in value.

Management companies that handle several mutual funds (a *family* of funds) often permit investors to exchange all or part of their shares in one fund for those in another fund or funds they manage at net asset value. Thus, an investor who may have purchased shares in a growth stock fund during his or her working years might exchange them for shares in an income fund at retirement. Such an exchange, however, will be considered a sale or exchange of a capital asset for income tax purposes and, hence, normally will result in the investor's realizing and recognizing a capital gain or loss at that time. Furthermore, load funds may require the investor to pay any difference in the sales loads between the fund the investor had and the one into which he or she is exchanging shares. Exchange fees also may be involved, but they often are waived. Finally, funds may place other restrictions on this exchange privilege to avoid excessive trading by investors.

### **Mutual Funds and Their Investment Objectives**

There are mutual funds to meet just about any investment goal. A fund's investment objective and policies are described in its prospectus.

### **Equity Funds**

Equity funds invest their assets in common stocks and corresponding assets. They may include the following categories.

**Growth Funds** The primary objective of these funds is capital appreciation rather than current dividend income. Growth funds hold the common stocks of more established, larger growth-type companies.

**Aggressive Growth Funds** Again, the primary investment objective is capital appreciation. However, the investment policies tend to be more aggressive and riskier than the growth funds. These funds may hold common stocks in startup companies, newer industries, and turnaround situations, as well as regular growth-type stocks. They also may use other investment techniques, such as option writing.

**Growth and Income Funds** These funds are in the category referred to as *total return funds.* They invest in common stocks of well-established companies that are expected to show reasonable growth of principal and income and that pay reasonable current dividends. Their risk level is moderate.

#### **194 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

**Income-Equity Funds** These are another type of total return fund. They tend to invest in common stocks of companies with stable and good dividend returns. The emphasis is on secure and reasonable dividend yields and not on capital appreciation. Risk tends to be relatively low.

**Option-Income Funds** These funds also invest in dividend-paying common stocks, but they seek to maximize current return by writing call options on the stock they hold.

**International Equity Funds** These funds invest mainly in the stocks of foreign companies.

**Global Equity Funds** These funds invest in the common stocks of both foreign and U.S. companies.

**Small-Stock (Small-Cap) Funds** As the name implies, the objective of these funds is to invest in common stocks of smaller, lesser-known companies. Some argue that over the years small-cap stocks have generally performed better than their larger-cap brethren have but are more volatile. This has been shown in the historical yield studies described in Chapter 5. Mutual funds seem to be a particularly appropriate vehicle for investing in smaller stocks, because most investors probably do not have the time, knowledge, or resources to evaluate a large number of lesser-known companies.

**Precious Metals Funds** The investment objective here is to invest primarily in the common stocks of gold-mining companies and companies that produce other precious metals. These stocks can be viewed as surrogates for holding gold or other precious metals directly, since the prices of these stocks tend to move with the market prices of the precious metals they produce rather than with the stock market in general. Thus, investors can use these funds for any gold or precious metals component of their asset allocation, if they desire such a component.

**Sector Funds** These funds invest in common stocks of companies in particular fields or industries, such as financial services, health care, science and technology, natural resources, utilities, and so forth. They give investors an opportunity to concentrate their holdings in fields they view as attractive.

### **Hybrid Funds**

These funds maintain a diversified portfolio in terms of kinds of investment media.

**Asset Allocation Funds** Funds of this type are required to maintain a fixed weighting (asset allocation) of stocks, bonds, and perhaps money market instruments. Thus, they may enable investors to implement an asset allocation strategy largely through the purchase of one mutual fund, rather than through several funds or other assets. One mutual fund group, for example, maintains four separate asset allocation funds, ranging from one with a growth orientation (80 percent stocks and 20 percent bonds) to one designed mainly for income (20 percent stocks, 60 percent bonds, and 20 percent cash reserves).

**Balanced Funds** The investment approach of these funds is to have a diversified portfolio of common stocks, preferred stocks, and bonds. The asset allocation of these investment media will be indicated in the fund's prospectus or elsewhere, and may change, depending on the investment policies of the fund's management. The objectives of these funds are to conserve principal, pay reasonable current income, and achieve long-term growth in principal and income consistent with the prior two objectives. They differ from asset allocation funds in that they do not maintain a fixed weighting of asset classes.

**Flexible Portfolio Funds** These funds differ from balanced funds mainly in that they may change their asset allocation more rapidly and may hold up to 100 percent of their assets in only one type of asset at any given time.

**Income-Mixed Funds** The investment objective of these funds is high current income. This is achieved by investing in good dividend-paying common stocks and corporate and government bonds.

### **Taxable Bond Funds**

These funds invest primarily in taxable bonds of various kinds, depending on the investment objective of the particular fund. It may be noted that when an investor invests in bonds through a mutual fund or other pooled intermediaries, rather than owning the bonds directly, there is no fixed maturity date for the mutual fund shareholder. The NAV of the bond-fund shares fluctuates with the current market prices of the bonds in its portfolio.

**U.S. Treasury Bond Funds** These funds invest primarily in U.S. Treasury bonds. They are, therefore, viewed as completely safe in terms of financial risk, while their interest rate risk depends on their average duration. As noted earlier, U.S. Treasury bonds normally are not callable prior to maturity. In terms of duration, U.S. Treasury bond funds can have varying maturities, such as short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term. Such funds can be used to diversify a bond portfolio by duration and to provide call protection.

**U.S. Government Income Funds** These funds seek a somewhat higher yield by investing in a variety of U.S. Treasury bonds, federally guaranteed securities, and other government securities.

#### **196 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

**Ginnie Mae (Government National Mortgage Association) Funds** As the name implies, these funds are invested mainly in government-backed, mortgage-backed securities.

**Corporate Bond Funds** The objective of some corporate bond funds is to invest in a diversified portfolio of high-quality bonds. In this case, the fund's financial risk is low and its interest rate risks depend on the bonds' maturities and call protection. Maturities can be short-term, intermediate-term, or long-term.

**High-Yield (High-Risk or Junk) Bond Funds** The objective of these funds is to secure a higher yield by accepting the greater financial risk of buying lower-quality bonds. However, not all high-yield bond funds are equally risky. They vary in the average quality of the bonds in their portfolios and the levels of their cash reserves.

**Income Bond Funds** These funds invest in a combination of corporate bonds and government bonds for greater yield.

**International Bond Funds** These funds invest in the bonds of foreign companies, foreign governments, or both. The market prices of the bonds are expressed in the currencies of the foreign countries whose bonds are held by the fund. Thus, as the value of these countries' currencies changes in relation to the dollar, so will the share value of these funds expressed in dollars. As a result, there can be three kinds of investment risk in these funds: financial risk, interest rate risk, and currency risk. Thus, purchase of these funds enables investors to take an indirect position in foreign currencies and diversify their portfolios in terms of currencies. (Of course, an investor could buy directly one or more foreign currencies or purchase some mutual funds that invest in foreign currencies.) This currency exposure is also present in international stock funds and, in varying degrees, in global equity funds and global bond funds. Some international bond funds seek to hedge against this currency risk in various ways. In this case, investors may not have full exposure to currency fluctuations.

**Global Bond Funds** These funds invest in bonds of foreign companies and countries as well as in those originating in the United States.

### **Municipal Bond Funds**

**National Municipal Bond Funds** These funds invest in the bonds and other securities issued by states, cities, and other municipalities throughout the nation. In terms of duration, there are long-term, intermediate-term, and short-term funds. There are also funds that invest only in investment-grade municipal securities, while others may buy lower-quality (junk) municipals.

**State Municipal Bond Funds** These are municipal bond funds that invest only in the securities of a particular state. This enables the residents of that state to buy a fund for their state only and thus have tax-free interest income from the fund for federal, state, and local income tax purposes.

### **Money Market Mutual Funds**

**General Considerations** These funds are highly secure, liquid investments that frequently are used by investors for the cash portion of their portfolios. They are generally viewed as cash equivalents because the mutual fund management companies selling their shares expect and intend to be able to redeem them at all times at a fixed value, normally \$1 per share. Many money market funds also offer investors check-writing privileges. Thus, these funds are intended to be safe, liquid, and convenient. They also typically provide higher yields than bank money market accounts.

However, there is no guarantee that the shares of money market mutual funds will be redeemed at the fixed value or par. It is possible that a fund's expense ratio or poor investments could result in its not redeeming its shares at par. Thus, investors should pay attention to the expense ratios and the nature and quality of the underlying short-term assets of money market mutual funds. Bank money market accounts, on the other hand, technically are accounts in the bank that, as of this writing, are insured up to \$250,000 per eligible account by the FDIC.

**Taxable Money Market Funds** The dividends paid by these funds are gross income to shareholders for federal income tax purposes and perhaps for state and local income taxes as well. Some taxable funds invest only in direct *U.S. Treasury obligations*. These would be the safest in terms of financial risk. Others invest in *U.S. Treasury obligations and other obligations guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies*. Still others invest in a *variety of money market investments*, such as CDs, commercial paper, and bankers' acceptances.

**Tax-Exempt Money Market Funds** The dividends paid by these funds generally are excluded from shareholders' gross income for federal income tax purposes and may be excluded for state and local income tax purposes. These funds may be national tax-exempt money market funds or state tax-exempt money market funds.

# **Index Funds**

#### **Active versus Passive Investment Management**

The mutual funds we have considered thus far are *actively managed funds.* That is, fund managers attempt to select investments that will show superior results and outperform their particular benchmark indexes.

However, a newer concept in mutual funds is for a fund's portfolio to duplicate or track a specific group or index of securities. These are *index funds.* They are considered *passively managed* because the fund manager does not attempt to pick individual securities but only to track the outside index.

#### **General Considerations**

Index funds can invest in common stocks, bonds, and other securities, but they generally have been common stock funds. They can be based on a variety of indexes, such as Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 (consisting of large-company stocks), the Wilshire 5000 (generally all stocks traded in the U.S. stock markets), the Wilshire 4500 (the Wilshire 5000 minus the S&P 500), the Russell 2000 (small-cap stocks traded in the U.S. stock markets), and various international indexes, such as the EAFE® (stocks from Europe, Australia, and the Far East).

#### **Rationale for Index Funds**

Several arguments have been advanced in favor of index funds.

**Cost** Index funds have significantly lower expense ratios than actively managed funds. Since they are passively managed, their investment management and research expenses are much lower. Furthermore, since they have a low turnover of securities, their transaction costs are low.

**Alleged Difficulty in Beating the Market** Commentators have suggested that, as a practical matter, it is difficult for a managed fund (or for other investors) consistently to outperform the overall market for any sustained period. Also, actively managed funds, in some cases, may not even perform as well as the overall market. Therefore, the argument goes, one might just as well invest with the overall market or a part of it and reap the advantage of lower costs of index funds. This argument, of course, fits well with the efficient market hypothesis discussed in Chapter 4.

**Tax Considerations** Since index funds have low turnover, there are relatively few sales of stocks by the fund and hence, relatively low capital gains being passed through to shareholders. This tax advantage essentially applies to any fund or security portfolio with low turnover.

### **Limitations of Index Funds**

Naturally, arguments against index funds also exist.

**Alleged Superior Investment Performance of Actively Managed Funds** Proponents of actively managed funds argue that their particular fund will outperform the overall market, as some in fact have. Thus, the counterargument goes, their superior performance will more than justify any increased costs. This is the crux of the argument. An investor can evaluate this argument by analyzing past comparable performance over a substantial period for the particular actively managed fund or funds and the index fund or funds being considered. Of course, as with any analysis of past performance, investors must recognize that it may not be repeated in the future.

**Loss of Investor Selection** Some investors like to select among actively managed mutual funds to try to identify the better performers. Also, investors may want to buy some actively managed sector funds in areas or industries they view as particularly attractive.

**Market Risks** By their nature, stock index funds are fully invested in equities at all times because they simply mirror a stock index. During bull markets, this will result in good returns. However, during market declines or bear markets, the reverse may be true, since the index fund will remain in the market. Actively managed funds, on the other hand, may hold varying proportions of their assets in cash or other securities, depending on their view of market conditions and their investment objectives.

# **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**

Unlike mutual funds, the newer ETFs are traded on an organized exchange, bought and sold through brokerage firms that charge commissions, and their market prices may be more or less than the NAV of the securities in the ETF. The market prices of ETF shares are determined by the values of the securities in the fund, as well as supply and demand conditions in the stock market for fund shares. Their market prices should be reasonably close to underlying fund values, but there is no assurance of that. ETFs are not redeemable from the funds, as are mutual funds. The arguments made for ETFs are that they have continual pricing, can be traded through limit orders, can be sold short, and can be bought on margin. They also may have lower operating costs. ETFs generally are index funds and so, in effect, can be used to "short the market" if that is desired.

The original ETFs were index funds and so share the advantages and limitations just cited for index funds in general. Most of the ETFs today are still index funds. Some track broad indexes (like the S&P 500), but others track narrower-sector indexes. A few actively managed ETFs have recently been created.

# **Tax-Managed Funds**

Another newer concept is the tax-managed mutual fund. These funds operate with the objective of minimizing the impact of income taxes on the investment returns to their shareholders. Dividends and interest received and capital gains realized by mutual funds each year are passed through and taxable to the shareholders. The mutual fund itself pays no income taxes. Taxmanaged funds follow investment policies intended to minimize this impact on shareholders. Such policies might include the following:

- N *Minimizing the realization and distribution of capital gains*. This essentially involves a buy-and-hold approach that minimizes portfolio turnover.
- N *Emphasizing lower current yielding securities*. Current dividends are taxable each year to shareholders. Hence, they are deemphasized. This tends to favor a long-term growth-type approach.
- N *Adopting a tax-efficient selling selection policy*. When these funds sell appreciated securities for investment reasons, they seek to sell particular lots of securities that will produce long-term capital gains (as opposed to shortterm gains) and that have the highest income tax bases (thereby reducing the long-term gains). They also seek to offset gains by realizing capital losses on other securities in the same year, when feasible.
- N *Meeting shareholder redemptions by distributing appreciated securities in kind*. Some funds may follow this policy.

It is noteworthy that these policies can be employed just as effectively by individual investors managing their own investment portfolios tax efficiently.

# **Other Types of Funds**

One specialized type of fund is the dual fund. A *dual fund* is organized as a closed-end investment company and is really two funds in one. Dual funds are based on the premise that some investors are interested exclusively in capital gains, while others are interested only in income. Thus, half of a dual fund's shares are sold as capital shares and the other half as income shares. The capital shares benefit from any capital appreciation of the entire fund, while the income shares receive all the income.

### **Mutual Fund Performance**

Several areas of performance should be of interest to investors.

#### **Administrative Performance**

One area is the investment management fees and other administrative costs to the investor. This is generally evaluated by expressing total operating expenses as a percentage of a fund's net assets (the *expense ratio*) or as a percentage of fund income (the *income ratio*).

#### **Investment Performance**

A commonly used measure of investment performance is to analyze the *total return* (annual income dividends paid, realized capital gain distributions, and price fluctuations of the fund's shares) over a period. For example, assume a fund's purchase price at the beginning of a period—say, a year—is \$40 and at the end of the year is \$42. Also, assume the fund paid \$1.00 in annual income dividends and had \$1.80 in realized capital gain distributions for the year. In this case, the fund's total return for the year would be \$4.80. Assuming the investor did not redeem the shares at the end of the year, \$1.00 of this total return would be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income or qualified dividends and \$1.80 would be taxable as either short-term or long-term capital gains (depending on how long the fund held the securities sold).3 Thus, in this example, the before-tax total return for the year, based on the original purchase price, would be 12 percent (\$4.80 ÷ \$40 = 0.12 or 12 percent).

Funds usually show total return performance data over several periods, such as 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years. Longer periods probably are more

<sup>3</sup>The change in the fund's share price would not be subject to income taxation until the shareholder actually redeemed the shares. At that time, the total change would be a short-term or long-term capital gain or short-term or long-term capital loss, depending on how long the shareholder held the fund shares redeemed and whether there was a gain or loss at redemption. Of course, if the fund shares were held in a tax-protected vehicle, like an IRA or Section 401(k) plan, there would be no income taxation until distributions are taken from the taxprotected plan, and then they would be taxed as ordinary income (except for Roth IRAs).

meaningful for comparison purposes, since one- or even three-year periods may include unusual years, either up or down.

One way in which funds show total return performance is *cumulative total return* (as a percentage of initial share value) over a given period. This is the total change in the value of the fund's shares over the period, assuming reinvestment of income dividends and capital gain distributions.

Another common way to show total performance is *average annual compound rate of total return* (usually called *average annual total return*) over the period. This is the same rate of total return concept explained in Chapter 4. It is the compound level rate of return required each year to cause the initial share value to equal the share value at the end of the period, assuming reinvestment of income dividends and capital gain distributions. It is an internal rate of return (IRR) concept. These figures for cumulative total percentage return and average annual compound rate of total return for a particular fund often are compared with similar data for other indexes and averages. In the case of load funds, these performance measures can be *load-adjusted* to reflect the fund's sales charges. Such an adjustment can substantially reduce one-year returns, but it tends to diminish in importance over longer periods.

To illustrate these concepts, Table 8.1 shows performance data from the prospectus of a load-growth stock mutual fund for various periods.

It can be seen from this illustration that when a longer time horizon is used (such as 10 years), differences among the performances being compared narrow considerably. This also often is true for mutual funds in general.

| Average Annual Total          | Over the Past |         |          |
|-------------------------------|---------------|---------|----------|

**Table 8.1.** Performance Data from the Prospectus of a Load-Growth Stock Mutual Fund

\*This fund has a 3 percent front-end load.

Tax-managed funds and other funds may show average annual total returns on a before-tax and an after-tax basis.4 For example, one tax-managed growth stock mutual fund showed the following comparison for a 10-year period:

#### **Average annual total returns (before shareholder taxes):**

This tax-managed growth fund: 14.9% Average of 190 growth funds: 13.5%

**Average annual total returns (after assumed shareholder taxes):**

This tax-managed growth fund: 14.2% Average of 190 growth funds: 10.9%

It may be noted in the above that comparisons were made between the particular fund and other averages or indexes (Lipper growth funds average and S&P 500 Stock Index in Table 8.1) and the average of 190 growth funds for the tax-managed fund. These comparison averages and indexes are called *benchmarks* and are commonly used in mutual fund performance comparisons.

**Volatility** Various measures of volatility of mutual fund share prices are used. These include the beta, R-squared, alpha, and standard deviation. They are described in Chapter 4.

### **Considerations in Evaluating Investment Performance**

Mutual fund investment performance data should be evaluated before investing in a fund. However, certain cautions are in order in making such evaluations. First, comparisons should be made based on several years' performance, such as 5, 10, or even 20 years. Be careful, too, about evaluating performance only during good times. Second, it is important to consider investment objectives of a fund. For example, a balanced fund should do better than a growth fund in a declining market, while the opposite should be true in a sharply advancing market. Also, consider the risks of market volatility involved.

### **Mutual Fund Expense Ratios**

Fund expenses are required to be summarized and illustrated at the beginning of each fund's prospectus. The following summary of expenses for a load-growth stock fund is given only as an illustration.

<sup>4</sup> Such comparisons, of course, require assumptions concerning taxes and tax rates. In this example, the highest historical individual federal income tax rates were assumed. State and local income taxes and any taxes due on redemption of shares were ignored.

#### **Summary of fund expenses:**

A. Shareholder buying and selling expenses: Sales charge on purchases (the front-end load for a low load mutual fund): 3.00% Sales charge on reinvested distributions: None Deferred sales charge on redemptions (the back-end load used by some funds): None Exchange fee (imposed by some funds for exchanges into another fund within a family of mutual funds): None B. Annual fund operating expenses (as percentage of average net assets): Management fee (investment management fees generally charged by mutual funds): 0.45% 12b-1 fee (sales and marketing fees charged by some mutual funds instead of or in addition to any front-end sales load): None

 Other expenses (such as administrative or servicing fees): 0.21% Total fund operating expenses: 0.66%

The *expense ratio* of the fund illustrated is 0.66 percent. Expense ratios vary considerably among funds. They should be evaluated in conjunction with a fund's overall investment performance over a significant period.

# **Transaction Costs**

These are the costs incurred by the fund in buying and selling securities for its portfolio, such as brokerage charges. Transaction costs are not included in a fund's published expense ratio. They are deducted from fund assets and so are an additional annual expense for the shareholders. They are not disclosed to shareholders in fund reports, but a fund's turnover rate is disclosed. They are directly related to fund turnover, as noted next.

# **Factors Involved in Selecting Mutual Funds**

Here are some ideas that may be helpful in this important choice of selecting mutual funds:

- N Determine whether the fund's objectives, investment style, and investment policies generally coincide with the investor's objectives and asset allocation strategy.
- N Decide whether the investor wants an actively managed fund or a passively managed index fund.

- N Consider the fund's past performance in light of its objectives.
- N Ascertain the qualifications and experience of the people managing the fund's portfolio. The tenure of the portfolio manager (how long the manager has been managing the fund) also is significant.
- N Briefly look over the securities in the fund's portfolio to see how well selected they seem to be.
- N If it is a load fund, consider its sales charges to see how they compare with those of similar funds.
- N Consider the fund's annual operating expenses (expense ratio) in comparison to those of similar funds and in light of fund performance.
- N Consider the shareholder services the fund will make available to investors, including the right of accumulation, available investment plans, systematic withdrawal plans, and any exchange privilege.
- N Remember that funds normally are considered long-term investments. Therefore, do not be too concerned with strictly short-term changes in fund values.
- N Consider the fund's turnover rate for its portfolio. The turnover rate is calculated by dividing the smaller of the fund's total purchases or total sales of securities by its average monthly assets. A turnover rate of 100 percent, for example, means the fund has sold and replaced 100 percent in value of its assets during the year. A high turnover rate may mean the fund will have large capital gain distributions, and hence tax liabilities, for its shareholders. It also will increase transaction costs for the fund. And finally, it implies an active investment management style.
- N Look out for style slippage in fund investment policies. Style slippage exists when a difference develops between the investment style or policies proclaimed by a fund and those actually followed. As a practical matter, this may be difficult for an investor to detect.
- N Consider how long the fund has been in existence. Recent funds have not had much time to develop a track record for investors to consider.
- N Consider any minimum investment amounts required by the fund.

### **Tax Aspects of Mutual Funds**

Mutual funds are taxed as regulated investment companies, as noted in Chapter 2. Thus, funds pay out investment income to shareholders as various kinds of dividends, and the shareholders report those dividends on their tax returns as taxable or nontaxable, depending on the nature of the dividends. The fund itself pays no tax and operates essentially on a pass-through basis.

#### **Types of Distributions for Tax Purposes**

There are several kinds of such dividends: ordinary income dividends from the fund's net ordinary investment income and short-term capital gains, qualified dividend income, tax-exempt interest dividends (provided at least 50 percent of the fund's assets are in tax-exempt securities), and capital gains dividends (as long-term capital gains to the fund, regardless of how long the shareholder owned the fund's shares). Ordinary income dividends and qualified dividends are taxed to shareholders, tax-exempt interest dividends are not included in shareholders' gross income (except for AMT purposes in the case of certain private activity municipal bonds), and capital gains dividends are taxed as capital gains of shareholders in the year they are received.

Dividends that are automatically reinvested in additional fund shares are treated as constructively received by the shareholder and are taxed currently to the shareholder. However, if mutual fund shares are used as the investment medium for a plan that itself is tax sheltered (e.g., an IRA), the net investment income and capital gains dividends are not taxable until paid out from the tax-sheltered plan. The same, of course, would be true for any investments used in such plans.

#### **Redemptions and Exchanges of Mutual Fund Shares**

The preceding discussion dealt with taxation of distributions to shareholders of the investment income of funds. However, a mutual fund shareholder may have a taxable capital gain or a capital loss in the event he or she sells, exchanges, or redeems his or her mutual fund shares.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose Harry Wilson invested \$10,000 in a growth stock mutual fund 15 years ago and all dividends were automatically reinvested. The shares are now worth \$55,000; Harry's income tax basis in them (the initial \$10,000 purchase price plus the dollar amount of the reinvested dividends) is \$17,000. Harry is planning to retire and would now like to pursue a more conservative asset allocation approach. Therefore, he is planning to exchange his growth stock fund for shares in a growth and income fund maintained in the same family of funds. The fund permits such exchanges without another sales load and with no exchange fees. However, this exchange of one fund for another is a sale or *exchange* of a capital asset for capital gains tax purposes and results in a long-term capital gain in this case. Therefore, Harry has an amount realized of \$55,000 and an adjusted income tax basis of \$17,000, which results in a long-term capital gain realized and recognized in the year of the exchange of \$38,000 (\$55,000 – \$17,000 = \$38,000). The result would be the same had Harry exchanged his growth fund for any other mutual fund or had redeemed his shares from the fund. But if the growth stock fund were inside a plan that is tax sheltered—say, an HR-10 plan or a rollover IRA—the exchange (or a redemption) would not result in any capital gains tax. Instead, the assets would be taxable as ordinary income when they are finally distributed from the tax-sheltered plan.

#### **Income Tax Basis of Fund Shares**

When a mutual fund shareholder sells, redeems, or exchanges all of the shares he or she owns, the total income tax basis of the shares is used to calculate any capital gain or loss, as just illustrated. If a shareholder acquires all of his or her shares at the same time and with the same basis, the sale, redemption, or exchange of only part of the shares owned will be at the shareholder's basis and holding period for that part of the shares.

However, if the mutual fund shares were acquired over time and for different prices, as in an automatic dividend reinvestment plan, the taxpayer has some flexibility in determining the income tax basis in the case of a sale, redemption, or exchange of only part of the shares owned. If the shareholder can adequately identify the group from which the shares sold, redeemed, or exchanged came, that basis and holding period can be used (as is true of securities in general, as noted in Chapter 10). If the shareholder cannot identify the group adequately or elects not to use this specific identification method, he or she has three other choices in determining the basis and holding period for the shares disposed of. The shareholder may assume that the earlier acquired shares were those sold. This is a *first-in, first-out (FIFO) concept.* Or, the shareholder may elect to use either one of two *average cost methods* for determining basis and holding period. The two alternative averaging methods are a *double-category method* and a *single-category method.* The shareholder qualifies to elect one of these averaging methods if the shares are held in a custodial account maintained for the acquisition or redemption of fund shares and the shareholder purchased or acquired the shares at different bases.

Once a shareholder elects to use one of these four methods for the shares of a particular fund, he or she is not permitted to switch to another method for that fund. However, an investor may employ different methods for different funds.

# **Closed-End Companies**

If a closed-end company elects to be taxed as a regulated investment company, its shareholders will be taxed as described previously for mutual fund shareholders.

# **Look Out for Buying a Dividend**

The situation referred to as *buying a dividend* occurs when a purchaser of fund shares buys them shortly before the *ex-dividend date* (or *record date*) of a distribution from the fund. This normally is not tax efficient, because the value of the shares usually will fall by about the amount of the dividend payable, but the dividend will be taxable to the purchasing shareholder. Thus, the purchaser's total position (shares plus after-tax dividend) will be reduced by the amount of the income tax on the dividend, as compared with the purchaser's total position (shares ex-dividend) if he or she had waited until after the ex-dividend date to buy the fund shares. Mutual funds often will provide the dates and estimated amounts of future distributions so investors can plan accordingly. This same general principle also applies to purchases of common stocks.

# **Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds**

The term "alternative investments" usually means investments in real estate (which was covered in Chapter 6), hedge funds, and private equity funds. However, it may also include other investment classes, such as oil and gas, timber, other natural resources, and so forth. Here we shall discuss hedge funds and private equity funds.

### **Hedge Funds**

Hedge funds differ from mutual funds in several respects. First, while mutual funds are registered investment companies whose operations are regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, domestic hedge funds are normally organized as *investment limited partnerships* or *limited liability companies,* with the investors being limited partners or members and the investment manager being a general partner or managing member who runs the fund's affairs. Hedge funds are largely unregulated. Second, while hedge funds charge management fees that are a percentage of assets under management, they also commonly charge *incentive fees,* which are a percentage (such as 20 percent) of the realized and unrealized gains of the fund. In addition, for regulatory reasons, hedge funds and private equity funds accept only a limited number of investors and those investors generally must be accredited investors and qualified purchasers. These kinds of investors were defined and explained in Chapter 2.

Hedge funds have traditionally been characterized by their investment strategies. The classical concept is that hedge funds have an advantageous risk-return situation because they may take opposite investment positions at the same time and thus profit from their hoped-for superior investment selection models and techniques, whether an overall market goes up or down. They hope to have very low or no correlations in investment risks and returns among investment positions they take. As an example, hedge funds may purchase (be long in) common stocks they believe will outperform the market and at the same time sell short (be short in) other stocks they believe will underperform the market. If the overall stock market rises, investors hope that the good long positions will rise more than any losses in unfavorable short positions (which may even be profitable if well selected) and thus investors will make money. Correspondingly, if the overall market declines, it is hoped the good short positions (the favorable ones in this scenario) will fall more than the now-unfavorable long positions (which may even hold their value or rise if well selected) and thus again the fund investors will make money. Thus, hedge fund investors hope for superior and stable returns. This may be referred to as a long/short strategy.

In addition to short sales, hedge funds may make extensive use of financial leverage (debt) to magnify their positions. They also may use arbitrage, options, futures, and other derivatives to enhance returns and help control risk. There are many different kinds of hedge funds, and each uses a variety of financial techniques and invests globally.

Some hedge funds are structured to invest in other hedge funds. They are called *funds of funds.* This relieves the investor of the problem of selecting appropriate hedge funds (investment manager risk), but increases costs because both the funds of funds and the funds selected charge sizeable fees. In recent years, some securities firms have established funds of funds with smaller required initial investment amounts.

Hedge funds are not liquid or marketable investments. They generally are not publicly traded and may have, for example, a one-year lock-up period for initial investments.

Since they are organized as partnerships or LLCs, they operate as flowthrough income tax entities. Thus, their profits and losses pass through to the investors. Profits often are short-term (one year or less) and so are taxed as ordinary income to taxable investors. Thus, hedge funds generally are not tax-efficient entities for taxable investors.

#### **210 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

One of the arguments made by advocates of including hedge funds (or private equity) in an individual's or trust's investment portfolio is that the funds produce above-average returns but have low correlations with other asset classes such as stocks and bonds. Thus, using modern portfolio theory, they produce above-average returns with less overall portfolio risk. On the other hand, they are not readily liquid or marketable, have high costs, are not regulated or transparent, are highly leveraged, and have not really been tested during severe economic conditions. Of course, people have opinions on both sides of this issue.

#### **Private Equity or Venture Capital**

These funds are structured and operate much like hedge funds. They invest in other companies (sometimes called "portfolio companies") at various stages of the portfolio companies' development.

There are general categories of private equity. Probably the earliest was *venture capital* (VC), where the private equity firm helped finance and advised startup companies. In recent years, private equity funds have engaged in *leveraged buyouts* (LBOs) of established businesses. Typically, the acquired business would take on a large amount of debt because of the buyout. The private equity firm then would sell the business or conduct an IPO of its shares. The final category is *mezzanine financing,* where the private equity firm lends money with a fixed maturity date to the portfolio company.
