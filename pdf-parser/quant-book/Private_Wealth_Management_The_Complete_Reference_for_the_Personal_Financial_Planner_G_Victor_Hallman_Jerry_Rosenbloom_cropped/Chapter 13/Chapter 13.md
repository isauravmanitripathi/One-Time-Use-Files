# **Retirement Needs Analysis Assumptions for Retirement Planning**

The assumption is often made that people's financial needs decrease after retirement. To some extent, this assumption may be valid. However, the actual reduction in the financial needs of retired persons probably has been overstated. These people normally do not want any drastic change in their standards of living at retirement. Expenses for medical care, and perhaps custodial care (longterm care), probably will increase significantly during retirement. Also, retired persons may have travel plans or other recreational goals in mind.

In addition, depending on the circumstances, retirees may find themselves in the position of wanting (or needing) to help their adult children or grandchildren financially. They may help fund the education costs for grandchildren or even children and may provide down payments for first-time home purchases, for example. Individuals and their advisers should not forget what economic forces, such as inflation or deflation, can do to their carefully planned retirement income. While assumptions concerning inflation traditionally have been made in retirement planning, the possibility of deflation should not be ignored.

Another factor affecting planning is that some persons wish to retire at younger ages than the traditional age 65. Also, life expectancy has increased dramatically. Within the past 70 years, for example, life expectancy at birth has increased from around 47 years to 80 years or more. An assumption needs to be made concerning the potential retirement period of retirees. Also, in making this assumption it must be remembered that individual retirees may live well beyond their statistical life expectancies. Finally, persons near or in retirement often have family giving or bequest goals and charitable giving objectives. These may be carried out during the persons' lifetimes (lifetime gifts) or at death. Hence, many persons wish to have or retain assets for these purposes.

### **Steps in the Retirement Income Planning Process**

There are many issues involved in planning for retirement, but certainly an important one is assuring adequate retirement income. The steps in the process for doing so can be outlined as follows:

- 1. Set desired retirement age.
- 2. Identify sources of retirement income.
- 3. Project estimated retirement income (by source) to desired retirement age.

- 4. Estimate income needed at desired retirement age in current dollars.
- 5. Adjust estimated retirement income needed and projected retirement income available at desired retirement age for estimated inflation, if any, from the present to the desired retirement age.
- 6. Compare retirement income needed with projected retirement income available both in current dollars and adjusted (where appropriate) for preretirement inflation as of the desired retirement age.
- 7. Compare projected postretirement income needs and projected postretirement income available (both adjusted for preretirement and postretirement inflation, if any) on a year-by-year basis to see how available income will meet expected needs during retirement.
- 8. Plan for meeting any deficiencies in projected retirement income as compared with retirement needs, as noted later in the section on alternatives, to compensate for projected cash-flow shortfalls.
- 9. Consider how and when benefits should be paid from the various sources of retirement income to the extent the person or couple has discretion in the matter.
- 10. Plan for the beneficiary designations in retirement plans when appropriate.
- 11. Review and revise the plan periodically as appropriate.

# **Sources of Retirement Income**

The task of providing retirement income generally falls on people's ability to accumulate assets during their working years, government programs, and employer-provided plans. People frequently receive retirement benefits from all these sources.

**Individually Provided Retirement Income** Many people accumulate an investment fund, IRAs, individual nonqualified annuities, life insurance cash values, and other funds during their working years to help provide for their retirement. This seems only prudent.

**Social Security Old-Age (Retirement) Benefits** The essential purpose of Social Security is to provide a guaranteed income floor on which a more comfortable level of retirement income can be built by the individual and his or her employer. Unfortunately, however, in some cases, Social Security is expected (universally) to provide the main source of retirement income. Social Security is described in more detail later in this chapter.

**Employer-Provided Retirement Plans** Many employers have established tax-favored retirement plans. These are referred to in the tax law as "qualified retirement plans." The main types of these plans are described in this chapter.

### **Expected Total Returns Assumed During Retirement**

This important assumption involves an estimate of the rate of return that can be expected on the person's or couple's retirement assets. Such an estimate depends on the characteristics of the retirement assets, whether capital is being liquidated to provide retirement income (as in a life annuity, for example), and on the asset allocation chosen for investments during retirement.

**Straight-Line Returns versus Probability Analysis** In making this estimate, one can determine the returns currently being received or estimate what those returns should be in the future (often based on historical studies) and then assume the estimated returns will continue into the future without significant variation. It then can be determined how these expected returns compare with expected outlays during retirement. These might be referred to as *straight-line returns* or average returns.

On the other hand, a *probabilistic analysis* would use computer programs to simulate thousands of market scenarios and various asset allocation strategies to develop probabilities of success for different investment and withdrawal strategies. Various assumptions are made concerning expected annual returns from different asset classes and their correlations. This approach is also referred to as a *Monte Carlo analysis*.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose Harry and Susan Wong, both age 70, are preparing to retire. They have a combined investment portfolio of about \$1,500,000 as well as pension and Social Security benefits. They would like to know how much of their investment portfolio they can safely withdraw each year without running out of money. Their financial adviser tells them that based on a Monte Carlo simulation, and assuming their investment portfolio is placed 40 percent in common stocks, 40 percent in investment grade bonds, and 20 percent in cash equivalents, there is a 99 percent probability that if they take 4 percent of the initial amount (increased each year by an assumed 3 percent inflation rate), or about \$60,000 per year (\$5,000 per month), for the next 25 years (or until they are 95), their investment portfolio will not be exhausted (i.e., they will not run out of money). On the other hand, using the same assumptions, if they increase their withdrawals to 5 percent of the initial amount, or about \$75,000 per year (\$6,250 per month), there is only an 80 percent probability that the Wongs will not run out of money over the 25 years.

This example illustrates what is often called the "*4% solution*." This means that with a 4 percent withdrawal rate (plus an annual constant increase to reflect assumed inflation), many Monte Carlo simulations show there is a high probability (90 percent or better) that that retiree will not run out of money for a substantial period of time (e.g., 25 or 30 years), depending on the assumptions made.

However, it must be noted that these simulations are heavily dependent on the assumptions inherent in them. Also, taxes typically are not taken into account. Furthermore, extreme market movements or crises probably will seriously distort the model's results. Finally, there is no guarantee that the withdrawal results predicted by the model will hold true. They are not like life annuities sold by life insurance companies or guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWBs) sold by some life insurers.

**Life Annuity (Pure Annuity) versus Capital Preservation** This is a basic tradeoff decision in retirement planning. Payment of retirement benefits as a *life annuity* involves payments for as long as one or two persons live (the annuitants) and ceases upon the person's death or the death of the last of the two annuitants (except for any survivors' benefits). This involves liquidating capital (i.e., liquidating the cost of the life annuity) over the annuitants' lifetimes. By doing so, the annuitants are guaranteed an income they cannot outlive. They also are increasing their retirement income (as compared with just investing their capital in securities of comparable risk) because annuitizing involves the systematic liquidation of the amount invested in the annuity (i.e., capital). Therefore, each annuity payment consists of investment income and a return of capital.

People can life-annuitize their wealth in a variety of ways. Probably the most common is to purchase an immediate life annuity from a life insurance company, as explained in Chapter 17. Also, the decision to take a life income, rather than a lump sum settlement if available, from a pension plan is a decision to life-annuitize. Furthermore, entering into a charitable gift annuity involves a life annuity.

On the other hand, retirees can simply live off their actual current investment income and *preserve their capital* (investment portfolio). Their capital then would remain intact for future investment opportunities, cash needs, emergencies, inheritances for their heirs (the bequest motive), and possibly charitable giving.

In many cases, it may be logical to follow a combination of approaches. For example, in the case situation of Harry and Susan Wong discussed earlier, when they retire at age 70, they could use \$500,000 of their assets as the premium (annuity consideration) for an immediate joint and last survivor life annuity from a highly rated life insurance company. This might provide them with about an 8 percent return on the \$500,000 (\$40,000 per year) for their lifetimes. They then could preserve the \$1,000,000 and live off its investment income (or perhaps employ the "4% solution" for this amount).

Still another combination approach might be for Harry and Susan to begin their retirement by preserving their capital (the \$1,500,000 of assets) and using the investment income and perhaps some capital for living expenses. Then, some years later in their retirement, say, when they are 75 or 80, they can reevaluate the situation, and if they need more retirement income, they can purchase a joint and survivor life annuity with some of their capital. Because they are older, the rate of return on the annuity will be higher at this point.

### **Alternatives to Compensate for Projected Income (Cash-Flow) Shortfalls**

After a retirement-needs analysis, people may find that there is a shortfall or gap between their needs (or desires) and their present or projected retirement income. Filling this shortfall can present some difficult choices.

If the person or couple has not yet retired, several strategies may be followed, such as:

- N Increase saving for retirement. This may involve cutting current consumption expenditures. There is considerable evidence that in recent years, Americans in general have not been saving enough for retirement and other needs.
- N Review investment planning and asset allocation to see if investment yield can be improved within acceptable risk levels. The degree of investment risk also should be evaluated, considering the time left before planned retirement.
- N Consider contributing more to tax-advantaged retirement plans, if possible.
- N Perhaps postpone the planned retirement date (i.e., work longer).
- N If one spouse is not currently working outside the home but once had a career, perhaps he or she should consider returning to the workforce. In other words, become a two-earner family again.

However, if the person or couple is at retirement age or is retired, several strategies may present themselves to cover any shortfall, such as:

- N Try to reduce current expenses in retirement. For example, it may be possible to postpone planned trips or vacations. It also may be desirable to reduce or postpone planned giving programs to children or grandchildren. Other reductions may be possible without severely affecting the retirees' lifestyle.
- N Review investment planning and asset allocation, as just described.

### **Retirement Needs Analysis, Social Security, and Retirement Plans 311**

- N If possible, consider postponing the planned retirement date, or one or both spouses can return to active employment on a full- or part-time basis. This sometimes is referred to as "dynamic retirement planning." The problem is that at the very time the former retiree wants to return to work, the labor market may not be very receptive to the return of the older worker, particularly during a recession or depression.
- N As discussed previously, a strategy for increasing retirement income without undue risk is to devote capital to the purchase of an immediate life annuity from a highly rated life insurance company. For those who are charitably inclined, the creating of a charitable gift annuity also fits this strategy. However, the problem with life annuitization is that capital is not preserved and any bequest motive is impeded.
- N If the person or couple is eligible, they can take a reverse mortgage on their home, as described in Chapter 9. This, in effect, will convert the equity in their home into an income stream (analogous to a life annuity) but still leave the possibility of some of this equity going to their heirs after the last of their deaths. There are some limitations on reverse mortgages, however, as discussed in Chapter 9.

# **Social Security (OASDHI)**

Before considering in more detail the private approaches to providing retirement income, death benefits, disability benefits, and health benefits, it will be helpful to describe briefly the social insurance system for providing such benefits in the United States: Social Security.

### **Overview of Social Security**

While the bulk of Social Security benefits are paid as retirement benefits, the Social Security system (or old age, survivors, disability, and health insurance system, OASDHI) actually provides four distinct categories of benefits: *oldage* (retirement) benefits for covered workers and their eligible dependents, *survivors'* (death) benefits for eligible surviving dependents of covered workers, *disability* benefits for covered workers and their eligible dependents, and *health insurance* benefits (Medicare) for covered persons age 65 or older and certain other beneficiaries.

# **Coverage, Benefit Eligibility, and Social Security Taxes**

Almost everyone will be covered under the Social Security system and is paying or will pay social security taxes during their working years.

**Covered Persons** All employees and self-employed persons working in the United States and certain possessions are covered, except for a few groups specifically excluded by law.

**Insured Status** In addition to being a covered worker, a person's eligibility for benefits depends on having the appropriate insured status at the time of his or her retirement, disability, or death. There are three types of insured status requirements: fully insured, currently insured, and disability insured.

A worker attains *fully insured status* if he or she has 40 quarters of coverage. If not, he or she still may be fully insured by having a specified minimum number of quarters. A minimum of 6 quarters is required in any event.

A worker meets the requirements for *currently insured status* if he or she has at least 6 quarters of coverage during the 13 quarters ending with his or her death, eligibility for old-age benefits, or disability.

*Disability-insured status* has the strictest requirements of all. Workers who are age 31 or older when they become disabled must be fully insured and have at least 20 quarters of coverage during the 40-quarter period ending when their disabilities begin.

**Social Security Taxable Earnings Base (Covered Earnings) and Tax Rates** Covered earnings are those to which social security tax rates (FICA taxes) are applied and that also generally serve as a maximum in calculating a worker's average monthly earnings for purposes of determining his or her primary insurance amount.

For employees, all their compensation (up to the maximum, if any) from employment is subject to FICA tax. For self-employed persons, taxable compensation includes income from self-employment, which essentially means net earnings from operating an unincorporated trade or business as determined for federal income tax purposes.

The amount of the Social Security taxable earnings base (and benefit base) has constantly increased over the years, from a low of \$3,000 per year for 1937 through 1950 to \$106,800 for 2009. For the hospital insurance (HI) tax under Medicare, all compensation is taxable.1 This tax and benefit base will increase in the future in proportion to the increase in average annual wages in the United States.

1Beginning in 1994, the hospital insurance (HI) tax rate of 1.45 percent for employees and 2.90 percent for self-employed persons (which is included in the 7.65 percent and 15.30 percent totals here) is applied to a person's total taxable earnings or self-employment income. Thus, this HI tax effectively becomes an additional income tax on personal earnings (or self-employment income), with no maximum limit. It also effectively requires the annual valuation of amounts deferred under nonqualified deferred-compensation plans for highly compensated executives.

The total FICA tax rate for employees is 7.65 percent for 2009. There is an equal tax rate on employers. For self-employed persons, the FICA tax rate is 15.30 percent for 2009; however, one-half of this FICA tax is allowed as an income tax deduction from gross income, and self-employment income is reduced by 7.65 percent (without regard to the maximum earnings base) in determining taxable self-employment income.

**Primary Insurance Amount and Family Maximum Benefit** Social Security benefits (other than Medicare) are based on the worker's *primary insurance amount* (PIA). In turn, the *family maximum benefit* (FMB), which is the total amount of benefits that may be paid to a worker and his or her eligible dependents, also is determined based on the worker's PIA. A worker's PIA is calculated by applying a formula (which varies according to the year of eligibility for benefits) to the worker's average monthly earnings over a certain number of years.

Calculation of a person's or family's Social Security benefits is complicated. Fortunately, this complication is substantially diminished for planning purposes by personal earnings and benefit estimate statements (Social Security statements) available from the Social Security Administration. These statements are mailed each year to workers about three months before their birthday. (An additional copy can be secured from www.ssa.gov/ mystatement). In addition, the Social Security Administration maintains a Web site to help individuals determine their benefit amount at www.ssa.gov/ OACT/quickcalc.

# **Social Security Retirement Benefits**

**Retired Worker's Benefits** To be eligible for old-age benefits, a worker must be age 62 or older and have attained fully insured status. At the full-benefit retirement age (also called the Social Security normal retirement age or SSNRA), the retirement benefit is equal to the worker's PIA. For workers born in 1937 and earlier, the SSNRA was age 65. However, starting with workers born in 1938 and thereafter, the full-benefit retirement age gradually increases until it reaches age 67 for workers born in 1960 and later. As of this writing, the full-benefit retirement age for persons just eligible for Social Security is age 66. A covered worker may elect to receive a retirement benefit as early as age 62; however, if such an early-retirement benefit is elected, the worker's retirement benefit will be permanently reduced. For example, for retirees with an SSNRA of 66, the early retirement benefit starting at age 62 would be 75 percent of the full benefit at age 66. Workers can also elect to delay retirement until age 70, with increased benefits. After age 70, benefits are no longer increased by delay.

**Spouse of Retired Worker** The spouse of a retired worker who is at least age 62 is eligible to receive a lifetime retirement benefit based on the worker's PIA. For an eligible spouse at full-benefit retirement age, the spouse's benefit is equal to 50 percent of the covered worker's PIA. However, a spouse may begin receiving reduced retirement benefits as early as age 62. A divorced spouse also may be eligible for retirement benefits under certain conditions.

A spouse may be entitled to receive a Social Security retirement benefit because of the spouse's own employment record. When this occurs, the spouse will receive the larger of his or her own benefit or the benefit as a spouse, but not both.

**Other Dependents of Retired Workers** Social Security retirement benefits also may be available for a spouse caring for a child and for each eligible child or grandchild of a retired worker.

**Planning Issues Concerning When to Begin Taking Social Security Retirement Benefits** This may be a significant retirement planning issue. As just noted, an eligible worker and his or her eligible spouse can begin receiving reduced retirement benefits as early as age 62 or can delay them (with increased benefits) until age 70.

A number of considerations will affect when these benefits should be taken. If the covered worker and his or her spouse want to retire early, say around age 62, and need the benefits to live on, they probably should begin taking Social Security payments early (e.g., at age 62), even if these payments are reduced. This would be another alternative to compensate for a shortfall in other retirement benefits. Also, if the person is in poor health (and thus has a reduced life expectancy), it normally is better to begin benefits early, although the spouse's benefits also must be considered in this decision.

On the other hand, if the retirees stop working and can afford to delay taking Social Security benefits, they need to evaluate the financial results of delaying at least until full benefit age and perhaps even to age 70. The factors that might be considered in such a decision include:

- N The extent of the differences in benefits. For example, assuming the full benefit retirement age is 66 and the full benefit is \$2,000 per month, the corresponding benefit at age 62 would be \$1,500 per month (or 25 percent less), while the corresponding monthly benefit at age 70 would be \$2,640 (or 32 percent more).
- N The retiree's life expectancy.
- N The expected investment earnings rate on the benefits and the tax rate on those earnings.
- N The expected inflation rate.

#### **Retirement Needs Analysis, Social Security, and Retirement Plans 315**

Given such factors, a "break-even age" can be calculated, at which point the accumulated expected benefits for a person who delayed taking Social Security benefits (say, until SSNRA or age 70) will just equal and thereafter exceed the accumulated expected benefits for a person who began benefits early (say, at age 62). A government Web site at www.ssa.gov/retire2/ delayret.htm deals with delayed retirement decisions. Also, at the Social Security Administration's Web site (www.ssa.gov), there is a "break-even calculator" that can determine break-even ages.

It should also be noted that a retiree and his or her spouse can file separately for their respective benefits. For example, one spouse can file for a worker's benefit early and then the other spouse can file for a spouse's benefit at SSNRA (based on his or her worker spouse's projected benefit at the worker spouse's SSNRA).

**Personal Earnings While Receiving Social Security Retirement Benefits** At present, personal earnings after SSNRA retirement age do not reduce an otherwise eligible person's Social Security retirement benefits. However, if an early-retirement benefit is elected, the worker's benefit can be reduced for personal earnings until normal retirement age is reached.

**Cost-of-Living Increases in Social Security Benefits** Social Security is one of the few retirement programs that automatically increases benefits in the face of cost-of-living increases. All Social Security benefits (old-age, survivors', and disability) are increased each year when there has been an increase in the average consumer price index (CPI).

# **Social Security Survivorship (Death) Benefits**

These are benefits to certain survivors of deceased actively employed workers, disabled workers, or retired workers. They are based on the covered worker's primary insurance amount (PIA) and are paid in the form of monthly income to the eligible family member. In addition, there is a \$255 lumpsum death benefit to a surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, to eligible children.

### **Surviving Spouse**

The surviving spouse of a deceased worker who had a fully insured status can receive a survivor's benefit, provided the surviving spouse is age 60 or older, or is disabled, and at least 50. The amount of this benefit is 100 percent of the deceased worker's survivor PIA**,** if the surviving spouse has reached the full-benefit retirement age**,** and is reduced for younger surviving spouses.

#### **Other Dependents**

Unmarried children (and, in certain circumstances, unmarried grandchildren) of a deceased worker are entitled to a child's monthly survivor's benefit. This benefit is equal to 75 percent of the deceased parent's PIA, provided the child is under age 18, under age 19 and an elementary or secondary school student, or 18 or older but disabled before age 22.

In addition, the surviving spouse of a deceased worker is eligible for a *mother's or father's survivor's benefit* equal to 75 percent of the deceased worker's PIA as long as the surviving spouse is caring for an eligible child who is under age 16 or is older and disabled before reaching age 22. The surviving spouse is eligible for the benefit at any age. A surviving divorced spouse also may be eligible for this benefit. Further, a surviving *dependent parent* who is at least 62 years old may be entitled to a monthly survivor's benefit.

As is the case for other Social Security benefits, there is a family maximum benefit (FMB) that applies to the combined survivor's benefits from the PIA of a deceased worker.

### **Social Security Disability Benefits**

There are two kinds of Social Security disability benefits: cash disability income benefits, payable to the disabled worker and his or her eligible dependents, and freezing of a disabled worker's wage position for purposes of determining his or her future retirement or survivorship benefits.

An eligible worker is considered disabled when he or she has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is so severe that the worker is unable to engage in any substantially gainful work or employment. This amounts to an "any occupation" definition of disability and is strict by health insurance standards. In addition, the disability must last 5 months before benefits can begin. After 5 months of disability, benefits are payable, if the impairment can be expected to last for at least 12 months or to result in death, or if it has actually lasted 12 months. This amounts to a 5-month waiting (elimination) period.

### **Taxation of Social Security Benefits**

The Social Security Amendments of 1983 introduced a previously unthinkable concept: the taxing of Social Security benefits.

The first step is to determine whether any of a person's or couple's benefits will be subject to tax. This will occur if their so-called provisional income exceeds certain base amounts. Provisional income is the sum of (1) 50 percent of the Social Security benefit payable; (2) the person's or couple's adjusted gross income (AGI) for federal income tax purposes (with certain additions); and (3) tax-exempt interest (from municipal bonds2 ). If this provisional income does not exceed \$25,000 for a single taxpayer or \$32,000 for a married couple filing a joint return, Social Security benefits remain tax-free.

In the second step, if provisional income exceeds the appropriate base amount but does not exceed \$34,000 for a single taxpayer or \$44,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return, the amount of benefits includible in gross income is the smaller of one-half the Social Security benefits or one-half the excess of provisional income over the base amount.

Finally, in the third step, if provisional income exceeds \$34,000 for a single taxpayer or \$44,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return, the amount includible in gross income is the smaller of 85 percent of Social Security benefits or the sum of (1) the smaller of the amount calculated in the second step or \$4,500 for a single taxpayer or \$6,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return; and (2) 85 percent of the amount by which provisional income exceeds \$34,000 for a single taxpayer or \$44,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return. Thus, higher-income taxpayers could be taxed on as much as 85 percent of their Social Security benefits. Fortunately, the IRS Forms and Instructions booklet contains a worksheet to help taxpayers determine the taxable amount, if any, of their Social Security benefits.

# **Characteristics of Employer-Provided Retirement Plans**

Employer-provided retirement plans are part of the employer's overall employee benefits program. The most important are *qualified pension plans, profit-sharing plans,* and *savings plans.* However, employers also may have other plans that aid their employees or some of their employees in providing for retirement. Some of these include simplified employee pension plans (SEPs), tax-sheltered annuity (TSA) plans for nonprofit and certain other employers, qualified stock bonus plans, qualified employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), savings incentive match plans for employees of small employers (SIMPLE) plans, nonqualified deferred-compensation plans, and supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs).

# **Qualified Retirement Plans**

The phrase *qualified retirement plan* is a tax term and refers to those kinds of retirement plans spelled out in the Internal Revenue Code (Section 401[a])

<sup>2</sup>The sum of a person's or couple's regular adjusted gross income, with certain additions, and their tax-exempt interest is referred to as their *modified adjusted gross income* (or modified AGI) in this calculation.

that are accorded special tax advantages if they meet certain nondiscrimination and other requirements of the law. Some of the important qualification requirements for these plans can be summarized as follows:

- N There must be a legally binding arrangement that is in writing and communicated to the employees.
- N The plan must be for the exclusive benefit of the employees or their beneficiaries.
- N The principal or income of the plan must not be diverted from these benefits for any other purpose.
- N The plan must benefit a broad class of employees and not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.
- N The plan must meet certain minimum vesting requirements.
- N Plans must meet minimum eligibility, coverage, and participation requirements.
- N Plans must provide certain spousal rights in benefits.
- N There must be certain minimum benefit distribution rules.
- N Plans must meet minimum funding standards.

The qualified plans covered in this chapter include:

- N Pension plans
- N Profit-sharing plans
- N Savings (or thrift) plans
- N Cash or deferred arrangements (Section 401[k] options)
- N Stock bonus plans
- N Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)
- N Retirement plans for the self-employed (HR-10 or Keogh plans)

### **Advantages and Limitations of Qualified Plans**

Some commentators have referred to qualified retirement plans as the "perfect tax shelter." While there probably is no perfect tax shelter, qualified retirement plans do have significant tax and nontax advantages.

### **Tax Advantages of Qualified Plans** These include the following:

- N Employer contributions, within the limits of the tax law, are deductible for income tax purposes by the employer.
- N Even though the employer receives a current income tax deduction, covered employees (called participants) do not receive taxable income from the plan due to employer contributions until benefits are actually distributed to the participants or their beneficiaries.
- N Investment income or gains on assets within the plan are not subject to income taxation until paid out as benefits.

- N Employees may be able to contribute to some plans with before-tax dollars (i.e., on a salary-reduction basis).
- N Lump-sum distributions to participants (or their beneficiaries) may be given favorable income tax treatment under limited circumstances.
- N Under a special grandfather provision, certain amounts payable upon the death of a plan participant may be entitled to either an unlimited or a \$100,000 estate tax exclusion, depending on when the participant (decedent) separated from the employer's service. In general, however, there no longer is an estate tax exclusion for qualified plan death benefits as there once was.

**Other Advantages of Qualified Plans** In addition to these tax advantages, qualified plans may have the following nontax advantages for participants:

- N The employer may pay the full cost of a plan (a noncontributory plan) or part of the cost (a contributory plan).
- N Plans may have favorable investment options that are not available to persons outside the plan.
- N If the plan is contributory, regular employee contributions by way of payroll deduction (on either a before-tax or after-tax basis) may be a convenient way for employees to save.
- N Plans often have loan provisions that permit participants to borrow from the plan.

**Limitations of Qualified Plans** However, there may be drawbacks to these plans from the participants' point of view.

- N The rights to benefits of participants who leave the employer before retirement are subject to the terms of the plan. Therefore, the particular plan's provisions will determine when and how a participant can receive benefits from the plan.
- N Investment options under some plans may be limited.
- N The rights of participants to benefits attributable to the employer's contributions are determined by the vesting provisions of the plan.
- N A participant's rights to distributions from qualified retirement plans are subject to certain spousal (marital) rights under the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA), as described in the section "Impact of Marital Rights on Qualified Retirement Plans."
- N Since qualified retirement plans are intended to provide retirement income for participants, if premature distributions are taken from qualified plans (as well as from IRAs and certain other plans), the distributions will be subject to a 10 percent penalty tax in addition to the regular income tax on the distribution. Premature distributions are described in Chapter 16, but they generally are those prior to age 59½, subject to certain exceptions.

#### **320 Part V. Retirement Planning and Other Employee Benefits**

- N Correspondingly, since these plans are intended to provide retirement income for participants and their spouses rather than income tax–deferred wealth transfers, benefits from these plans (as well as from traditional IRAs) must begin by a participant's required beginning date (RBD), which often is age 70½, and at least minimum distributions must be taken starting at the RBD. These minimum distribution rules are explained more fully in Chapter 16.
- N Death benefits from these plans are included in a participant's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes (except for a few grandfathered cases) and are also income in respect of a decedent (IRD). Hence, they are heavily taxed at death.
- N The structuring and administration of the plan and selection of funding agencies (e.g., banks or insurance companies) and other third-party service providers normally is up to the employer.
- N Finally, the employer can modify or terminate the plan for the future, unless it is subject to collective bargaining.

On balance, however, the advantages of qualified retirement plans far outweigh possible drawbacks, so employees usually are well advised to participate fully in such plans.

### **Defined-Benefit and Defined-Contribution Plans**

Qualified retirement plans can be classified as either defined-benefit plans or defined-contribution plans. This distinction can be important in planning for these plans.

A *defined-benefit (DB) plan* is one in which the retirement benefits are expressed as a specified benefit at retirement. The benefit may be a dollar amount or it may be determined by a formula specified in the plan. Thus, the essence of a DB plan is that the retirement benefits are specified or fixed, while the contributions necessary to fund those benefits vary. The type of DB plan with which most people are concerned is the *defined-benefit pension plan.*

A *defined-contribution (DC) plan,* on the other hand, is one that provides for an individual account for each participant and for specified or variable contributions being made to those accounts. These plans are sometimes called *individual account plans.* The accumulated account balance for a participant may be affected by such factors as contributions to the account (by the employer, the employee, or both), investment income, investment gains and losses from the assets in the account, and possible forfeitures by other plan participants that may be allocated to the account. A participant's retirement income from a DC plan, then, is based on the income or other distributions the participant's accumulated account balance will produce at his

or her retirement age, depending on how benefits are taken from the plan. Some pension plans, called *money-purchase pension plans,* are DC plans. All the other types of qualified plans discussed in this chapter also are DC plans. Some people have both DB and DC plans from their employers. However, others will have only one type, usually a DC plan.

# **Impact of Marital Rights on Qualified Retirement Plans**

There have been significant changes in the law concerning the rights of noncovered spouses (also called nonparticipant spouses or NPSs) in the retirement plan benefits of their covered spouses. These rights can significantly affect retirement and estate planning by married persons.

**Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA)** The purpose of REA is to give a noncovered spouse certain survivorship rights in the qualified retirement plan benefits of the covered spouse, unless those rights are waived by the covered spouse, with the proper witnessed consent in writing by the noncovered spouse. REA essentially mandates two forms of survivorship benefits to protect the noncovered spouse: a preretirement spouse's benefit, called a *qualified preretirement survivor annuity* (QPSA), and a postretirement spouse's benefit, called a *qualified joint and survivor annuity* (QJSA).

**Plans Covered by REA Rules** REA applies to qualified defined-benefit and money-purchase pension plans. It also covers qualified profit-sharing (including savings) and stock bonus plans, unless these plans meet certain requirements for exclusion from the rules. In general, to be excepted from REA, a participant's benefit arrangement under a profit-sharing, savings, or stock bonus plan must meet the following requirements: First, the participant's vested account balance must be payable in full upon the participant's death to his or her surviving spouse (unless the spouse consents in the proper form to another beneficiary designation, as noted subsequently). Second, the participant cannot elect for benefits to be payable in the form of a life annuity. And, third, the plan cannot have received a transfer from a pension plan. In effect, then, if an employee covered under a profit-sharing, savings, or stock bonus plan wishes to have the death benefit payable in any way other than outright to his or her spouse, the spouse must consent to the other beneficiary designation in the proper form, or else the spouse's REA rights will apply.

It may be noted that the REA rules do not apply to IRAs.

**Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity (QPSA)** A QPSA is a life annuity for the surviving spouse of a plan participant who had a vested benefit in the plan and who dies before his or her normal retirement benefits are to begin. If the participant dies after the earliest age at which retirement benefits could have been received under the plan, the surviving spouse's QPSA is the amount that would have been payable to the surviving spouse under an annuity form of a lifetime income for the employee, with a 50 percent survivorship annuity for the spouse, assuming the deceased employee had actually retired with such an annuity on the day before his or her death.

### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose Mary Warnaki is age 56, married, and participates in a pension plan that has a normal retirement age of 65 but permits early retirement as soon as age 55. Mary's husband is age 58. If Mary were to retire at her current age of 56, she and her husband would receive a joint and 50-percent-to-the-survivor pension benefit of \$2,000 per month. Given these facts, if Mary (while actively employed) dies at age 56 with her husband surviving, her husband will receive a QPSA benefit of \$1,000 per month (\$2,000 × 50 percent) for his life.

If an employee dies before the earliest age at which he or she could have retired under the plan, the calculation is more complex but the principle is essentially the same. In this case, the surviving spouse must wait until when the deceased employee would have attained the plan's early retirement age to begin receiving his or her QPSA benefit.

REA permits an employer to charge the increased cost of QPSA rights against the retirement benefits that otherwise would be payable to the participant. However, an employer voluntarily may not reduce the benefits otherwise payable.

A participant may decide to waive these QPSA benefits. For QPSA rights only, this can be done at any time during an election period, which generally begins after a participant attains age 35. A waiver is not effective unless the participant's spouse consents in writing and the consent is witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public. A significant planning issue is whether a participant and his or her spouse should elect to waive these rights. This issue is considered further in the next section.

**Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA)** REA also requires that qualified plan retirement benefits payable to a married participant must be provided as a QJSA, unless the participant (with the consent of his or her spouse) elects to waive the QJSA form or unless a profit-sharing, savings, or stock bonus plan account meets the requirements for exclusion from the REA rules. The QJSA form is an annuity for the lifetime of the participant, with a survivorship annuity for the lifetime of his or her surviving spouse of not less than 50 percent, or more than 100 percent, of the annuity payable during their joint lives.

### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume that Henry Sullivan is married, age 65, and about to retire under his employer's defined-benefit pension plan. His wife also is age 65. Assume further that Henry does not elect to waive the QJSA form and so retires with an annuity benefit payable under a 50-percent QJSA form of \$6,000 per month. Given these facts, if Henry should predecease his wife, a survivorship annuity would continue to her of \$3,000 per month for the remainder of her lifetime (\$6,000 × 50 percent). On the other hand, if Henry's wife should predecease him, the original \$6,000 per month would continue for his lifetime.

As with QPSA rights, REA permits a plan to charge the increased cost against the pension benefits otherwise payable. Just as an example, one pension plan applies a reduction factor of 10.7 percent from the life annuity for the participant alone (a straight life annuity) for a QJSA form, when both the participant and spouse are age 65. However, again, an employer may voluntarily subsidize the QJSA form.

A plan participant, with the consent in the proper form of his or her spouse, may elect to waive the QJSA form within an election period, which is the 90-day period before retirement benefits are to begin. As with the QPSA form, whether a married participant and his or her spouse should elect to waive the QJSA form is an important planning issue.

One reason for considering such a waiver is to avoid reduction of retirement benefits during the joint lifetimes of the husband and wife. Of course, if the forms are subsidized by the employer, this reason is gone and the plan probably will not allow for a waiver. The couple may also desire a retirement payment other than a QJSA, such as a lump-sum payment from a pension plan. Furthermore, there may be estate planning reasons for a waiver if it is desirable for a plan's death benefits to be payable other than outright to the surviving spouse, such as to a trust, for example.

Balanced against these factors, however, is the loss of the protection of the survivorship feature for the nonparticipant spouse in the event he or she survives the participant. This really is part of the broader planning issue of how to protect the surviving spouse. A significant factor in dealing with this issue is the amount of life insurance on the retired employee's life that continues into retirement for the protection of the nonparticipant spouse.

Finally, if a waiver is to be used, the nonparticipant spouse may want to consider the terms and extent of the waiver and of his or her consent. For example, is the consent revocable or irrevocable? Is it general so that the participant can name any beneficiary he or she wishes or later change the beneficiary, or is it specific (limited) to the beneficiary named when the consent was given? And if a trust is named, can the participant later change the trust beneficiaries?

**Other Marital Rights** The domestic relations laws of most states recognize that a noncovered spouse may have certain marital property rights in retirement plan benefits and other employee benefits of a spouse in the event of separation or divorce. Under equitable distribution of property laws, retirement plan rights often are considered *marital property* and thus are subject to equitable division between the spouses upon separation or divorce.

These marital and child support rights may be enforced through presenting a *qualified domestic relations order* (QDRO) to the plan administrator. A QDRO is a domestic relations order, issued by a court or other appropriate authority, that recognizes the rights of alternative payees to part or all of a participant's benefits under a qualified retirement plan. Alternate payees may be a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of the plan participant. Assuming the order meets the requirements for a valid QDRO, the plan administrator must make the proper payments of benefits to the alternative payee(s) when the benefits otherwise would have been payable to the participant.

Also, in states that have community property laws or similar laws, the rights that a covered spouse accumulates in various employer-provided plans during marriage become community property and hence each spouse owns half.

### **Loans from Qualified Plans**

Many qualified retirement plans (particularly profit-sharing and savings plans) contain loan provisions that allow participants to borrow from the plan. Such plan loans are not considered taxable distributions from the plan as long as the requirements of the tax law are observed.

The law specifies that for loans not to be considered taxable distributions, the loan may not exceed the smaller of \$50,000 or one-half the present value of the participant's vested benefits in the plan. However, loans of less than \$10,000 are not treated as taxable distributions, regardless of these limits. The law also requires that a loan be repaid within five years in substantially level payments made at least quarterly. There is an exception to this rule for plan loans used to acquire a primary residence. They must be repaid only within a reasonable time. Loans must also bear a "reasonable" interest rate.

### **Limitations on Contributions and Benefits for Qualified Plans**

**Section 415 Limits** Under these limits (found in Section 415 of the IRC), for 2009, annual employer-provided pension benefits under a defined-benefit pension plan may not exceed the lesser of \$195,000 (adjusted for inflation in increments of \$5,000) or 100 percent of the participant's average annual compensation for his or her three highest consecutive years of compensation in the plan. There is actuarial reduction of this dollar limit only if the participant retires before age 62. Furthermore, for 2009, annual additions for a participant under a defined-contribution plan may not exceed the lesser of \$49,000 (adjusted for inflation in increments of \$1,000) or 100 percent of the participant's annual compensation. Many employers provide that if an employee's benefits under the regular benefit formula exceed the Section 415 limits, the employer will pay the difference from an unfunded nonqualified retirement plan (called an *excess benefits plan*).

**Limits for Section 401(k) Plans** Special limitations applying to Section 401(k) plans. are described later in this chapter.

**Limits on Tax-Deductible Employer Contributions** The tax law also places limits on the amount an employer or a self-employed person can deduct in a given year for contributions to various types of qualified retirement plans.

*Defined-Benefit Plans:* The annual deductible limit for these plans is the amount needed to fund the benefits provided under the plan according to reasonable funding methods and actuarial assumptions adopted by the employer or self-employed person. Furthermore, an employer may deduct at least the amount needed to meet the minimum funding requirements for the current year.

The overall effect of these rules is that defined-benefit pension plans (particularly with permitted disparity, as described later) may generate relatively large tax-deductible contributions for an employer or self-employed person on behalf of older, more highly compensated participants*.* This can be attractive for owner–employees of closely held businesses or self-employed persons because they often are older, are more highly compensated, and have longer tenures of service than other employees of the business.

However, the tax law and ERISA specify certain minimum funding requirements for defined-benefit plans that an employer or a self-employed

### **326 Part V. Retirement Planning and Other Employee Benefits**

person must meet. This means an employer may have to make contributions to a DB plan in bad times as well as good. Thus, DB pension plans create *funding rigidity* for the employer or self-employed person that is not present for profit-sharing plans.

*Money-Purchase Pension Plans:* As DC plans, the maximum annual deductible employer contribution is 25 percent of aggregate compensation of participants under the plan. Also, since these are pension plans, the employer or self-employed person must make contributions each year, whether the firm is profitable or not.

*Profit-Sharing and Stock Bonus Plans:* For these DC plans, the maximum aggregate annual tax-deductible employer contributions also cannot exceed 25 percent of total compensation paid to participants for the year. Furthermore, contributions to profit-sharing plans normally are discretionary on the part of the employer, and hence, can be made when the employer feels financially able to do so, but cannot be made when the reverse is true. Thus, the employer has greater funding flexibility under profit-sharing plans as compared with moneypurchase pension plans. Since the same 25 percent aggregate limit on taxdeductible employer contributions now applies to both types of plans, most commentators believe few employers will adopt money-purchase pension plans.

*Other Plans:* There are a number of other types of retirement plans for which there may be limits on contributions. They include Section 401(k) plans, SIMPLE plans, ESOPs, target benefit plans, SEPs, and various kinds of IRAs. The limits on contributions to these plans are covered in this and subsequent chapters.

**Limit on Includible Compensation** There is a limit (indexed for inflation in \$5,000 increments) for qualified retirement plans on the amount of a participant's annual compensation that can be taken into account in determining contributions to or benefits from the plan.3 This is referred to as the *compensation cap.* As of 2009, the limit stands at \$245,000.

# **Vesting Under Qualified Plans**

*Vesting* means that a participant has a nonforfeitable right in his or her account balance under a defined-contribution plan or to an accrued benefit under a defined-benefit plan that results from employer contributions to the plan. A participant has a right to his or her vested benefits, regardless of whether or not the participant stays with the employer.

<sup>3</sup>This maximum annual compensation limit also applies to simplified employee pensions (SEPs), tax-sheltered annuities (TSAs), and voluntary employee beneficiary associations (VEBAs), as well as to qualified retirement plans.

#### **Retirement Needs Analysis, Social Security, and Retirement Plans 327**

Vesting can take several forms. Immediate and 100 percent vesting is, of course, the most liberal from the participating employee's standpoint. However, most private plans do not provide immediate and 100 percent vesting. The other form is deferred vesting, which is the most common.

Qualified retirement plans are required to meet certain minimum vesting standards. For defined-benefit plans, vesting must be at least as rapid as under one of two alternative minimum vesting schedules: (1)100 percent vesting upon the participant's completion of five years of service (referred to as *cliff vesting*); or (2) graded or graduated vesting at the rate of 20 percent after three years of service, 40 percent after four years, 60 percent after five years, 80 percent after six years, and 100 percent after seven years or more of service. For defined-contribution plans, there are more rapid minimum vesting schedules for employer contributions, which are 100 percent after three years of service for cliff vesting; or graded vesting at the rate of 20 percent after two years of service, 40 percent after three years, 60 percent after four years, 80 percent after five years, and 100 percent after six or more years of service.

Vesting, particularly cliff vesting, will eliminate benefits for short-service employees. This may be beneficial for plans covering owner-employers of closely held businesses.

Naturally, under contributory plans where employees pay part of the cost, participants are always entitled to a refund (or the right to a deferred benefit) of their own contributions to the plan upon termination of employment.

### **Integration (Permitted Disparity) with Social Security**

**General Considerations** An *integrated plan* is one in which either benefits or contributions under Social Security are taken into account in establishing the benefits or contributions under the plan. This concept is now referred to in the tax law as *permitted disparity*.

The permitted disparity (integration) rules set limits on the extent to which a qualified plan's benefits or contributions on employee compensation above a compensation level assumed for Social Security purposes (called the *integration level*) can exceed plan benefits or contributions for compensation at or below that level. These limits differ for DB plans and DC plans. However, integration may result in larger relative benefits for higher paid employees (like owner–employees of closely held businesses, for example). Of course, a plan does not have to be integrated with Social Security at all. Some qualified plans are not so integrated. In this case, the permitted disparity rules are not relevant.

**Integration of Defined-Benefit Plans** There are two basic methods used to integrate DB plans: the excess method and the offset method. An *excess plan*  is one under which there is a smaller benefit payable on earnings up to the Social Security integration level than on earnings above that level. An *offset plan* is one under which a pension benefit is calculated without regard to Social Security benefits, and then a percentage of the Social Security benefit is usually deducted from the pension benefit.

**Integration of Defined-Contribution Plans** DC plans are integrated based on contribution percentages to the plan. A plan will meet the integration rules if the plan's excess contribution percentage (the contribution percentage applying to compensation in excess of the plan's Social Security integration level) does not exceed the lesser of (1) 200 percent of the contribution percentage on compensation not in excess of the plan's integration level (base contribution percentage) or, (2) the greater of the base contribution percentage plus 5.7 percent or the base contribution percentage plus the portion of the employer-paid social security tax attributable to the old-age benefit.

### **CASE EXAMPLE**

As an example of how integration might work in the context of a small employer, suppose that Aysha Ahmed is the 100 percent stockholder and CEO of a small C corporation—AA Corporation, Inc. Aysha receives an annual salary of \$260,000. The corporation has three other employees with annual compensations of \$60,000, \$35,000, and \$25,000. AA has a discretionary qualified profitsharing plan covering the four employees, with an integrated contribution formula of 10 percent of each covered employee's compensation, up to the Social Security wage base (the integration level in this case), and 15.7 percent of each covered employee's compensation over that amount, up to the compensation cap for qualified plans. The contributions under this formula for a given year are shown in Table 13.1.

### **Top-Heavy Retirement Plans**

Some qualified retirement plans are defined as top-heavy and must meet special requirements for qualification. The idea behind these requirements is to try to avoid discrimination in favor of certain employees and to protect lowerpaid employees in plans in which a high proportion of benefits or contributions is actually being allocated to participants defined as *key employees.*<sup>4</sup>

<sup>4</sup>A *key employee* for this purpose is any participant who is an officer of the employer with annual compensation greater than 50 percent of the Section 415 dollar limit for DB plans, a more than 5 percent owner of the employer, or a more than 1 percent owner of the employer who has annual compensation from the employer of more than \$160,000 in 2009.

**Table 13.1.** Example of Integration of Profit-Sharing Plan with Social Security

\*The limit on includible compensation (compensation cap) in 2009 was \$245,000 per year. Therefore, this is all that can be counted for Aysha for plan contribution (or benefit) purposes.

† This was the Social Security taxable wage base for 2009.

A plan is considered top-heavy with respect to any plan year if, in the case of a DB plan, the present value of the cumulative accrued benefits for key employees exceeds 60 percent of the corresponding value for all employees or, in the case of a DC plan, the aggregate accounts of the key employees exceed 60 percent of the aggregate accounts of all employees. Thus, for example, the integrated profit-sharing plan in the preceding example would be top-heavy for the year, assuming the contributions shown in Table 13.1 represent the account balances for all covered employees. Aysha is a key employee, while the others are not. Her \$32,377 account balance is more than 60 percent of the aggregate accounts of all covered employees. The additional requirements that must be met by a plan classified as top-heavy include a minimum vesting schedule and minimum employer contributions or benefits for nonkey employees for top-heavy plan years.

# **Regulation of Qualified Retirement Plans**

The main federal statute regulating employee benefit plans is the *Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)*. It covers many areas, including reporting, disclosure, participation, and vesting requirements, funding standards, fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transactions, antidiscrimination rules, limitations on contributions and benefits, benefit accruals, limitations on distributions, spousal annuities, and others. The federal regulatory agency for part of ERISA (the so-called labor title—Title I) is the Department of Labor (DOL). However, since retirement plans must meet the requirements of the tax law to be qualified plans, they are also regulated under the IRC. (These tax provisions are also Title II of ERISA.) Thus, there is concurrent jurisdiction over qualified plan regulation by the IRS and the DOL.

Another important piece of federal legislation regulating retirement plans and other employee benefits is the *Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA)*. This law covers a number of subjects, including minimum funding requirements, investment and fiduciary rules, vesting requirements, plan distribution and rollover rules, automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans, and others.

In addition, many other federal laws regulate or affect retirement plans. For example, the *Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA)* deals with spousal rights in qualified retirement plans, as explained earlier in this chapter.

These federal statutes preempt state regulation related to these aspects of employee benefits.

### **Fiduciary Liability Issue**

ERISA sets standards of conduct for certain individuals who manage employee benefit plans and their investments (fiduciary responsibility rules). Such persons are known as *ERISA fiduciaries*, and they have discretion in administering or managing some or all of a plan's operations or controlling its assets. A plan must have at least one fiduciary named in the plan, but also may have other fiduciaries who exercise discretion over the plan's affairs. These other fiduciaries may include members of a plan's administrative committee (if any), human resources department employees, or third-party service providers who manage the plan's day-to-day operations; plan trustees; investment advisers; and other individuals exercising discretion over the plan's operations.

On the other hand, professionals like attorneys, accountants, and actuaries normally are not fiduciaries when acting solely within their professional capacities. Also, employers making business decisions about the plan are not acting in a fiduciary capacity. Such business decisions might include, for example, whether to establish the plan, the nature of the benefit package, amending the plan, and whether to terminate the plan.

Fiduciaries have certain responsibilities to the plan, its participants, and their beneficiaries, including:

- N To act solely in the interest of the plan participants and their beneficiaries
- N To carry out their duties prudently
- N To follow the plan documents so long as they are consistent with ERISA
- N To diversify plan investments
- N To pay only reasonable plan expenses

#### **Retirement Needs Analysis, Social Security, and Retirement Plans 331**

Fiduciaries who do not prudently conform to these responsibility standards may be personally liable to the plan. They may have to personally reimburse the plan for any losses due to their actions and may have to restore to the plan any profits made through improper use of plan assets due to their actions.

However, fiduciaries can take certain actions to protect themselves from potential liability. One is to carefully document the processes they employ to prudently carry out their fiduciary responsibilities. Another is to follow DOL regulations with respect to providing investment options (at least three), so employees can diversify their investments under participant-directed accounts, such as in 401(k) plans. If the DOL regulations are followed, a fiduciary's liability will be avoided for the investment decisions made by participants. However, fiduciaries still have the responsibility (and potential liability) for prudently selecting the investment options themselves, their providers, and for monitoring their performance. In addition, a fiduciary can hire third-party service providers to perform fiduciary functions and provide in their agreement that the service providers will assume liability for those functions. Of course, the fiduciary remains responsible for the prudent selection and monitoring of the third-party providers. Finally, there is liability insurance coverage, called fiduciary liability insurance or ERISA liability insurance, that employers can purchase to reimburse their fiduciaries for potential liability.

### **Prohibited Transactions**

Certain ERISA-specific actions are prohibited for fiduciaries and others connected to a plan. Certain parties, called *parties-in-interest*, who include the employer; the union (if any); plan fiduciaries; service providers; and specified owners, officers, and relatives of parties-in-interest, are prohibited from doing business with the plan, unless an exemption applies. Specifically, some of these prohibited transactions include:

- N A sale, exchange, or lease between the plan and a party-in-interest
- N Lending money or another extension of credit between the plan and a party-in-interest
- N Furnishing goods, services, or facilities between the plan and a party-ininterest

In addition, there are other prohibited transactions relating solely to fiduciaries. For example, fiduciaries are prohibited from using plan assets in their own interests, from acting on both sides of a transaction involving the plan, and from receiving money or other consideration from any party doing business with the plan related to that business.

### **332 Part V. Retirement Planning and Other Employee Benefits**

ERISA spells out a number of exemptions to these prohibited transaction rules. One exemption allows plans to hire service providers for the plan so long as the services are necessary and the contract terms and compensation paid for them are reasonable. Another important exemption allows qualified plans to provide plan loans to participants (who normally would include some parties-in-interest). However, such loans must be available to all participants and meet certain other requirements, as noted previously. Still another exemption covers investment advice provided to participants by fiduciary advisers, as described later in this chapter.

### **Reporting Requirements**

ERISA requires plan administrators to provide certain documents and reports to plan participants, beneficiaries, and the government. For plan participants and beneficiaries, the law requires:

- N A summary plan description (SPD), which basically describes the plan and explains to participants their rights and responsibilities under it.
- N A summary of material modification (SMM), which informs participants and beneficiaries of significant changes to the plan.
- N An individual benefit statement that provides participants with information concerning their vested benefits and account balances. For single employer plans, such statements must be provided upon written request and upon termination of employment. However, some employers voluntarily provide such statements periodically to employee-participants.
- N A summary annual report (SAR), which outlines financial information from the plan's Annual Report (Form 5500) and is furnished annually to participants.
- N A blackout period notice informing participants when the plan is temporarily closed to participant transactions (such as when the plan changes record keepers or investment options).

ERISA requires plan administrators to file Form 5500 Annual Reports providing specified information about the plan and its operations to the appropriate federal agencies. These include the DOL, IRS, and the PBGC.

# **Investment Considerations for Retirement Plans**

The assets of retirement plans are frequently held in trust funds. Retirement benefits can also be funded through insurance contracts. The regulatory standards for the investment of qualified retirement plan assets are provided by ERISA.

### **Suitability and Diversification**

ERISA requires *prudent investing* of qualified plan assets. It also requires diversification of plan investments. Retirement plans generally are long-term undertakings, so a long *time horizon* can be assumed in their investment policies.

The so-called prudence norm for retirement plan investing has become the *prudent investor standard*. Court decisions and DOL regulations have recognized this standard for retirement plan investing. The prudent investor standard applies modern portfolio theory (MPT) by considering the riskreturn characteristics and correlations of an entire portfolio rather than the riskiness of individual investments taken alone, as explained in Chapter 4.

As noted earlier, prudent investing and diversification may be fiduciary responsibilities of ERISA fiduciaries.

### **Individual Account [404(c)] Regulations**

Many individual account plans, such as 401(k) plans and profit-sharing plans, allow participants or beneficiaries to make investment decisions (exercise control) regarding their account balances among a group of investment alternatives provided by the plan. These are referred to as "participantdirected plans" or "ERISA Section 404(c) plans."

As noted earlier, ERISA provides in Section 404(c) that no plan fiduciary will be liable for investment losses due to this participant control, provided the individual account plan complies with DOL regulations, referred to as the individual account regulations or 404(c) regulations. These regulations require that the plan provide a minimum of three diversified investment alternatives, with materially different risk-return characteristics, so the participant can achieve an appropriate portfolio for himself or herself. If the plan permits investment in employer securities, this must be an additional alternative; it cannot be one of the minimum three because employer securities are not diversified. Also, participants must be allowed to change among the alternatives at least quarterly.

### **Investment Advice Provided to Participants by Fiduciary Advisers**

A significant provision of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) provides a new prohibited transaction exemption allowing certain qualified "fiduciary advisers" to provide investment advice to plan participants and beneficiaries of 401(k) and other defined-contribution plans and to beneficiaries of IRAs. The investment advice may be specifically tailored to such participants and may be offered through "eligible investment advice arrangements" (i.e., generated from an unbiased computer model or provided for a flat fee that does not vary depending on the investment options chosen). Thus, through such an arrangement, an employer can offer individualized professional investment advice to its employees covered by these plans.

### **Employer Securities in Qualified Plans**

Under certain conditions, qualified plans can invest in the securities of the employer sponsoring the plan. Employer securities include stock and debt obligations of the employer, but such investments normally involve common stock.

Employer stock often is an investment option under participant-directed plans [e.g., 401(k) plans]. Also, employers may place their matching contributions to 401(k) plans in their own stock. Thus, part of an employee's account balance in such plans may be invested in his or her employer's stock. In some cases, this investment in employer stock is substantial.

For defined-benefit pension plans (and money-purchase plans), ERISA generally prohibits the plan from holding more than 10 percent of its assets in employer securities. However, in the case of other defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans and profit-sharing plans, there generally is no such limit, provided the plan document allows such investments. Stock bonus plans and ESOPs are intended to be invested in employer securities, as noted later in this chapter.

The PPA of 2006 includes certain diversification requirements for plan investments in employer securities in defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans. In the case of employee contributions and elective deferrals invested in employer securities, participants and beneficiaries with accounts under the plan must be allowed to direct the plan to divest the employer securities from their accounts and reinvest the proceeds in other investment options as they choose. With respect to employer contributions (e.g., employer-matching contributions) invested in employer securities, participants with at least three years of service or beneficiaries similarly must be allowed to direct the plan to divest employer securities and reinvest the proceeds in other options.

These ERISA and IRC diversification requirements, added by PPA, are valuable for participants and beneficiaries to allow them to balance (diversify) their overall investment portfolios and not become unduly concentrated in their employer's stock. Such overconcentration may be a problem in some cases due to stock option plans, restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans, and other employer stock plans, as well as the natural tendency of many employees to be loyal to their company's stock and think of it as a "good investment." On the other hand, it should be remembered that there may be tax advantages in taking a lump-sum distribution in one taxable year of an entire account balance containing appreciated employer securities from a qualified plan. This is discussed in Chapter 16. However, in most cases, it is questionable whether such possible tax advantages will justify investment overconcentration (including retirement plans) in employer securities.

# **Unrelated Business Taxable Income (UBTI)**

It was noted earlier that the investment earnings inside a qualified retirement plan are not currently taxable. This is also true for IRAs. An exception to this important general tax advantage is that if the IRA (both traditional and Roth IRAs) or the qualified plan has investments that produce *unrelated business taxable income (UBTI)*, the UBTI will be taxable income.

UBTI can result from net earnings from the conduct of an unrelated trade or business regularly carried on by the exempt trust or organization and from income from debt-financed property. Thus, if an IRA or qualified plan carries on an unrelated trade or business, receives certain passive income from a business entity it controls, or invests in a pass-through entity (such as a partnership or LLC) that conducts such a trade or business (including limited partnership interests, as described in Chapter 6), it will produce UBTI. Similarly, if a plan borrows money to acquire property to produce income, it will be debt-financed property and the income from such property will be UBTI. Some examples of such debt-financed property are margin accounts (as described in Chapter 5), real estate mortgages only for IRAs, and life insurance policy loans used to finance other property in the case of qualified plans (IRAs cannot invest in life insurance policies). UBTI under \$1,000 is tax deductible.

Naturally, UBTI should be avoided when structuring the investments of qualified plans and IRAs. UBTI essentially results in income being taxed twice—once to the plan and again to plan participants or beneficiaries when it is paid out to them as distributions (except for distributions from Roth IRAs).

It should also be noted that the UBTI concept applies not only to qualified plans and IRAs, but to other kinds of tax-exempt entities as well. Such other entities include charities and charitable remainder trusts (CRTs), discussed in Chapter 19.

### **Life Insurance Owned by the Plan**

Some qualified retirement plans may be funded, at least in part, with life insurance contracts (called individual policy plans), and others may purchase life insurance policies (or health insurance) on the lives of participants as an investment of the plan. (IRAs may not purchase life insurance as a plan asset.) The IRS *in Treasury* regulations has provided that such life and health insurance benefits must be incidental to the primary purpose of the plans. The primary purpose of a pension plan is to provide retirement income; the primary purpose of a profit-sharing plan is to provide deferred compensation.

The main way the IRS determines whether life and health insurance are "incidental" is by requiring that the cost of providing current insurance protection (i.e., the term cost for life insurance) be less than 25 percent of the cost of providing all benefits under the plan. This basic requirement is applied in different ways, depending on the type of plan involved and the insurance contracts used. For profit-sharing plans where ordinary life insurance (whole life) policies are purchased on participants' lives, the annual policy premiums must be less than 50 percent of the annual amount allocated to each participant's account (on the theory that about one-half of ordinary life premiums during an employee's working years go for the cost of current life insurance protection, i.e., the term cost). Profit-sharing plans purchasing term insurance and some other types of insurance must meet the 25 percent test. For pension plans, the incidental death benefit requirement is satisfied if the death benefit does not exceed that which would be paid if all benefits under the plan were funded by retirement income type life insurance policies, which provide a death benefit of \$1,000 (or the policy reserve, if greater) for each \$10 of monthly lifetime retirement income guaranteed by the policy at a designated retirement age (referred to as the 100-to-1 rule), or the death benefit satisfies the less-than-50-percent test for ordinary life policies described earlier.

In connection with the 100-to-1 rule, defined-benefit pension plans that are entirely funded with life insurance or annuity contracts are referred to as *412(i) plans*. They are named after the IRC provision that exempts such plans meeting certain requirements from the minimum funding requirements otherwise applying to defined-benefit plans.

The use of life insurance in qualified plans and some planning issues concerning such life insurance are covered further in Chapter 21.

# **Nonqualified Retirement Plans**

These are plans that do not meet the requirements for qualification set by the tax law. Nonqualified plans, for example, can be structured to favor highly compensated employees (i.e., to be discriminatory). The compensation cap and other limits on contributions or benefits for qualified plans have increasingly caused employers to adopt nonqualified plans for their higher-paid employees. These plans are described in Chapter 14.

# **Pension Plans Basic Characteristics**

A pension plan is a qualified retirement plan maintained by an employer primarily to provide *definitely determinable benefits* to employees or their beneficiaries at and after retirement. A plan may provide definitely determinable benefits either by providing fixed benefits at retirement (a defined-benefit plan) or by having fixed employer contributions (a money-purchase plan) that normally are a set percentage of employees' compensation.

Pension plans cannot permit the withdrawal of employer contributions or the investment earnings thereon before the employee's retirement, death, disability, severance of employment, or termination of the plan. Contributions to fund a pension plan are not discretionary for an employer. The employer must make annual contributions necessary to fund the benefits provided by the plan.

# **When Are Retirement Benefits Payable?**

**Normal Retirement Age** The normal retirement age in a DB plan is the earliest age at which participants can retire with full benefits. For example, the normal retirement age may be 65, usually assuming some minimum period of service. An employee usually is not required to retire at this age; it is simply the age at which full pension benefits are payable.

**Early Retirement Provisions** Many DB plans provide reduced benefits when employees retire at specified ages that are earlier than normal retirement age, often subject to certain conditions. Sometimes, when employers want to encourage early retirement by offering employees a temporary early retirement plan (a so-called early retirement window), a part of the program will be to eliminate or reduce any regular early retirement reduction factors. This is one of the factors to consider when deciding whether to accept such an early retirement option.

In the case of DC plans, the benefit available at early retirement is the account balance accumulated when the employee actually retires. There is no formal early retirement reduction factor, but, of course, no further contributions would be made to the employee's account after retirement.

**Deferred Retirement** Employers no longer can require employees to retire at any mandatory age, except for certain executive employees. Thus, most employees can continue working past normal retirement age if they wish and are able to do so. In this case, qualified DB plans must continue to accrue their benefits and DC plans must make contributions and allocations on their behalf for work past normal retirement age.

# **Kinds of Pension Plan Benefits**

**Retirement Benefits** Pension plans traditionally have been designed to provide a life annuity (life income) for the covered employee or the covered employee and a joint annuitant. For married employees, the retirement benefit (annuity form) must be payable in accordance with the REA requirements described earlier.

Benefits may be payable in forms other than a life income. An increasing number of plans give employees the option of having their benefits actuarially converted (commuted) into a lump-sum payment at retirement. Whether this is desirable from the participant's (and perhaps his or her spouse's) viewpoint depends on the circumstances and how liberal the lump-sum payment is. However, it may be noted that in many cases, a lifetime income that the participant (or the participant and his or her spouse) cannot outlive provides a sound basis (with Social Security) upon which to plan a financially secure retirement. This issue is discussed further in Chapter 16. The ability to choose forms of retirement benefits is, of course, subject to the REA rules.

**Benefits upon Termination of Employment** These depend on the plan's vesting provisions and were discussed earlier.

**Death Benefits** Pension plans can provide death benefits in several ways. One is when an employee receives retirement income in the form of a *joint and survivor life annuity* or a *refund life annuity.* For example, if a married retiring employee provides for a joint life and full benefit to the survivor form of annuity for the employee and his or her spouse, the pension plan, in effect, is providing death protection equal to the full periodic pension benefit for the spouse in the event the employee dies first.5

Pension plans also may include *preretirement death benefits.* Such benefits may be from life insurance proceeds, in the case of plans funded with life insurance policies, but they mainly come from the QPSA required by REA.

**Disability Income Benefits** In some plans, a form of disability protection is afforded by allowing disabled workers to retire early. Other pension plans provide for a separate disability income benefit unrelated to retirement benefits.

**Medical Expense Benefits** Sometimes assets accumulated in pension plans may be used to provide medical benefits for retired employees, their spouses, and their dependents.

5Note that REA requires at least a joint life and 50 percent to the survivor annuity form (a QJSA). However, the parties can choose a more liberal survivor benefit (up to 100 percent), as shown in this example.

### **Pension Plan Benefit Formulas**

**Defined-Benefit Formulas** A *flat-amount formula* sometimes is used. In this case, all participants upon retirement are given the same benefit. A formula that relates benefits to earnings is the *flat-percentage formula.* Under this formula, a pension equal to a given percentage of an employee's average annual compensation is paid at retirement to all employees completing a minimum number of years of credited service. Employees who fail to meet the minimum service requirement may be given a proportionately reduced pension. The average compensation to which the percentage applies may be the employees' average earnings over the full period of their participation in the plan (a career average approach) or the average of their earnings over the final few years of their participation (a final average approach).

A formula that relates benefits to years of service but not to earnings is the *flat-amount-unit-benefit formula.* Here, an employee is given a flat amount of benefit per month for each year of credited service.

A widely used formula is the *percentage-unit-benefit formula.* An employee may be given, say, a life annuity of 1.5 percent of earnings for each year of credited service starting at a given age (normal retirement age). Again, the earnings to which the percentage is applied may be the earnings during each year (career average) or the average annual earnings during, say, the last 5 or 10 years before retirement (final average).

### **Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)**

A part of ERISA was establishment of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). This corporation sets up an insurance program for employees and pensioners of companies that have gone out of business, have become insolvent, or can no longer maintain their plan. The PBGC insures vested benefits of defined-benefit pension plans up to a certain amount. In 2009, this maximum amount was \$4,500 per month for persons retiring at age 65, with a straight life annuity form. This maximum is adjusted for other eligible retirees.

This program provides an additional element of safety for covered active plan participants, former employees, and retirees. However, there is no comparable insolvency protection for pension benefits in excess of the maximum amount insured by the PBGC.

The PBGC is financed by premiums paid per covered employee by employers who maintain defined-benefit qualified plans. It is expected by many that if the PBGC's losses (say during difficult economic times) should exceed its resources, the government would provide additional financing. This is not guaranteed, however.

# **Profit-Sharing Plans Basic Characteristics**

Unlike pension plans, profit-sharing plans usually base their contributions for employees on the employer's profits and hence do not provide definitely determinable benefits. However, the existence of current or accumulated profits is not required for contributions to these plans.

Profit-sharing plans are DC plans under which contributions are allocated to individual accounts for participants. These individual accounts are credited with investment earnings and may be credited with nonvested forfeitures from other accounts that may be reallocated due to employee turnover.

Annual contributions usually are discretionary with the employer (a discretionary contribution formula); however, once made, they must be allocated among participants according to a definite, predetermined formula (a fixed allocation formula).

Distributions from profit-sharing plans are legally permitted after a certain number of years; after reaching a certain age; after retirement; after other termination of employment; or upon the occurrence of some event such as death, illness, disability, or layoff. The terms of a particular plan, however, may limit such withdrawals.

### **Regular Profit-Sharing Plans**

Many profit-sharing plans base their allocation formula only on participant compensation. This results in a uniform proportionate contribution for each covered employee, regardless of age. This approach tends to favor younger employees.

# **Age-Weighted Profit-Sharing Plans**

These are more complicated plans and may be based on the concept of cross-testing for nondiscrimination purposes.6 Cross-testing is allowed under IRS regulations and essentially involves testing defined-contribution plans for nondiscrimination based on projected benefits (like a definedbenefit plan) and testing defined-benefit plans for nondiscrimination based on contributions. However, cross-testing normally is applied to definedcontribution plans.

<sup>6</sup>There can also be age-weighted money-purchase pension plans, but age-weighted plans generally are structured as profit-sharing plans. Also, age-weighted plans may not be based on cross-testing under an IRS "safe harbor" formula.

#### **Retirement Needs Analysis, Social Security, and Retirement Plans 341**

An age-weighted profit-sharing plan is one that bases its allocation formula on both the age and the compensation of participants.7 These plans tend to favor older employees with higher earnings (who are often the owner–employees of closely held businesses). However, total profit-sharing contributions in any year cannot exceed 25 percent of overall covered compensation, and allocations to any participant cannot exceed the Section 415 limits described earlier. As with profit-sharing plans generally, contributions usually are discretionary with the employer.

### **New Comparability Profit-Sharing Plans**

These also are cross-tested plans. They are DC plans, but they are tested for nondiscrimination purposes like a DB plan. Current profit-sharing allocations can vary not only by each participant's covered compensation and age, but also by his or her job classification. The annual limits on taxdeductible employer contributions are the same as for age-weighted plans. Contributions can also be discretionary with the employer.

The effect of new comparability plans is that there can be considerable disparity between the proportionate allocations for older, more highly compensated employees than for younger, lower-compensated employees. However, the IRS now has minimum allocation standards for cross-tested plans.

# **Savings (Thrift) Plans General Characteristics**

Savings plans are qualified DC plans that have become popular over the years as a way for employees to accumulate capital in a tax-advantageous way. These plans permit employees to make voluntary contributions of a percentage of their compensation, and then may provide for the employer to contribute a specified percentage of the employee's contribution (called a *matching contribution*), up to a certain limit. Employees also may have the option of making additional unmatched contributions.

As an example, a savings plan might permit employees to contribute from 1 to 6 percent of their compensation each year and then provide that the employer will contribute at the end of the year an amount equal to 50 percent of the employee's contribution. In addition, employees might be permitted to contribute up to an additional 10 percent of their pay, which

<sup>7</sup> IRS regulations permit allocations under cross-tested profit-sharing plans to be weighted for age or service as well as compensation. This discussion assumes weighting by age and compensation.

would not be matched by the employer. Technically, savings plans are a form of profit-sharing plan. Larger employers often have a pension plan and a separate savings plan (usually with a Section 401(k) option), but some have only a savings plan with a Section 401(k) option.

# **Participant-Directed Accounts**

Contributions on behalf of participants and the investment earnings thereon go into individual accounts for each participant. As noted earlier under "Investment Considerations for Retirement Plans," it has become increasingly common for savings plans (and perhaps other kinds of plans) to permit participants to decide how their account balances will be invested within the investment funds provided by the employer under the plan.

The number and kinds of separate funds vary among plans, but, as noted previously, they must include a reasonable breadth of investment products for different investment objectives. Employees may be given investment choices for all contributions, but often will initially will have choices only with respect to their own contributions. Employers may direct that their own matching contributions go into an employer stock fund.

# **Before-Tax and After-Tax Contributions**

Employee contributions may be made from their pay after the withholding of income taxes (after-tax contributions) or through salary reduction arrangements before income taxes are withheld (before-tax contributions). When employee contributions are made on a before-tax basis, the plans are referred to as *cash or deferred arrangements* (CODAs) or more commonly as Section 401(k) plans (named after the section of the IRC that deals with cash or deferred arrangements). Today, most employee contributions are on a before-tax basis. Thus, to many people, the terms *savings plans* and *Section 401*(*k*) *plans* are almost synonymous.

# **Cash or Deferred Arrangements [Section 401(k) Plans]**

### **General Characteristics**

Section 401(k) permits covered employees to authorize their employer to reduce their salary and contribute the salary reduction to a qualified savings plan, profit-sharing plan, stock bonus plan, or money-purchase pension plan. No income tax is paid currently on the salary reduction. The amounts participants elect to defer are called the employee's elective contributions, elective deferrals, or before-tax elective contributions, and special restrictions apply to them.

# **Limits on Contributions to 401(k) Plans**

There are at least four separate limits on employee and employer contributions to qualified plans with a Section 401(k) option, as follows:

N There is an annual dollar cap on before-tax elective contributions from an employee to all CODAs covering the employee. This annual cap (base amount) is \$16,500 for 2009 (with indexing for inflation in \$500 increments).

In addition to the annual cap just noted, participants age 50 and older can make additional annual catch-up contributions of \$5,500 for 2009 (with indexing for inflation in \$500 increments). Thus, in 2009, a participant age 50 or older could have elective contributions of \$22,000 (\$16,500 base amount plus \$5,500 catch-up contribution).

- N There is an actual deferral percentage (ADP) nondiscrimination test for elective contributions, which, depending on the relative average contributions of highly compensated employees (HCEs) compared to those of non–highly compensated employees, may result in a limit for HCEs for a given year that is lower than the annual dollar cap just noted. However, for plans where the employer makes certain minimum contributions for non–highly compensated employees and provides full and immediate vesting for these contributions [referred to as "traditional" safe-harbor 401(k) plans], the ADP and actual contribution percentage (ACP) nondiscrimination tests are not applied, and the annual dollar cap (plus any catch-up contribution) would be the limit for HCEs.
- N There also is an actual contribution percentage (ACP nondiscrimination test for combined after-tax employee contributions and employer-matching contributions.
- N The regular Section 415 limits also apply to these plans.

### **Restrictions on Distributions from 401(k) Plans**

There are special restrictions on distributions from plans with 401(k) options. In general, amounts attributable to before-tax elective contributions may not be distributed to a participant or his or her beneficiary(ies) earlier than either attainment of age 59½, separation from employment, death, or disability, or in the event of hardship for the employee (as defined in IRS regulations).

### **Roth 401(k) Accounts (DRACs)**

Since 2006, participants in 401(k) plans [and Section 403(b) plans] have been allowed to elect to have all or part of their employee elective contributions (salary reductions) contributed to a *designated Roth account (DRAC)* within the plan, provided the plan so permits. These are also called *Roth 401(k) accounts*. The maximum that can be contributed to a DRAC each year is the annual dollar cap on employee elective contributions, plus any allowed make-up contribution, noted previously. Amounts so contributed are not tax-deferred like regular 401(k) employee elective contributions, but are taxed currently as gross income to the employees. However, DRACs, like Roth IRAs, which are described in Chapter 15, have tax-free growth of investment earnings in the account and tax-free distributions of account balances to participants and their beneficiaries. There also are no income or age limits on who can contribute to a DRAC.

Thus, participants can choose to place all their 401(k) elective contributions in a regular 401(k) salary reduction account (with no tax at contribution, but taxed as ordinary income at distribution); or, if the plan permits, place all their elective contributions in a DRAC (with tax initially on the contributed amount but no tax on a "qualified distribution"); or place part of their elective contributions in each. A DRAC can be an attractive option for higher-income employees who otherwise would not be eligible for a regular Roth IRA.

The provision for DRACs and certain other pension and retirement plan benefit provisions were part of EGTRRA of 2001, whose provisions were scheduled to "sunset" in 2011. However, PPA of 2006 made DRACs and the other pension and retirement provisions of EGTRRA permanent, and so they will not sunset.

### **Automatic Enrollment in 401(k) Plans**

PPA of 2006 provides another safe harbor from the nondiscrimination rules for 401(k) plans. If a 401(k) plan contains an "automatic contribution arrangement" (also called an automatic enrollment arrangement) that meets certain requirements, it is treated as meeting the nondiscrimination rules for deferrals and for matching employer contributions (the ADP and ACP tests) and also is not subject to the top-heavy rules.

Under this automatic arrangement, employees who are eligible to participate are assumed to have elected to have the employer make specific elective (salary reduction) contributions to the plan on their behalf, unless they affirmatively elect not to have such contributions made or to be made at a different level. This arrangement (including the additional safe harbor) is expected to encourage increased participation by employees in plans containing such an automatic contribution arrangement.

# **Advantages of 401(k) Plans**

**Tax Advantages** Employee contributions are made on a before-tax basis, and savings plans afford the other tax advantages of qualified plans described earlier.

**Systematic Savings and Investment** Another appeal of savings plans is the opportunity they afford employees for systematic investment through payroll deductions on a comparatively low-cost basis.

**Employer-Matching Contributions** For savings plans with matching employer contributions, participants' accounts are credited with the matching contributions as well as the employees' own contributions and the investment earnings on both.

**Employee Investment Choice** Participants normally are given a choice among a prescribed number of investment options for their contributions and possibly their employers' matching contributions. Thus, employees can integrate the investment of their plan accounts with their general asset allocation strategy.

**Tax-Efficient Changes in Asset Allocation Strategy** Account balances present participants with an inherent tax advantage, in that asset allocation changes among available investment options within the plan can be made without there being a sale or exchange for capital gains tax purposes.

# **Limitations on 401(k) Plans**

The advantages of Section 401(k) plans are impressive indeed. However, as with any planning tool, these plans also have some drawbacks.

**Limits on Contributions** As just explained, there are special limitations on contributions to Section 401(k) arrangements in addition to the regular limits on qualified plans in general.

**Restrictions on Distributions** There also are limits on distributions, as just described. However, these may not be that onerous because plan loans and hardship distributions usually are available.

**Participants Must Be Able to Afford Their Contributions** Savings plans with Section 401(k) options normally condition employer-matching contributions on initial employee contributions. This means participants must take a reduction in current wages or salary. Some cannot or will not do this.

#### **Distributions Are Ordinary Income and Income in Respect of a Decedent**

**(IRD)** In many cases, participants will have no income tax basis in qualified retirement plans with Section 401(k) options.8 This is because all funds have gone into the plan without any income taxes being paid on them. Therefore, when distributions come out of the plan (as they eventually must), they generally will be taxable as ordinary income, either when the participant receives them or as IRD after the participant's death.9 This tax treatment is, of course, true for qualified retirement plans in general. Nevertheless, despite this significant taxation at distribution, the tax-deferred results of these plans normally far outweigh the results of after-tax investing in currently taxable assets. This *power of deferral* is shown in the illustrations presented next.

In general, tax-deferral strategies are an effective approach to building wealth. A number of such strategies are discussed in this book. For the remainder of this chapter, however, we shall discuss deferral through traditional 401(k) plans.

# **Illustration of Before-Tax Contributions (Investing) Compared with After-Tax Investing (or the Power of Deferral)**

### **Assuming a Traditional Section 401(k) Plan with Employer Match**

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

To illustrate the principles just discussed, assume an employee, Lynn Rose, age 35, earns \$200,000 per year and can participate in a qualified savings plan with a Section 401(k) option or can make similar investments (after-tax) in directly owned assets. The plan allows her to elect to have up to 6 percent of her salary contributed to the savings plan before tax, and then her employer will match her elective contribution 50 cents on the dollar. Assuming Lynn elects the full 6 percent salary reduction (and ignoring for the sake of simplicity the likelihood that the plan will permit her to make additional elective contributions beyond what the

<sup>8</sup> See Chapter 16 for an explanation of how participants can acquire an income tax basis in their qualified retirement plans.

<sup>9</sup>Exceptions to this statement are when there is net unrealized appreciation (NUA) on employer securities in the plan and a lump-sum distribution is taken (as described in Chapter 16) and for the income tax deduction for estate taxes paid on IRD items (as described in Chapter 10).

employer will match), her salary and contribution picture would be as follows:

| Salary:                                                       | \$200,000 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Elective employee contribution (6%)                           | –12,000   |
| Taxable salary                                                | \$188,000 |
| Contributions going into the 401(k)<br>plan for the Employee: |           |
| Elective employee contribution                                | \$ 12,000 |
| Employer matching contribution (0.50 × \$12,000)              | 6,000     |
| Total annual contributions available                          |           |
| for investment in the plan (before-tax)                       | \$ 18,000 |

Assume instead that Lynn decides not to participate in the plan and that she wants to invest the 6 percent of salary, after tax, outside the plan in directly owned assets, and that she is in the 33 percent top marginal federal income tax bracket.10 Under these assumptions, her salary and investment picture would be:

| Salary                                     | \$200,000   |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Taxable salary                             | 200,000     |
| Comparable amount available for investment |             |
| (after-tax) in directly owned assets       |             |
| (\$12,000 × 0.67 = \$8,040)                | \$<br>8,040 |

Further assume that Lynn can earn 6 percent (all taxable as ordinary income) on her directly owned assets and 6 percent in her 401(k) plan account. Thus, her after-tax rate of return on the directly owned assets would be 4.02 percent (6% × 0.67 = 4.02%). Now, just for the sake of this illustration, let us say Lynn takes the entire balance in her 401(k) account at age 65 (or in 30 years).11 Thus, at age 65 (30 years later), the after-tax situation under both approaches would be as follows:12

| Direct investment:            |           |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| \$8,040 at 4.02% for 30 years | \$452,433 |

<sup>10</sup> State and local income taxes are ignored in this illustration for the sake of convenience. Also, some states tax salary reduction amounts under 401(k) and other plans.

<sup>11</sup>As we shall see in Chapter 16, she normally would not do this. Rather, she would continue to defer for a much longer time. Thus, deferral in practice would be more favorable than shown here.

<sup>12</sup>This assumes, just for illustrative purposes, that Lynn's salary remains at \$200,000 for this period and that her top marginal federal income tax rate remains at 33 percent.

# **Bases for Superior Results**

These rather spectacular results come from the following three factors:13

- N Tax-deferred compounding on a larger periodic payment—\$12,000 before tax versus \$8,040 after tax. (This represents deferral of the tax on the initial investments.)
- N Tax-deferred compounding on the full yield, i.e., 6 percent before tax compounded versus 4.02 percent after tax. (This represents deferral of the tax on the investment return.)
- N The employer match.

The first two factors represent the pure power of tax deferral on the employee's money. The third is extra employer money with tax deferral.

# **Modifying the Assumptions**

However, it may be argued that an employer's matching contribution is extra and really does not represent the power of deferral. It also may be argued that most investors will not invest a directly owned portfolio entirely in assets producing currently taxed ordinary income. They will include common stock (or other hopefully appreciating assets) in their asset allocations. Therefore, let us change our assumptions as follows:

- N There is no employer match.
- N The employee invests 50 percent of her directly owned portfolio in common stocks (with a 10 percent total return—6 percent capital gains and 4 percent qualified dividend income) and 50 percent in currently taxable assets (such as taxable bonds or CDs) earning 6 percent.
- N The tax rate is 15 percent on realized capital gains (with gains realized each year), 15 percent on qualified dividends, and 33 percent on ordinary income.

<sup>13</sup> Identifying these factors is important because while they all may apply to 401(k) arrangements, only some of them apply to other tax-deferred arrangements. Therefore, other arrangements will not be as attractive as the typical qualified savings plan with a Section 401(k) option.

- N One half of the capital gains on the directly owned portfolio is never taxed because there is a step-up in basis at death or for other reasons.
- N The Section 401(k) account has the same asset allocation and average return, 8 percent, as the directly owned portfolio.

Given these new assumptions, which are generous in favor of the after-tax directly owned portfolio, the before-tax 401(k) approach still produces markedly better results, as the following calculation shown.

| Direct investment:                    |               |  |
|---------------------------------------|---------------|--|
| \$8,040 at 6.49%* for 30 years        | \$<br>693,219 |  |
| Savings plan (with no employer match) |               |  |
| with Section 401(k) option:           |               |  |
| \$12,000 at 8% for 30 years           | \$1,359,399   |  |
| Minus Lynn's basis in the plan        | 0             |  |
| Amount taxable as ordinary income     | \$1,359,399   |  |
| Minus income tax payable (at 33%)     | 448,602       |  |
| After-tax balance                     | \$<br>910,797 |  |
|                                       |               |  |

\*This is the after-tax total yield on the directly owned portfolio under the assumptions just given.

Thus, assuming a reasonably long period of deferral and consistent assumptions, the power of tax deferral alone in this example produces an after-tax retirement fund about 32 percent greater for the participants in the 401(k) plan despite the relatively heavy taxation on distributions.

### **Appropriate Assets for Tax-Advantaged versus Taxable Accounts**

The extent of the power of tax deferral [e.g., in tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k) plans] as compared with the investment results in taxable accounts depends on several factors. They include:

- N *The length of the period of deferral.* The longer this period, the greater the power of deferral for tax-advantaged accounts. For relatively short periods, there may be no advantage, or taxable accounts may be favored, depending on the circumstances.
- N *Tax rates.* The higher the marginal tax rate, the greater the advantage of tax deferral.
- N *Investment returns.* The greater the investment returns assumed, the more effective tax deferral will be.
- N *The nature of the asset classes in each kind of account.* This factor was illustrated in the modified assumptions for the case example just cited.

In actual asset allocation planning, however, it often is desirable to hold different asset classes in tax-advantaged accounts than in taxable accounts. This is referred to as *location analysis* and was discussed in Chapter 9.

# **Stock Bonus Plans and Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)**

### **Stock Bonus Plans**

These are qualified retirement plans that are similar to profit-sharing plans, except that employer contributions do not necessarily depend on profit, and benefits may be distributable in the form of the employer's stock. Employers may make contributions to stock bonus plans in cash or in their own stock. Their annual contributions are limited to 25 percent of payroll.

# **Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)**

**General Characteristics** An ESOP is a qualified retirement plan that is structured either as a stock bonus plan or as a combination of a stock bonus plan and a money-purchase pension plan. An ESOP differs from traditional stock bonus plans in that the ESOP is designed to invest primarily in employer stock. A traditional stock bonus plan may invest in employer stock, but it is not required to do so other than to make distributions in employer stock to participants. Perhaps the most important difference, however, is that an employer establishing an ESOP may guarantee or make loans to the ESOP to enable the ESOP to acquire employer stock, whereas traditional stock bonus plans generally may not do this, since it would be a prohibited transaction under ERISA. ESOPs involving such debt are called *leveraged ESOPs.*

Several special provisions apply to ESOPs. For example, when a participant is entitled to a distribution, the plan normally is required to make the distribution in employer stock, although the distribution can be in cash if the participant is entitled to elect that it be in employer stock. However, if a participant receives a distribution of employer stock that is not readily tradable on an established market, the participant must have the right to sell the stock back to the employer for its fair market value. The law also has a provision with regard to the timing of distributions, unless a participant elects otherwise. In addition, there are special diversification elections for participants who have attained age 55 and have 10 or more years of participation.

**Sale of Appreciated Stock to an ESOP** In certain circumstances, an ESOP can provide a market for closely held stock through the purchase of such stock from a stockholder while he or she is alive, or from the stockholder's estate at the time of death. This technique is illustrated in Chapter 11.

# **Hybrid Qualified Retirement Plans**

These are qualified plans that exhibit some characteristics of DB plans and some characteristics of DC plans.

# **Cash Balance Plans**

These technically are DB plans, but are structured to look like DC plans. The employer typically contributes a percentage of each employee's compensation, which is actuarially determined so that there will be funds in the plan to pay the defined benefits. The contributions are pooled for all participants so there are no real individual accounts for each participant as there would be in a DC plan. However, a hypothetical account is maintained for each participant to which a fixed percentage of the participant's compensation (such as 4 or 5 percent) and an interest rate specified in the plan are credited each year. But this interest rate is not the rate of return actually earned on plan assets.

The retirement benefit is the annuity income that the hypothetical account balance would purchase using mortality and interest assumptions provided by the plan. Since these are DB plans, they are subject to ERISA's minimum funding requirements and to PBGC rules and premiums.

Cash balance plans have been adopted by some larger employers and often result from conversions of traditional DB plans. They generally result in relatively greater benefits for younger and shorter-service employees, relatively lower benefits for older and longer-service employees, and lower overall costs for the employer than traditional DB plans. Benefits generally may be paid to participants as a lump sum or in periodic payments.

# **Pension Equity Plans**

Another type of hybrid DB plan is the pension equity plan. For that plan, benefits are normally expressed as a percentage of final average pay, with the percentage based on points received for each year of service. The points may be greater for older or longer service participants.

In the past, cash balance and pension equity plans have faced age discrimination challenges by participants in the courts. However, PPA of 2006 provides that these plans do not violate the age discrimination or minimum present value rules provided they meet certain requirements.

# **Target Benefit Plans**

Target benefit plans technically are DC plans. However, an employer's annual contributions to the plan are based on a target benefit formula, with given actuarial assumptions, that is the same kind of formula that would be used in a DB plan. However, employer contributions are allocated to actual individual accounts for participants whose retirement benefits will be based on the balances actually accumulated in each participant's account at retirement.

# **Floor Offset Plans**

This is another hybrid arrangement that involves an employer having both a DB plan and a DC plan. In essence, participants receive the larger of the retirement benefits produced by each of these plans, but not the benefits from both. In practice, the benefits produced by the DB plan are reduced by a participant's account balance in the DC plan.

# **Retirement Plans for the Self-Employed (HR-10 or Keogh Plans) General Considerations**

Before 1963, sole proprietors and partners could have qualified retirement plans covering their employees, but they, as owners of their businesses (i.e., principals), could not get the tax advantages of these plans because technically they were not employees even though they were actively engaged in the operation of the business. However, the Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962 (also called HR-10 or the Keogh Act), with its subsequent amendments, has made it possible for owners of unincorporated businesses and other self-employed persons to be covered under qualified retirement plans. An HR-10 plan, therefore, is a formal arrangement whereby selfemployed persons may establish a program to provide tax-favored retirement benefits for themselves and their eligible employees.

The tax law allows self-employed persons to be considered employees for purposes of establishing and contributing to qualified retirement plans in any year in which they have earned income. *Earned income* for this purpose means a person's net earnings from self-employment in a trade or business (including a profession) in which the person's personal services are a material income-producing factor. (Note that capital may also be a material income-producing factor and the net earnings still will qualify for HR-10 purposes.) Net earnings from self-employment generally are determined by deducting business expenses (including contributions to the HR-10 plan and contributions to other tax-deductible employee benefit plans for the regular [nonowner] employees of the firm)14 from the net revenues of the business. In essence, they are the net profits of the business.

Earned income is the basis for determining contributions to an HR-10 plan on behalf of self-employed persons. However, in calculating earned income, one-half of the person's self-employment tax (social security tax) and the contributions made to the HR-10 plan on his or her behalf must be deducted from otherwise determined net earnings to arrive at earned income.15

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

As an illustration, suppose that Homer Stone, age 45, is a sole proprietor who employs two common-law employees in his business. Homer is self-employed and materially participates in managing the business. The business's annual gross income is \$600,000 and it has business expenses (aside from any contributions to a qualified retirement plan) of \$451,000. Assume Homer decides to adopt a qualified discretionary profit-sharing (HR-10) plan covering himself and his two employees. Homer further decides this year to contribute 15 percent of covered compensation to this plan. One of Homer's employees is paid \$35,000 per year and the other is paid \$25,000 per year. The situation with respect to this HR-10 plan at the end of a year would be as follows:

| Gross income of business                     | \$600,000  |
|----------------------------------------------|------------|
| Business expenses (other than retirement     |            |
| plan contributions)                          | –451,000   |
| Retirement plan contributions for common-law |            |
| employees (\$60,000 × 0.15)                  | –<br>9,000 |
| Net profit of business                       | \$140,000  |

The amount that Homer can contribute to the HR-10 plan for himself would be determined as follows:

| 1<br>Profit<br>of<br>self-employment<br>(Social<br>Security)<br>t<br>ax<br>2<br>= | earned<br>income |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| 1<br>+<br>plan<br>contribution<br>percentage<br>as<br>a<br>decimal                |                  |

14These regular employees are referred to as the *common-law employees* of the business. They are not the owners of the business and are in the same position as any employees of an employer with regard to employee benefits and other employment matters. A self-employed person may or may not have common-law employees.

15This involves a rather complicated and circular calculation, as shown in the following example. It results in maximum limits on tax-deductible contributions to HR-10 plans on behalf of self-employed persons that, in effect, are lower than the 25 percent of compensation for profit-sharing, stock bonus, and money-purchase pension plans.

Which in this example would be:

 $$140,000 - $8,496 = $114,351$  (Homer's earned income for the year)  $1+0.15$ (or 1.15)

Then, the *contribution amount* to the plan for the year for Homer would be:

 $114,351 \times 0.15 (15\%) = 17,153$ 

While this contribution amount is 15 percent of Homer's earned income as just calculated, it equals only 12.25 percent of his net earnings from self-employment ( $$17,153 \div $140,000 =$  $0.1225$  or  $12.25$  percent).

### **Deductible Contributions**

The contributions to an HR-10 plan on behalf of self-employed persons are deductible by the self-employed persons on their own individual tax returns from their gross income to arrive at their adjusted gross income.<sup>16</sup> The contributions are not deductible by the business itself in determining its net profit. Thus, in the illustration just given, Homer would report \$140,000 net profit from his business as part of his gross income, but then he would deduct the \$17,153 contribution to the HR-10 plan from his gross income to arrive at his adjusted gross income. This would result in a net amount of business income subject to income tax of \$122,847 (\$140,000 - \$17,153).

While not involving HR-10 plans, it may also be noted that self-employed persons may deduct 100 percent of the health insurance premiums paid for themselves, their spouses, and their dependents from their gross income to arrive at their adjusted gross income. This applies the same principle to health insurance premiums that HR-10 applies to retirement benefits. However, the costs of other kinds of employee benefits (such as group term life insurance and disability income insurance) on behalf of self-employed persons (and more than 5 percent owners of S corporations) are not deductible by either the business or the self-employed person. This is a disadvantage of selfemployed and S corporation ownership status.

### Who May Establish HR-10 Plans?

Sole proprietors with earned income can establish their own HR-10 plans. They may have common-law employees covered by the plan as well.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>16</sup>Thus, they are deductible whether or not the taxpayer itemizes his or her deductions. In tax terms, they are deductible *above the line*.

On the other hand, they may not have any employees and be the only covered person.

A self-employed person may have an HR-10 plan with respect to his or her earned income from self-employment, and at the same time, he or she may be a common-law employee for another employer and also be covered under that employer's qualified retirement plan or plans.

A partnership can establish an HR-10 plan for its partners as well as for any covered common-law employees. However, in order for a partner to participate in a firm's plan, he or she must have earned income from the partnership's trade or business in which his or her personal services were a material income-producing factor. Thus, a purely investment interest in a partnership (like most limited partners, for example), with respect to which no personal services are rendered, will not suffice for HR-10 participation.

A partner's earned income normally is his or her share of the partnership's net income, including any guaranteed payments to the partner. The members of an LLC normally are treated like partners for tax purposes, assuming they elect to be taxed like a partnership under the check-the-box regulations.

The stockholder–employees of corporations (either C corporations or S corporations) are not self-employed persons and are not eligible for HR-10 plans. They can be covered as regular employees under qualified retirement plans established by their corporation.

Finally, some self-employed persons are classified as owner–employees for HR-10 purposes. Owner–employees are persons who own 100 percent of an unincorporated trade or business (sole proprietors) or partners who own more than 10 percent of either a capital interest or a profit interest in a partnership.

### **Kinds of HR-10 Plans**

Self-employed persons can adopt a variety of HR-10 plans. For example, they may have a defined-benefit pension plan, a money purchase pension plan, a profit-sharing plan, or a 401(k) plan. Keogh plans may also be integrated with Social Security.

Self-employed persons also can adopt SEP plans and SIMPLE plans. However, they cannot have one of these plans and another type of retirement plan (such as an HR-10 plan). SEP and SIMPLE plans are covered in Chapter 14.

### **Parity with Corporate Retirement Plans**

Prior to 1982, HR-10 plans were subject to a number of special restrictions and limits that did not apply to qualified corporate retirement plans. However, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) eliminated almost all of these special requirements for HR-10 plans.

Therefore, HR-10 plans generally have the same eligibility and coverage requirements, contribution limits (except as just noted), vesting requirements, rules for integration with Social Security, and other plan requirements as for qualified retirement plans covering corporate employees.
