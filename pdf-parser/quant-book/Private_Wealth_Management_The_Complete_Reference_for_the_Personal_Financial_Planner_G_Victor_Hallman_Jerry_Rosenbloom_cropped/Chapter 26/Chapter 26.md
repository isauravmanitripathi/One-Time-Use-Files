This chapter gives an overview of the federal transfer tax system as it stands as of this writing—the federal gift tax, estate tax, and generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax. This system generally was designed so that wealth would be subject to a transfer tax in each generation. This includes lifetime transfers by gift, transfers at death, and transfers designed to skip generations. Thus, it has been referred to as a *unified transfer tax system.*

# **Impact of Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA)**

As noted in Chapter 2, the *Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act* (EGTRRA) of 2001 may dramatically change this system. The three transfer taxes will remain, with some changes, through 2009. Then, in 2010, the federal estate tax and GST tax will be repealed entirely for that year, but the gift tax will be retained. However, in 2011, the unified transfer tax system as it stood in 2001 will be reinstated for the future under the sunset provision. Most commentators think there will be new tax legislation before 2011 (probably in 2009) that will change this scenario, but no one can be sure at this time.

At the end of this chapter, there is a discussion on some likely changes in the system that probably will be made before 2011. They include: no repeal of the estate tax, retention of this present exclusion amount of \$3,500,000, retention of the present tax rate of 45 percent, and allowing the transfer (probability) of a deceased spouse's unused unified credit to a surviving spouse.

# **Applicable Credit Amount (Unified Credit) and Applicable Exclusion Amount**

The tax law provides for each person a one-time *applicable credit amount (unified credit)*<sup>1</sup> of \$1,455,800 in 2009. This credit can be applied to reduce or eliminate any federal estate tax payable at the person's death. The unified credit will allow a person to pass a substantial amount of wealth to others free of federal estate tax. This amount is called the *applicable exclusion amount.*

The operation of this system can be seen if we say, for example, that in the year 2009, a decedent has a taxable estate of \$3,500,000. Applying the unified transfer tax rate schedule (not shown here), we can calculate a tentative tax on this amount of \$1,455,800. An applicable credit amount of

<sup>1</sup>The terms *applicable credit amount* and *unified credit* mean the same thing. In practice, they tend to be used interchangeably and are so used in this book.

\$1,455,800 will exactly offset this tentative tax, so that is the applicable credit amount which produces an applicable exclusion amount of \$3,500,000. This excluded amount will return to \$1,000,000 in 2011 unless there is new tax legislation changing it. As we shall see in Chapter 28, a great deal of marital deduction planning is aimed at using effectively the applicable credit amounts of both spouses. The unified credit and applicable exclusion amounts are not indexed for inflation.

The unified credit-applicable exclusion amount system also applies to gift taxation. For 2009, the applicable exclusion amount for federal gift tax purposes is \$1,000,000 and remains so in subsequent years. The gift tax is not repealed in 2010. However, under EGTRRA's sunset provision, all transfer tax rules, including for gift taxes, return to their 2001 form. The gift tax excluded amount is not indexed for inflation.

# **Federal Gift Tax**

It comes as a surprise to many people that there is a federal gift tax. It applies to transferring ownership rights in property during a lifetime and is levied against the donor, who must file a gift tax return when required by law.

## **What Are Taxable Transfers for Gift Tax Purposes?**

The gift tax is on the transfer of property by any individual. Only individuals are subject to gift taxation. The term *gift* is not expressly defined in the IRC, but it is construed to mean the transfer of property for less than full and adequate consideration. To be a taxable gift, the transfer must be *complete.* This means the donor must have relinquished enough dominion and control over the property so that it no longer is subject to his or her will and the donor no longer can control its disposition. For example, if a donor alone deposits funds in a joint bank account or a joint brokerage account with his or her child, with either having the power unilaterally to withdraw the full amount, there has been no completed gift because the donor could simply withdraw the whole amount and recover the property. On the other hand, if the child in fact did withdraw his or her half (or more), there would be a completed gift of that amount at that time.

## **Methods of Making Gifts**

Some common methods are as follows:

N *Outright gifts*. Here, the donee has immediate possession, use, and enjoyment of the gift property.

#### **606 Part VIII. Estate Planning**

- N *Gifts to irrevocable inter vivos (living) trusts*. In this case, the donee(s) are the beneficiaries of the trust.
- N *Gifts to custodianship arrangements*. Here, the donee(s) are minor recipients of property held by a custodian under a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act. (These acts are discussed in Chapter 27.)
- N *Receiving property as joint owners with the donor.* In this situation, the donor places property or funds that he or she formerly owned outright in joint names with the donee.
- N *The exercise, release, or lapse during the lifetime of a general power of appointment in favor of someone other than the holder of the power.*<sup>2</sup> Here, the gift is from the possessor of the power to the other party or parties. However, the tax law provides that the lapse of a power during the possessor's lifetime will only be considered a release of that power (and hence a taxable transfer) to the extent that the property that could have been appointed exceeds the larger of \$5,000 or 5 percent of the aggregate value of the assets out of which the power could have been satisfied. This means, for example, that if a trust beneficiary is given a power of withdrawal (a general power) each year over trust assets that is limited to the greater of \$5,000 or 5 percent of the trust corpus, and the power for each year expires (lapses) at the end of that year, a lapse of this withdrawal right will not result in a taxable gift by its possessor (the trust beneficiary) to the other trust beneficiaries. This is referred to as a 5 *and* 5 *power.* It is an important concept in estate planning.
- N *Other gifts*.

### **Exclusions and Deductions**

The gifts most people make will not be subject to gift taxation. This is because of exclusions and deductions applying to the federal gift tax.

**Per-Donee Annual Exclusion** Every donor can make tax-free gifts each year up to \$13,000, in 2009 (indexed for inflation in increments of \$1,000), each to however many persons the donor wishes. Gifts within the annual exclusion do not reduce the donor's unified credit. Rather sizeable amounts

<sup>2</sup>As explained in Chapter 25, a general power of appointment exists when the holder of the power can exercise it in favor of himself or herself, his or her creditors, his or her estate, or the creditors of his or her estate. The aforementioned rule applies to general powers of appointment created after October 21, 1942. For general powers created on or before that date, the exercise of the power results in a transfer (gift) by the holder, but the failure to exercise (lapse) or release of such a power is not considered an exercise of the power and, hence, is not a taxable event. Thus, in the relatively few cases of these pre–October 21, 1942, general powers, the holder generally should not exercise the power and thus would avoid transfer taxation on property subject to the power.

often can be given away each year under the annual exclusion. To take a rather extreme example, in 2009, a donor might give \$13,000 in money or securities outright to each of, say, 12 persons (perhaps his or her children and grandchildren), or total gifts of \$156,000 in the year, without reducing his or her unified credit at all. For this reason, spacing out gifts to one or more donees over a period of years often can keep the amounts within the annual exclusion. It must be remembered, however, that the annual exclusion applies to all gifts made by a donor to a donee during a year. Therefore, if a donor already has made several smaller gifts to a donee in a year, the donor cannot make the full \$13,000 (indexed) gift to the same donee during the year and stay within the annual exclusion.

**Present Interest Requirement for Annual Exclusion** The annual exclusion applies only to gifts of a *present interest* in property (i.e., where the donee has the immediate possession, use, or enjoyment of the gift); it does not apply to gifts of future interests (i.e., where the donee's possession, use, or enjoyment is deferred). For example, an outright gift is a gift of a present interest of the full value of the property because the donee has the unrestricted immediate use, possession, and enjoyment of all the gift property by virtue of sole ownership. However, when gifts are made in trust, this issue becomes more complicated. It depends on the terms of the trust.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume, for example, an irrevocable trust provides that income must be paid annually to a beneficiary for a term of 15 years (mandatory right to income), and at the end of that time the corpus will be paid outright to the beneficiary or his or her issue (as remainderperson).3 Further assume that Amy (as grantor) transfers \$13,000 worth of common stock into this trust. The present value of the mandatory right to income from the gift property is a gift of a present interest to the beneficiary since he or she has the immediate possession, use, and enjoyment of the income stream for 15 years. This value qualifies for the per-donee annual exclusion. On the other hand, the present value of the remainder interest is a future interest (since its possession, use, and enjoyment is delayed for 15 years) and does not qualify for the annual exclusion. Assuming a 7.2 percent interest rate (the Section 7520 rate

<sup>3</sup>Assume for the sake of this illustration that this trust does not qualify for any special annual exclusion treatment. In other words, it is what may be referred to as a Section 2503(b) income interest trust. Other ways for qualifying periodic gifts for the annual exclusion (such as for minors) are discussed in Chapter 27.

explained in Chapter 3), the present value of an income interest for 15 years is 0.647566 (64.7566 percent) and the corresponding present value of a remainder interest at the end of 15 years is 0.352434 (35.2434 percent) of the amount transferred to the trust. Therefore, in this example, \$8,418 (\$13,000 × 0.647566) is a gift of a present interest and qualifies for the annual exclusion, while \$4,582 (\$10,000 × 0.352434) is a gift of a future interest, does not qualify for the annual exclusion, and would be a taxable gift this year for Amy.

However, if we change this example to say the trust provides that the trustee may accumulate income in the trust or pay it out to the beneficiary in the trustee's discretion during the 15-year term (a discretionary income provision), none of the transfer would be a gift of a present interest because the beneficiary does not have unrestricted immediate possession, use, or enjoyment of the income stream (it can be changed at the trustee's discretion) or of the principal (payment of the remainder interest is delayed 15 years). Therefore, Amy does not have any annual exclusion and the full \$13,000 transfer this year is a taxable gift by Amy to the trust beneficiary.4

**Unlimited Exclusion for Transfers for Educational and Medical Expenses** This important exclusion is in addition to the per-donee annual exclusion. It excludes from gift taxation any amount paid on behalf of an individual (no particular relationship to the donor is required) to an educational organization5 as tuition (books, room and board, etc., are not included) for the education or training of such individual. It also excludes any amount paid on behalf of an individual to any person or entity that provides medical care with respect to such individual. These can be valuable exclusions for planning purposes.

<sup>4</sup>As we shall see in the next chapter, an important way of making a transfer of property to a trust a gift of a present interest is to give the beneficiary or beneficiaries a power of withdrawal over the transferred property. Such a presently exercisable power allows the holder (beneficiary or beneficiaries) to get the transferred property outright and hence makes the gift one of a present interest eligible for the annual exclusion. This is the principle behind the use of *Crummey powers.* Donors normally want to make gifts that will qualify for the per-donee annual exclusion if possible.

<sup>5</sup>An educational organization for this purpose is one that normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and has a regularly enrolled body of students who are in attendance at the place where its educational activities are carried on. It can be seen that this definition can embrace a relatively wide range of organizations. Whether it would go as far as nursery school or other preschool programs depends on the facts of the case.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose, for example, that Gary would like to help his 21-yearold granddaughter through medical school. Gary can pay the \$40,000-per-year medical school tuition directly to the school and also give his granddaughter \$13,000 (indexed)6 each year under the per-donee annual exclusion. He can also pay his granddaughter's medical expenses (including health insurance premiums) directly to the providers.7 None of these gifts will be subject to gift taxation since they are under the exclusion for transfers for educational and medical expenses and the per-donee annual exclusion.

It may also be useful at this point to relate these gift tax exclusions to the GST tax, which will be covered later in this chapter. In this situation, Gary's granddaughter is a *skip person* for GST purposes (i.e., she is two or more generations younger than the transferor—Gary) and Gary's gifts to her are *direct skips* for GST tax purposes. However, since these direct skips are nontaxable outright gifts under the annual exclusion and the exclusion for transfers for educational and medical expenses, they are not taxable for GST tax purposes as well. However, with regard to annual exclusion gifts in trust, the situation is more complex. The GST tax imposes special conditions on such gifts, which are described later.

**Federal Gift Tax Marital Deduction** When married persons make gifts to each other, an unlimited federal gift tax marital deduction normally applies. This generally parallels the unlimited federal estate tax marital deduction that is explained elsewhere in this chapter and in Chapter 28. It operates as a deduction from a donor's taxable transfers to arrive at taxable gifts and hence allows gifts between spouses to be free of federal gift tax.

*Gifts to U.S. Citizen Spouses:* Before a deduction is allowed, gifts to a U.S. citizen spouse must be made in a way that qualifies for the marital deduction. The methods for qualifying property for the marital deduction are described in Chapter 28.

<sup>7</sup> In fact, he could make similar gifts to his son, daughter-in-law, and other persons.

<sup>6</sup>As we shall see later in this chapter, if Gary is married at the time he makes the gift, he can split the annual gift with his wife, and effectively they both can give up to \$26,000 per year to each donee (their granddaughter in this case) in cash outright or in appreciated securities, since their granddaughter probably will be in a lower capital gains tax bracket than Gary and his wife.

*Gifts to Non–U.S. Citizen Spouses:* These gifts are treated differently. For gifts made after July 13, 1988, the gift tax marital deduction does not apply. Instead, there is a special \$133,000 (in 2009) gift tax annual exclusion for such transfers. This exclusion applies each year to transfers of a present interest to noncitizen spouses, provided the transfers would have qualified for the marital deduction had the spouse been a U.S. citizen. This annual exclusion is indexed for inflation.

**Federal Gift Tax Charitable Deduction** As noted in Chapter 19, there is an unlimited charitable deduction for gifts to eligible charities.

## **Gift Splitting by Married Persons**

Married persons can split any gifts that either spouse makes while they are married. Thus, if either spouse makes a gift to a third person, it can be treated for tax purposes as if made one-half by the donor-spouse and onehalf by the other spouse, provided the other spouse consents to the gift on a gift tax return filed by the donor. Suppose, for example, that Husband wants to give outright \$26,000 of common stock he owns in his own name to his adult daughter in one year. If Wife consents to the gift, the \$26,000 gift is treated as a \$13,000 gift by Husband and a \$13,000 gift by Wife. Both these gifts would be within their \$13,000 (indexed) annual exclusions and hence not taxable.

To elect gift splitting, both spouses must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Also, if gift splitting is elected in a particular year, all gifts made in that year by either spouse must be split. However, for the next year and each subsequent year, they can decide whether or not to split their gifts.

## **Who Owes the Gift Tax and Who Must File a Return?**

The donor owes any gift tax payable. Sometimes, a gift is made on condition that the donee will pay the gift tax. This is called a *net gift,* and the gift tax paid by the donee is deducted from the value of the gift property to determine the taxable gift. A donor must file a gift tax return8 when his or her transfers of present interests exceed the annual exclusion and the other exclusions. A donor also must file a gift tax return for all transfers of future interests and in cases where gift splitting by spouses is involved.9

<sup>8</sup>This is IRS Form 709 entitled United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return.

<sup>9</sup>When split gifts are not taxable because they are within the annual exclusions, a short-form return may be filed.

## **Valuation of Gift Property**

**General Principles** The general principles of valuing interests for federal gift and estate tax purposes are reasonably straightforward. The value of a transfer is equal to the fair market value of the gift property (minus any payment made by the donee) as of the date a completed transfer takes place. This *fair market value* generally is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, with neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell, and with both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts. This is referred to as the *willing buyer*/*willing seller test.* When property has a ready market, such as for stocks, bonds, and commodities traded on organized exchanges, or for mutual fund shares, this value can be determined easily.10 On the other hand, for property with limited marketability, such as closely held business interests, family limited partnership (FLP) interests, real estate, and art or antiques, there may be valuation disputes and negotiations between donor-taxpayers and the IRS.

**Valuation Discounts and Premiums** The values of certain property interests under this willing buyer/willing seller test may be less than (discounted from) the underlying value of property in the interest because of the legal and economic nature of the interests. This may be true, for example, because of lack of control by or lack of marketability of the interest. Correspondingly, the values of other property interests may be more than the underlying value of property in the interest. This may occur, for example, because of the goingconcern value of a business (goodwill factor) or because the holder of the interest is in control of a business or property (control premium).

Valuation in this context is a complex issue. However, valuation discounts may be important in estate planning and underlie such planning techniques as giving interests in FLPs, as covered in Chapter 27. There also may be differences of opinion on such discounts between donors (and their advisers) and the IRS. In some cases, disputes, compromises, and even litigation result. Some common discounts and premium and other valuation concepts are outlined next.

**Discount for Lack of Marketability** This discount from otherwise calculated value reflects the fact that interests in closely held entities have no ready market and hence are difficult to sell. This makes them much less attractive to a willing buyer than would be publicly traded securities. Also, closely held

<sup>10</sup>For publicly traded stocks and bonds, it is the average of the high and low selling prices on the valuation date. For mutual funds, it is the bid or redemption price on the valuation date.

entities may place restrictions on an owner's ability to sell his or her interest to outsiders. This discount may be applied first in the valuation process.

**Discount for Lack of Control (Minority Interest Discount)** The owner of a minority interest cannot control the operations of an entity. This makes such interests much less attractive to a willing buyer. This may be applied after the lack of marketability discount in the valuation process.

**Control Premium** On the other hand, an interest that represents control of an entity may be valued at a premium over an otherwise calculated value.

**Fractional Interest Discount** This discount may arise because only a partial interest in property (usually real estate) is transferred, and hence the owner of the fractional interest normally must act with the other owner or owners to deal with the property or must pay the expense to partition it. Thus, a willing buyer normally will pay less for a fractional interest than its pro rata share of the property's value.

**Blockage Discounts** These are discounts that may be applied to transfers of large blocks of publicly traded securities. The reason for such a discount is that the sale of such a large block may depress the normal market price for the securities.

**Valuation of Life Estates, Term Interests, Remainders, Reversions, and Certain Annuities** As noted in Chapter 3, transfers of such interests are valued according to factors corresponding to interest rates (Section 7520 rates) that the federal government publishes monthly.

## **Effect of Chapter 14 of the IRC on Valuation**

This chapter of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted to redress certain perceived valuation abuses involving transfers between family members. Nevertheless, there are planning techniques for making gifts within the rules of Chapter 14 that may yield significant estate planning benefits.

To give a brief overview of Chapter 14, Section 2701 applies to the valuation freeze techniques that were used with respect to gifts of corporate stock (such as common stock) or comparable partnership interests to younger family members with the retention of senior stock (such as preferred stock) or comparable partnership interests by older family members. Unless the retained senior interests meet certain requirements, Chapter 14 values them at zero for transfer tax purposes. Thus, as a practical matter, this has essentially ended this valuation freeze approach purely for tax purposes.

Section 2702 applies to transfers in trust when the grantor retains an interest in the trust and then transfers the remainder interest to a family member. Unless certain exceptions apply, the grantor's retained interest is valued at zero and the full value of the trust corpus is assigned to the gift of the remainder interest. Thus, the exceptions are important for planning purposes. They are PRTs, QPRTs, GRATs, GRUTs, and retained term interests in certain tangible, nondepreciable property. When one of these exceptions applies, the grantor's retained interest is valued using IRS tables, and only the difference between the value of the property placed in the trust and the value of the grantor's retained interest is a taxable transfer (gift) to the family member. The planning possibilities inherent in these exceptions are considered in Chapter 27.

Section 2703 imposes certain conditions on option agreements, rights to acquire property, or restrictions on the sale or use of property between family members to assure that they are bona fide agreements. These conditions apply to business buy–sell agreements and are covered in Chapter 31.

Finally, Section 2704 deals with the effect on value of certain lapsing voting rights or liquidation rights in a corporation or partnership when the person holding the rights and members of his or her family control the corporation or partnership before and after the lapse.

# **Federal Estate Tax**

It is said that nothing is certain except death and taxes. Here we are dealing with both. The federal estate tax is an excise tax imposed on the passing of property to others at death. At this point, we shall describe the nature of the federal estate tax. Planning to reduce or defer the estate tax is covered in Chapters 27 through 29.

## **Structure of the Federal Estate Tax**

#### **Gross estate (Items included are listed next)**

*Minus:* Certain estate settlement deductions (i.e., estate administration expenses; funeral expenses; claims against the estate; unpaid mortgages or other indebtedness on property whose value, undiminished by the mortgages or indebtedness, is included in the gross estate; and casualty losses incurred during the settlement of the estate).11

*Note:* The gross estate minus these deductions equals what has been called the adjusted gross estate. This figure still is used to determine such things as eligibility for a Section 303 redemption of corporate stock and installment

<sup>11</sup>Estate administration expenses can be taken either on the estate's income tax return or on the estate tax return. If the executor elects to take them on the income tax return, they cannot be deducted from the gross estate.

payment of the estate tax under Section 6166. Modifications of it also may be used for other purposes.

*Minus:* Marital deduction (which may be up to the full amount, that is, 100 percent, of property included in the gross estate that passes to a surviving spouse so as to qualify for the marital deduction).

*Minus:* Charitable deduction.

*Equals—*

#### **Taxable estate**

*Plus:* Adjusted taxable gifts (post-1976 taxable gifts other than those included in the gross estate)

*Equals—*

**Tentative tax base**, to which the unified transfer tax rates are applied to produce—

#### **Federal estate tax on the tentative tax base**

*Minus:* Credit for gift taxes payable (at current rates) on post-1976 taxable gifts

*Equals—*

#### **Federal estate tax before application of other credits**

*Minus:* Applicable credit amount (unified credit)

*Minus:* Other credits

*Equals—*

#### **Federal estate tax payable**

It may be noted that the purpose of adding any post-1976 taxable gifts to the taxable estate to arrive at the tentative tax base (to which the unified transfer tax rates are applied) and then deducting a credit equal to any post-1976 gift taxes payable is to have the amount of any previous lifetime gifts serve to increase the unified transfer tax brackets applicable to estate assets that pass at death. At present, however, effectively the estate tax rate is a flat 45 percent of the amount over the applicable exclusion amount.

## **What Is in the Gross Estate?**

The gross estate is the starting point for determining how much estate tax an estate must pay. In general, it includes the following items.

**Property Owned at Death** All property a decedent owned in his or her own name or had an interest in (such as the decedent's share of tenancies in common or community property) at the time of death will be in the decedent's gross estate.

**Life Insurance on the Decedent's Life** The gross estate includes proceeds of life insurance policies on a decedent's life if he or she had ownership rights in the policy (incidents of ownership) at the time of death or if the policy was payable to the estate. It also includes the proceeds of life insurance policies given away within three years of death.

**Joint Tenancies (WROS)** In this case, the gross estate of the first joint owner to die includes one-half the value of property held jointly (WROS) by a husband and wife (fractional interest rule) or the full value of property held jointly (WROS) with other than a husband or wife, except to the extent it can be shown the surviving owner contributed to the purchase price of the property (consideration furnished rule) from property never received by gift from the deceased owner.

**General Powers of Appointment** Property over which a person held a general power of appointment at his or her death will be in the decedent's gross estate. On the other hand, possession of a special or limited power will not cause inclusion in the holder's gross estate.

**Annuities** This item includes in a decedent's gross estate the actuarial value of payments a surviving joint annuitant may receive after the decedent's death. These might be from a joint and last survivor annuity form, for example. It also includes a beneficiary's rights to the value of annuity payments (account balances) a decedent has not yet received as of his or her death. These survivors' benefits might come from the various qualified retirement plans, traditional and Roth IRAs,12 nonqualified annuities, TSAs, and nonqualified deferred-compensation plans. These benefits, other than from Roth IRAs, also are IRD. On the other hand, if annuity payments cease at a person's death and nothing is payable to a survivor or beneficiary thereafter (as from a straight life annuity, for example), nothing will be in the decedent's gross estate.

**Revocable Transfers** If a person transfers property but has the right to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate the enjoyment of the property as of the date of death, the value of the property will be included in his or her gross estate. It also will be in the gross estate if the decedent relinquished such right within three years of death. The inclusion applies regardless of the capacity in which the person is acting (e.g., as a trustee) and regardless of whether the person

<sup>12</sup>While benefits from Roth IRAs are free from federal income tax, they are included in a deceased owner's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes.

must act alone or in conjunction with any other person.13 This means, for example, that if a grantor of an irrevocable trust has the right to change a trust beneficiary, the amount received by a beneficiary, or the timing of benefits to a beneficiary, this provision will apply and the corpus will be in his or her gross estate. It also will apply, of course, to revocable living trusts at the grantor's death.

Grantors of irrevocable *inter vivos* (living) trusts often want to retain at least some control over the trust, usually by being a trustee. A grantor can be a trustee, and as trustee can exercise certain powers over trust investments and other matters of trust administration without adverse estate tax consequences. However, care must be taken that a grantor or grantor-trustee does not have such powers over the beneficial enjoyment of trust corpus that it will cause the property to be in the grantor's gross estate at his or her death. On the other hand, unrestricted discretionary powers over distribution of principal and income to trust beneficiaries and other matters can be placed in the hands of an independent trustee or cotrustee (who is neither related to nor subordinate to the grantor). Also, a grantor-trustee of an irrevocable trust can have the power to invade trust corpus for or control income flows to trust beneficiaries, provided the power is limited by an ascertainable standard (i.e., for the health, education, support, or maintenance of the beneficiaries), without having the trust property included in the grantor's gross estate. Furthermore, a grantor can have the power to remove one trustee and appoint another individual or corporate trustee in its place, provided the new trustee is not the grantor and is not related or subordinate to the grantor. This can be done without causing the trust property to be included in the grantor's gross estate.

**Transfers with Retained Life Estate** This is another provision that may result in lifetime transfers being included in a decedent's gross estate.14 The gross estate includes the value of all property a decedent transferred by trust or otherwise if the decedent retained for his or her lifetime, or for any period not ascertainable without reference to the decedent's death, or for any period that does not in fact end before his or her death, the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, the transferred property. This inclusion provision [IRC Section 2036(a)] also applies if the decedent retained the right, alone or in conjunction with any other person, to designate the persons who will possess or enjoy the property or the income from the property. In effect, when a transferor (e.g., a grantor of a trust) transfers property but retains a life income from the property or a lifetime power to determine

<sup>13</sup> Section 2038 of the IRC deals with revocable and similar transfers.

<sup>14</sup>Transfers with retained life estates are covered in Section 2036 of the IRC.

who will enjoy the property, the value of the property at the date of death will be in the transferor's gross estate. This is also true when a transferor retains a lifetime right to vote the shares of transferred stock in a controlled corporation.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume that Susan Smith, age 65 and in good health, transfers \$1 million of stocks and bonds to an irrevocable trust with the income payable to herself for her lifetime, and at her death the trust corpus would go in equal shares to her two children or their issue as remainderpersons. Susan dies 20 years later at age 85 when the trust corpus is worth \$3 million. Since Susan retained a life income (life estate) in the transferred property, the value of this trust at her death, \$3 million, will be in Susan's gross estate.

**Transfers Taking Effect at Death** The gross estate also includes the value of property transferred by a decedent during his or her life, when the possession or enjoyment of the property as owner can be obtained only by surviving the decedent and the decedent retained a reversionary interest in the property with a value immediately before death of more than 5 percent of the property's value.

**Transfers within Three Years of Death** In general, property given away during life is not in the donor's gross estate at death. This applies regardless of how close in time the date of death was to the date of the gift. However, there are several exceptions to this general rule. We have already seen that if there has been a lifetime transfer and the transferor retains or has certain rights or interests in the transferred property (e.g., transfers with retained life estates, transfers taking effect at death, and revocable transfers) as of his or her death, the value of the transferred property as of the date of death will be included in the gross estate. In addition, transfers of life insurance policies by a person on his or her life within three years of death will cause the full life insurance proceeds to be in the insured's gross estate. Furthermore, relinquishment of retained rights or powers in transferred property that otherwise would cause its inclusion in the gross estate, as just noted, within three years of death will result in the property being included in the gross estate. Finally, the gross estate includes the amount of any gift tax paid on gifts made by the decedent or his or her spouse within three years of the decedent's death. This is referred to as the *gift tax gross-up.*

**Marital Deduction Property in a Q-TIP Trust** One way to qualify property for the federal estate tax marital deduction is to leave it to a surviving spouse in a qualified terminable interest property (Q-TIP) trust. When this is done, the property in the Q-TIP trust will be in the surviving spouse's gross estate at his or her death. However, the surviving spouse may require reimbursement for the estate tax payable on the Q-TIP property from the Q-TIP trust.

## **Property Not in the Gross Estate**

The property included in the gross estate consists of all property and property interests, as just described, of a decedent who was a U.S. citizen or resident wherever the property is situated. In other words, only the categories of property specifically enumerated in the IRC are in the gross estate; other property interests are not.

For planning purposes, we often are concerned with keeping property out of the gross estate, as well as with using estate tax deductions and credits wisely. Planners are interested in ways of giving persons economic advantages in property without having it included in their gross estates when they die. In this regard, when property is placed in irrevocable trusts for beneficiaries (either *inter vivos* or testamentary trusts), substantial rights and powers can be given to the beneficiaries or exercised on their behalf over the trust corpus and income without having the corpus included in the beneficiaries' gross estates upon their death. These have been referred to as *almost-owner powers*  or *nontaxable ownership equivalents.* These nontaxable interests and powers are as follows:

- N The right to trust income for the beneficiary's lifetime (or a term of years).
- N The beneficiary's being a permissible distributee of trust corpus at the discretion of an independent trustee.
- N The beneficiary's possession of a special power of appointment over trust corpus.
- N The beneficiary's possession of a power to withdraw or invade trust corpus for himself or herself subject to an ascertainable standard related to the beneficiary's health, education, support, or maintenance.
- N The right in the beneficiary's discretion to withdraw up to the larger of \$5,000 or 5 percent of the corpus each year. At the beneficiary's death, at most, only the amount that could have been withdrawn in the year of death can be included in the beneficiary's gross estate. There can be complications with such 5 and 5 powers, but they are available for beneficiaries if desired.

Naturally, not all of these non-estate-taxable interests and powers need be given by a grantor to trust beneficiaries. However, they are available to the extent they are desired or needed.

## **Federal Estate Tax Marital Deduction**

This often is an important tax-deferring device for married estate owners. Planning for its use will be considered in Chapter 28.

**Transfers to U.S. Citizen Spouses** The marital deduction operates as a deduction from a decedent's gross estate to arrive at the taxable estate and allows unlimited transfers between spouses free of federal estate taxation. However, property in a decedent's gross estate must pass to his or her surviving spouse in a way that qualifies for the marital deduction, as explained in Chapter 28.

**Transfers to Non–U.S. Citizen Spouses** Property passing to spouses who are not U.S. citizens is treated differently. A transfer can be made to a *qualified domestic trust* (QDOT), which is a trust for a noncitizen surviving spouse who has elected QDOT treatment, meets certain other requirements, and qualifies for the marital deduction. At the first spouse's death (the U.S. citizen or resident), it operates as a deduction from the gross estate to arrive at the taxable estate. It applies to distributions of principal during the surviving spouse's lifetime as well as the value of the trust principal at his or her death. The estate tax is calculated as if the taxable assets from the QDOT were in the first spouse's gross estate.

## **Federal Estate Tax Charitable Deduction**

This deduction parallels the gift tax charitable deduction. It is unlimited and operates as a deduction from the gross estate to arrive at the taxable estate.

## **Federal Estate Tax Deduction for State Death Taxes**

This is a deduction for any state death taxes actually paid on property included in the gross estate.

## **Applicable Credit Amount (Unified Credit)**

This credit was described previously.15

15Note again the difference between a deduction and a credit. A *deduction* is taken from a potentially taxable amount to arrive at a tax base to which the tax rates are applied (such as the marital deduction and charitable deduction from the gross estate to arrive at the taxable estate). A *credit* is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the tax itself (such as the applicable credit amount from the federal estate tax). Obviously, a credit is more valuable than a deduction.

## **Other Credits**

There can be several other credits to reduce the federal estate tax otherwise payable. They come after the unified credit in the following order of priority.

**Credit for Gift Taxes** This credit is for gift taxes on taxable gifts made before 1977 that are included in the gross estate at death.

**Credit for Foreign Death Taxes** This is a credit for death taxes paid to foreign governments or to a possession of the United States when a U.S. citizen or resident decedent has property in the countries or possessions.

**Credit for Tax on Prior Transfers (TPT Credit)** When the heirs or beneficiaries of a decedent die within 10 years after or 2 years before the decedent's death, there is a decreasing credit against the estate tax payable by the heir's or beneficiary's estate for property received from the decedent that was also taxable in the decedent's estate. This credit is intended to redress or ameliorate the effect of property being taxed several times within a relatively short period. The amount of the credit depends on the time elapsing between the two deaths.

## **Valuation of Property in the Gross Estate**

**General Principles** The general principles of valuing property and property interests for federal estate tax purposes are generally the same as for gift tax purposes, with some special rules. The value generally is the fair market value of property in the gross estate, either at the date of death or as of an alternate valuation date six months after the date of death at the executor's election. Fair market value is determined under the willing buyer/willing seller test described previously.

**Alternate Valuation Date** An executor might elect this date if the value of the estate has declined since the date of death.16 If elected, all assets must be valued at the alternate valuation date. The election can be made only if it actually will decrease the size of the gross estate and the estate tax payable. The present step-up in income tax basis at death rule applies to the valuation date actually used. Therefore, the basis of assets will be lower if the alternate valuation date is elected. If the alternate valuation date is elected and property is disposed of during the six months after death, it is valued as of the date of disposition.

16For historical interest, the reason an alternative valuation date is in the tax code is that at the beginning of the Great Depression of the 1930s, many estate assets declined so precipitously in value from the date of death until the tax was due that, in some cases, they actually were worth less than the estate tax due.

**Valuation Discounts and Premium** The valuation discounts and premium applying to some types of assets, discussed earlier with respect to gift taxation, also may apply to the federal estate tax values of those assets.

**Special Use Valuation** This special valuation provision (contained in Section 2032A of the IRC) applies to real property located in the United States (qualified real property) used in farming or in a closely held business conducted by the decedent or a family member. The provision allows a decedent's executor to elect to value such property according to its current use (e.g., as a farm or part of a closely held business) rather than according to its possible *highest and best use* (e.g., as land for a housing development or industrial park). Normally, fair market value of real property is based on its highest and best use. The reduction in value from highest-and-best-use value cannot exceed \$1,000,000 in 2009 (indexed for inflation in \$10,000 increments). A number of requirements must be met to qualify for specialuse valuation. However, under the proper circumstances, it can be a valuable provision for reducing estate taxes.

## **Filing the Tax Return and Payment of the Tax**

**General Principles** When a federal estate tax return17 is required (generally when the gross estate of a decedent who is a U.S. citizen or resident exceeds the applicable exclusion amount), the basic rule is that it must be filed and the tax paid within 9 months after the decedent's death. However, the IRS normally will grant a 6-month extension for filing the return, so as a practical matter, the executor may have up to 15 months after death to file the estate tax return. The IRS also may grant an extension of time to pay the tax due, but this requires the executor to show reasonable cause why the tax cannot be paid when due.

**Election to Pay Tax on Closely Held Businesses in Installments** Section 6166 of the IRC allows an executor to elect to pay the estate tax attributable to certain closely held business interests in 10 equal annual installments, beginning 5 years after the date the tax is otherwise due. This effectively allows payment over a 14-year period. Only interest need be paid for the first four years. However, the interest rate on the estate tax deferred on the first \$1,330,000, in 2009 (indexed for inflation in \$10,000 increments), of business value is only 2 percent, and the rate on the balance is 45 percent of the IRS underpayment rate. This interest is not deductible as an estate

<sup>17</sup>The estate tax return is IRS Form 706.

administration expense.18 There are a number of requirements to qualify for this installment payment option, but Section 6166 can be attractive for the estates of closely held business owners if they are eligible.

**Tax Apportionment and Tax Provisions** The IRC places the burden of paying the federal estate tax on the executor of a decedent's estate. However, federal and state apportionment statutes may allow the executor to recover some of the tax from interests includible in the gross estate but not in the probate estate.

The estate owner in his or her will or other document can override these apportionment statutes and indicate from what interest or interests in his or her gross estate any death taxes are to be paid. This is referred to as a *tax clause or provision.* Otherwise, death taxes may reduce interests the estate owner may prefer not to be reduced by them. For example, it normally is not desirable for death taxes to be paid from interests that are going to qualify for the marital deduction. If they are, it will correspondingly reduce the marital deduction and increase estate taxes in a circular fashion.19 It also may not be desirable for death taxes to be paid from qualified retirement plan or IRA account balances because it would reduce future income tax deferral (or tax-free growth). A tax clause, for example, might specify that death taxes are to be paid from the residuary probate estate that does not qualify for the marital deduction. Of course, there must be enough liquid assets in, or available to, the probate estate to do this; otherwise, the tax will be apportioned elsewhere. This is a matter of providing adequate estate liquidity.

# **Federal Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Tax Basic Concepts**

The rationale behind this tax is that a federal transfer tax should be imposed on the transfer of wealth by each generation to the next. The GST tax may apply to a direct skip, a taxable termination, or a taxable distribution from a transferor to a skip person. These are referred to as *taxable transfers.* In essence, the tax applies, with certain exceptions, when a transfer of property misses, or *skips,* a generation in terms of the property not being subject to gift or estate tax in that generation.

19Under equitable apportionment principles, there should be no tax apportioned to marital deduction property because it does not generate any of the estate tax.

<sup>18</sup>Note that other interest paid or payable on debt incurred to finance payment of federal estate taxes may be deductible as an estate administration expense, depending on the circumstances. This, in itself, may offer planning possibilities.

As a planning matter, payment of a GST tax normally should be avoided. This is because the GST tax rate effectively is equal to the maximum federal estate tax rate and a gift tax or an estate tax also will be paid on the original transfer. Planning to avoid GST tax may involve making transfers that are exempt or otherwise not subject to GST tax, as explained later in this section, or not having transfers actually skip an intervening generation's estate.

## **Skip Person**

A skip person is a natural person assigned to a generation two or more generations younger than that of the transferor of property. Thus, a transferor's grandchildren or great-grandchildren are examples of skip persons.20 A skip person can also be a trust, in which all interests are held by a skip person or persons (or no person holds an interest in the trust and at no time can a distribution be made to a non-skip person). In essence, this means the trust is exclusively for one or more skip persons (e.g., a grandchild or a grandchild and his or her issue).

## **Transferor**

The transferor is the person originally subject to transfer taxation. It is the donor for transfers subject to gift taxation and the decedent in the case of transfers subject to estate taxation. It is necessary to identify the transferor so generations can be counted in determining whether there has been a taxable transfer to a skip person.

If a transfer is made by an original transferor in trust and the corpus of the trust is included in a beneficiary's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes (such as if the beneficiary had a general power of appointment over the trust corpus at his or her death), the transferor for GST tax purposes changes and the beneficiary becomes the new transferor. This is because the transfer did not skip the beneficiary's estate. This can be important in planning to avoid the GST tax.

However, a special election is permitted when property is given or left by one spouse to the other in a Q-TIP trust to qualify for the marital deduction. In this case, the executor of the first spouse to die can elect to have that spouse continue to be treated as the transferor of the trust corpus for GST tax purposes. This is called a reverse Q-TIP election. However, since under EGTRRA, the GST tax lifetime exemption will be equal to the estate tax

<sup>20</sup>Generations are assigned according to lineal descendants (parents, children, grandchildren, etc.), starting from the grandparents of the transferor, or if the person is not a lineal descendent, by the number of years younger than the transferor. Under this non-lineal-descendent rule, if a person is more than 37½ years younger than the transferor, he or she is a skip person.

applicable exclusion amount for 2004 and thereafter, the reverse Q-TIP election has substantially diminished in importance for planning purposes.

#### **Generation-Skipping Transfers Not Subject to GST Tax**

Since the GST tax normally is to be avoided, it is important to know which GSTs will escape taxation.

**GST Exemption** Each person making generation-skipping transfers (a transferor) is allowed an aggregate exemption, which can be allocated to otherwise taxable transfers made during the transferor's lifetime or at his or her death. Under EGTRRA, for 2004 and thereafter, the GST exemption will be equal to the federal estate tax applicable exclusion amount and will not be indexed for inflation. The GST tax rate also is equal to the maximum federal estate tax rate.

The effect of allocating part or all of an individual's exemption to an otherwise taxable transfer is that it becomes partially or totally free of GST tax. Proper planning calls for allocating one's exemption to make a transfer totally free of GST tax (i.e., to allocate exemption equal to the value of the transfer), rather than make a transfer only partially exempt. For example, suppose in 2009, Grandmother gives \$500,000 in an irrevocable trust that provides a life income to her adult grandson and then the remainder to his issue. Grandmother is the transferor and the trust is a skip person. It is a direct skip (i.e., a direct transfer to a skip person) because the transfer is subject to gift taxation (with Grandmother as donor) and the trust is a skip person. If \$500,000 of Grandmother's \$3,500,000 exemption is allocated to this trust, it will be completely exempt for GST tax purposes.21

In the case of lifetime direct skips (such as just illustrated) and "indirect skips" as defined in the law, the tax law automatically allocates enough

21The calculation of any GST tax is complicated. Technically, the GST tax rate applied to taxable amounts (e.g., the \$500,000 direct skip here), called the *applicable rate,* is the maximum federal estate tax rate times an inclusion ratio. The *inclusion ratio* is 1 minus an applicable fraction. The *applicable fraction* is determined by dividing the value of the property transferred minus any federal or state death taxes and any charitable deduction (or \$500,000 in this example) by the amount of the GST tax exemption allocated to the taxable transfer (again, \$500,000 in this example). In this illustration, the applicable fraction is 1 (\$500,000 ÷ \$500,000 = 1) and the inclusion ratio is 0 (1 – 1 [the applicable fraction] = 0). The maximum estate tax rate times zero equals a zero applicable rate, and \$500,000 times zero equals zero GST tax. Of course, if no exemption amount is allocated to a taxable transfer, the applicable rate is the maximum federal estate tax rate; if less than the value of the property transferred is allocated, the applicable rate will be greater than zero but less than the maximum rate, depending on the percentage of value transferred that was allocated. However, as noted in the text, it is not good planning to have an inclusion ratio at a rate greater than zero (i.e., to pay a GST tax).

(if available) of the transferor's exemption to make the transfer totally exempt, unless the transferor affirmatively elects otherwise. For certain transfers, exemption also can be retroactively allocated. However, a transferor can determine the allocation pattern by making an allocation on a tax return. An allocation also can be expressed as a formula. Such a formula might provide, for example, that the maximum amount or share is to be allocated to a generation-skipping trust, say, for grandchildren, so that the inclusion ratio (see Footnote 21) does not exceed zero. After EGTRRA (with its increasing GST exemptions), such formula provisions should be reviewed to see that they will not result in funding a generation-skipping trust to a greater extent than the transferor may have originally intended.

**Per-Donee Annual Exclusion** Direct skips (i.e., direct transfers to a skip person) made outright to a donee that are exempt from gift taxation because of the per-donee annual exclusion are also exempt from the GST tax. Thus, for example, if Grandfather gives \$26,000 outright to each of his three adult grandchildren in 2009 (or \$78,000 in total), and Grandmother (his wife) agrees to split the gifts, all the gifts would fall under the gift tax annual exclusion and would also be exempt from the GST tax.

However, the situation is more complicated when gifts are made in trust. For direct skip transfers made after March 31, 1988, in trust, even though they qualify for the gift tax annual exclusion (such as through use of Crummey powers, as described in Chapter 27), they will not be exempt from the GST tax unless the trust provides that a single skip person as beneficiary is the only permissible recipient of trust income or corpus during his or her lifetime and has an interest in the trust so that the corpus will be included in the beneficiary's gross estate at his or her death (if the trust does not terminate before his or her death). In effect, this means that for a trust that qualifies for the gift tax annual exclusion also to be exempt on this basis from the GST tax, the trust can have only one skip person beneficiary and can skip only once (normally only one generation), because the corpus (and income) must either be paid to the beneficiary during his or her lifetime or be included in his or her gross estate at death. If more than one skip is desired, the transferor would have to allocate part of his or her exemption to the trust.

**Unlimited Exclusion for Transfers for Educational and Medical Expenses** In similar fashion, unlimited transfers made directly to educational organizations for tuition or directly to providers for medical expenses for skip persons, which if made during the person's lifetime would be excluded from gift taxation, also are not subject to GST tax. This exclusion applies to taxable distributions from trusts (to be defined next), as well as to outright transfers during the transferor's lifetime.

**Grandfathered Trusts** When the GST tax system was substantially revised in 1986, certain existing trusts were grandfathered and made exempt from GST taxation. These are irrevocable trusts created on or before September 25, 1985, and certain revocable trusts or testamentary trusts, if the person died before 1987.

## **Types of Generation-Skipping Transfers (Taxable Transfers)**

**Direct Skips** These are transfers of an interest in property directly to a skip person (a natural person or a trust meeting the requirements to be a skip person) that are subject to either gift tax or estate tax. The taxable amount is the value of the property received by the transferee (the skip person), and any GST tax must be paid by the transferor.22

**Taxable Terminations** These are terminations by death, lapse of time, release of a power, or otherwise of an interest in property held in trust, unless immediately after such termination a non-skip person has an interest in the property or at no time after such termination can a distribution, including distributions on termination, be made from such trust to a skip person. The taxable amount is the value of the property with respect to which the taxable termination occurred, reduced by certain allowable expenses. Any GST tax payable must be paid by the trustee.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that Mrs. Johnson, a widow with a sizeable estate, has two adult children, a son and a daughter, each of whom also has two children. Both the son and daughter are successful in their careers, and they and their spouses are accumulating goodsized estates on their own. Therefore, Mrs. Johnson has decided that in her will, she will leave her residuary estate (net estate) in equal trusts, for each of her children. The terms of these trusts provide that trust income is to be paid to or among the child, the child's children, or their issue, or accumulated in the trust at an independent trustee's sole discretion (i.e., a sprinkle or spray power over income). At each child's death, the corpus of his or her trust will pass outright to that child's children (Mrs. Johnson's grandchildren) or their issue in equal shares. These would be generation-skipping trusts (assuming Mrs. Johnson's son

<sup>22</sup>Except for direct skips from trusts, in which case, the tax is paid by the trustee.

and daughter are alive when the transfer is made, i.e., when Mrs. Johnson dies), and the grandchildren would be skip persons.

Assume now that Mrs. Johnson dies, leaving a residuary estate (after debts, expenses, and federal estate and other death taxes on her estate) of \$8,000,000, so that \$4,000,000 funds the trusts for each child. Furthermore, suppose that after 20 years, her son dies, when the corpus of his trusts have grown to \$9,000,000. Upon the son's death, there would be a taxable termination of his interest in the trusts, and this would cause the then-fair market value of the corpus to be a generation-skipping transfer.

In this situation, as a planning matter, it normally would have been better for Mrs. Johnson's executor after her death to have divided the children's trusts into two or more trusts (under authority in the will to do so) and then allocate enough of Mrs. Johnson's GST exemption to one or more trusts to make the trusts completely exempt from GST tax. Then, each child might have been given a general power of appointment over the corpus of the other (nonexempt) trusts or given the property outright.

**Taxable Distributions** These are any distributions from a trust to a skip person. The taxable amount is the value of the property received by the transferee (skip person), minus certain expenses. The transferee is liable for any GST tax. If, for example, the trusts created after Mrs. Johnson's death in the previous example had made distributions to one of her grandchildren other than for educational or medical expenses, it would have been a taxable distribution.

#### **Estate Tax Inclusion Period (ETIP)**

When an individual makes a lifetime transfer and retains an interest in the property such that it would be included in his or her gross estate if the individual died immediately, no allocation of the GST exemption can be made until the earlier of the end of the period during which the property could be included in the individual's gross estate if he or she died (the estate tax inclusion period) or the individual's death. This rule can affect use of the GST exemption in connection with gifts with a retained income or use interest. For example, if Grandfather sets up a 10-year QPRT, as described in Chapter 27, and designates his granddaughter as the remainderperson to receive the residence after the 10-year period, he generally cannot allocate any of his exemption to the trust until the earlier of his death or the end of the 10-year period.

# **Possible Estate Tax Changes**

As stated earlier in this chapter, many commentators believe changes will be made in the estate tax system before 2010 to avoid estate tax repeal, the consequences of EGTRRA's sunset provision, and for other reasons. Of course, as of this writing no one can be certain of such changes, particularly in the area of tax legislation, but the following are considered likely to occur. Naturally, other changes also may be made.

## **No Estate Tax Repeal, Applicable Exclusion, and Tax Rate**

The estate tax (and GST tax) will not be repealed in 2010, the applicable exclusion amount probably willl remain at the present \$3,500,000 (with the corresponding unified credit at \$1,455,800), and the estate tax top rate probably will remain at 45 persent.

## **Transferability (Portability) of Unused Unified Credit Between Spouses**

To simplify estate planning, it is very possible that the law will be changed to allow any unused unified credit at the death of the first spouse to die to be transferred to the surviving spouse and added to his or her own unified credit. This effectively would presently give married couples a combined \$7,000,000 applicable exclusion amount, no matter who dies first. This would avoid the need, purely for estate tax reasons, for credit-shelter trusts and gifts between spouses so each spouse's estate can use his or her full unified credit as described in Chapter 28.
