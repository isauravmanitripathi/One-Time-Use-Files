# **Health and Disability Income Insurance**

*Competence Objectives for This Chapter* After reading this chapter, planners should understand:

- N The sources of health insurance protection
- N The features of individual disability income insurance policies
- N Social Security disability benefits
- N The features of employer-provided group disability income insurance
- N The income tax treatment of employer-provided and individually provided disability income insurance
- N Kinds of medical expense benefits
- N Medicare benefits
- N The nature of employer-provided medical expense benefits
- N COBRA continuation rights
- N Strategies for planning for terminated health insurance coverage
- N Individual health insurance policy provisions
- N Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs)

There are two traditional types of health losses against which people should protect themselves and their families: *disability income losses* and *medical care expenses.* They are covered in this chapter. Another type of related loss *custodial care expenses—*is the subject of Chapter 23.

# **Sources of Health Insurance Protection Social Insurance**

The main social insurance programs that provide health benefits are the disability portion of the federal Social Security system; the Medicare portion of the federal Social Security system; state and federal worker's compensation laws; nonoccupational temporary disability benefits laws of some states; and, while not social insurance as such, the Medicaid program.

## **Group Coverages**

Group coverages are the predominant way of providing private health benefits in the United States. Group health coverage generally is a benefits arrangement made by an employer for its employees.

## **Individual Coverages**

Individual health policies are contracts with an insurer made by individuals to cover themselves and perhaps members of their family.

## **Franchise and Association Group Insurance**

Franchise health insurance is a mixture of the individual and group approaches. It involves issuance of individual policies to employees or to members of other groups under an arrangement with the employer or other entity. Association group insurance is similar to franchise insurance, except that it is typically issued to members of professional or trade association groups.

# **Disability Income (Loss-of-Time) Coverages Features Affecting Disability Income Coverage**

**Maximum Benefit Period** This is the maximum period that disability benefits will be paid to a disabled person. It may be expressed in weeks or months, or extending to a specified age or even for life. Generally speaking, the longer the maximum benefit period, the better is the coverage for the insured.

**Perils Insured Against** These perils normally are either *accident alone* or *accident and sickness.* Coverage of disability caused by accident only is limited in scope and normally should be avoided. Coverage generally should be purchased for both accident and sickness.

**Waiting (Elimination) Period** This is the time that must elapse after a covered disability starts before disability income benefits begin. Suppose, for example, a plan has a 30-day elimination period for accident and sickness. If an insured person becomes disabled as defined by the plan, he or she must wait 30 days after the start of disability before beginning to collect benefits.

**Definition of Disability** This important provision describes when a person is considered disabled for purposes of collecting benefits. Definitions can be structured in terms of the inability to perform occupational duties, or in terms of loss of earned income, or both.

When the definition is structured in terms of the insured's inability to perform occupational duties, there are essentially three varieties of definitions of disability in use today—the "any occupation" type, the "own occupation" type, and the so-called split definition.

As it was originally conceived, the "any occupation" type defines disability as the complete inability of the covered person to engage in any occupation whatsoever. This is a strict approach. The modern tendency is to phrase an "any occupation" definition in a way that will consider total disability as the "complete inability of the insured to engage in any gainful occupation for which he (or she) is or becomes reasonably fitted by education, training, or experience," or some similar wording. The "any occupation" approach is the least liberal from the consumer's viewpoint.

The "own occupation" type defines disability as when the covered person is "prevented from performing any and every duty pertaining to the employee's (or insured's) occupation." In some policies, this may be phrased as the insured's inability to engage in the substantial and material duties of his or her regular occupation or specialty, or some similar broader wording. This "own occupation" (or "own occ") approach is the most liberal from the consumer's viewpoint.

The split definition is a combination of these two approaches. An example is as follows:

"Total disability" means complete inability of the insured to engage in *any* [emphasis added] gainful occupation for which he (or she) is reasonably fitted by education, training, or experience; however, during the first 60 months of any period of disability, the Company (insurer) will deem the insured to be totally disabled if he (or she) is completely unable to engage in *his* (or *her*) [emphasis added] regular occupation and is not engaged in any form of gainful occupation.

This definition, in effect, applies an "own occ" definition for a specified period—60 months in this example—and then applies an "any occupation for which the insured is reasonably fitted" definition for the remainder of the benefit period.

The other general method for defining disability is in terms of loss of a certain percentage of the insured's earned income due to accident or sickness. It may be used as the sole definition of disability, or an occupational approach may be used for a policy's basic disability benefit, and then a lossof-income approach employed for the policy's residual disability benefit.

#### **Social Security Disability Benefits**

**Benefits Provided** There are two basic kinds of Social Security disability benefits: cash disability income benefits and freezing of a disabled worker's wage position for purposes of determining his or her future retirement or survivorship benefits.

An eligible worker is considered disabled when he or she has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is so severe the worker is unable to engage in any substantially gainful work or employment. This amounts to an "any occupation" definition of disability and is strict by health insurance standards. In addition, the disability must last five months before benefits can begin. After five months of disability, benefits are payable if the impairment can be expected to last for at least 12 months, or to result in death, or if it has actually lasted 12 months. This amounts to a five-month waiting (elimination) period.

The amount of monthly Social Security cash disability benefits payable to a disabled worker and his or her dependents is based on the worker's covered wages.

#### **Workers' Compensation Disability Benefits**

These laws are intended to provide benefits only for work injuries and diseases, and so they really cannot be relied upon in health insurance planning.

#### **Employer-Provided Group Disability Income Benefits**

Group coverages as part of employee benefit plans may provide two basic kinds of disability benefits: short-term benefits and long-term benefits.

**Benefits Provided** *Short-term plans* are characterized by a schedule of weekly benefits based on earnings categories but with relatively low maximum benefits; short elimination periods; and short maximum benefit periods of, for example, 13, 26, or 52 weeks.

*Long-term plans* (commonly called *LTD coverage*) are designed to take care of more serious, long-term disabilities. They are characterized by benefits stated as a percentage of earnings (such as 60 percent of base salary); a relatively high maximum monthly benefit of \$3,000, \$5,000, or more; a longer elimination period, such as 90 days or 5 months; a split definition of disability; and longer maximum benefit periods, such as 5 years, 10 years, or to a certain age, such as 65 or 70.

**Coordination of Benefits** Most group LTD plans have *coordination-ofbenefits* provisions that indicate how other disability income benefits will affect the benefits payable under the group plan. Such provisions are important in planning disability protection. They are not uniform, but they generally reduce group LTD benefits by Social Security benefits, state disability benefits, or benefits or salary otherwise provided by the employer. The important point for planning is that group plans normally do not reduce their benefits because of individual disability income insurance that is not provided by the employer.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume Harry Smart is covered by his employer's noncontributory group LTD plan providing a benefit of 60 percent of salary, up to \$5,000 per month, after a five-month elimination period, up to age 65. Tragically, Harry becomes ill and is totally disabled under the plan's definition of disability. Harry's base salary is \$125,000 per year, or about \$10,416 per month. Sixty percent of \$10,416 is \$6,250 per month, which is more than the plan's maximum monthly benefit. Therefore, after the five-month elimination period, Harry potentially could recover up to \$5,000 per month from the group plan. However, under the plan's coordination-of-benefits provision. Harry's family Social Security disability benefit of \$2,800 per month would be deducted from the benefit otherwise payable by the group plan. Therefore, the group plan benefit would become \$2,200 per month (\$5,000 – \$2,800). Note that if Harry had purchased a personally owned disability income policy to supplement his group benefits, its benefits would not reduce his group benefit.

**Termination of Coverage** A covered employee's group disability income coverage typically terminates when the employee leaves his or her employment, the employee retires, the group policy is terminated by the employer, or the employer fails to pay the premium for the employee. Also, contrary to the case with group life insurance, a terminating employee often does not have the right to convert the group coverage to an individual disability income policy.

**Taxation of Benefits** The tax code provides that amounts received through accident or health insurance for personal injuries or sickness are not considered gross income for federal income tax purposes, *except* for amounts received as an employee to the extent such amounts are attributable to employer contributions that were not includible in the employee's gross income. Thus, disability benefits from personally purchased disability income insurance are not gross income, nor are benefits received as an employee from an employment-related plan to the extent the employee contributed to the cost of the benefits. However, to the extent that disability income benefits for an employee are attributable to employer contributions that are not includible in the employee's gross income (as normally would be the situation for employer-provided disability income benefits), they constitute gross income to the disabled employee. Thus, in the case of Harry Smart, the group LTD benefits would be gross income to Harry, since his employer paid the full cost of the plan. However, if Harry had paid for an individual disability income policy, its benefits would not be taxable.

#### **Individual Disability Income Insurance**

**Need for Coverage** There are several reasons why people might need individual coverage despite the growth of group benefits. They may not be members of groups that provide such coverage, or they may not yet be eligible to participate in a group plan. Group benefits may be inadequate, either in amount or in duration. Some people may not want to rely entirely on their employer's group benefits. Finally, individual policies may be used where business health insurance is needed.

**Benefits Provided** Individual policies provide monthly benefits for a specified period (maximum benefit period) during the continuance of the insured's total (and sometimes partial) disability. Individual disability income insurance should be analyzed mainly in terms of the perils covered, maximum benefit period, definition of disability, elimination period, and amount of coverage. Any individual health insurance should also be analyzed in terms of its renewal or continuance provision. Naturally, cost also is an important consideration. Premiums can vary among insurers.

Individual policies may cover disability either resulting from accidental bodily injury or resulting from accidental bodily injury or from sickness. As we said before, it is important to protect against both accident and sickness, as opposed to accident only.

Today, there is a wide choice of maximum benefit periods, ranging from as short as six months to as long as the insured's reaching age 65 or 70, or for the insured's lifetime. The period selected should depend on the person's needs. However, assuming that permanent protection is needed, consider buying or recommending coverage with longer maximum benefit periods, such as to age 65 or 70, or for life, for both accident and sickness. To buy shorter benefit periods (usually to reduce the cost) may result in benefits running out before the person reaches retirement age (when, presumably, his or her retirement benefits will start).

When insurers use a split definition of disability, in general, the longer the "own occupation" period, the better for the consumer. Of course, an "own occupation" definition for the entire maximum benefit period is better yet for the consumer.

There is a wide choice of elimination periods. They may range, for example, from none for accident and seven days for sickness up to one year or more for accident and sickness. Several factors may be considered when choosing an appropriate elimination period.

- N *Coordination with other disability coverage.* Other disability benefits may be available during an initial period of a disability, such as an employer's noninsured salary-continuation (sick-pay) plan.
- N *Other resources.* For example, an emergency fund could be maintained to take care of short periods of disability, among other purposes.
- N *Cost savings.* A relatively small increase in the elimination period will normally produce considerable savings in premium.

**Amount of Coverage** Within limits, applicants can choose the amount of coverage for which they want to apply. This, of course, depends on the amount of benefits they need, want, and can afford. It also may depend on the amount of insurance insurers are willing to write on a given individual.

When underwriting individual disability income insurance, insurers have issue and participation limits. An *issue limit* is the maximum amount of monthly benefit an insurer will write on any one individual. A *participation limit* is the maximum amount of monthly benefits from all sources in which an insurer will participate (i.e., write a portion of the coverage). In addition to try to avoid overinsurance—insurers limit the amount of disability income insurance they will issue to a person so that monthly benefits from all sources will not exceed a specified percentage of the person's earned income.

These underwriting rules may limit the amount of coverage available to a consumer. However, since they vary among insurers, consumers or their advisers may be able to get the amount of coverage they want by shopping around a little.

**Supplementary Benefits** Some of the more important benefits include the following:

- N *Waiver of Premium.* This provision is included automatically in most individual policies and is comparable to the similar benefit in life insurance.
- N *Residual Disability (Partial Disability) Benefit.* This benefit may be an integral part of the disability contract, but is often written as an optional rider for an extra premium. The residual disability benefit normally pays a proportionate part of the total disability benefit when the insured suffers at least a specified percentage reduction in his or her earned income (such

as at least a 20 percent reduction). Loss of income often is the coverage trigger for this benefit. Many policies will pay this benefit only after a period of total disability.

- N *Guaranteed Insurability.* This commonly provides that on stated policy anniversary dates, the insured may purchase specified additional amounts of disability income benefits with no evidence of insurability.
- N *Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA).* This benefit provides specified costof living increases in disability benefits after a total disability has lasted a certain period, such as one year. COLA coverage that applies to disability income benefit limits prior to a disability also may be purchased.
- N *Social Security Supplement Coverage.* This provides additional benefits when the insured is disabled and receives no Social Security benefits. This may be helpful because the Social Security definition of disability generally is considerably stricter than the definition in most individual policies, and so benefits may be payable under an individual policy but not by Social Security.
- N *Accidental Death or Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) Coverage.* This is similar to double indemnity in life insurance. And, as with life insurance, the logic of buying this kind of coverage is highly questionable.
- N *Accident Medical Reimbursement, Hospital Income, or Other Medical Expense Benefits.* These types of benefits usually can be added to disability income policies.
- N *Benefits That Increase the Amount of the Basic Disability Income Coverage.*  One such benefit is a *family income-type benefit* that provides for a decreasing amount of disability income insurance. Another is a variable benefit that allows the amount of monthly income to vary during an initial period of disability to coordinate with other disability benefits.

**Coordination of Benefits** In general, individual disability income policies pay their benefits, regardless of other disability benefits. However, insurers may place certain provisions relating to other insurance in their contracts, but they usually do not do so today. Also, most individual policies are written on a "24-hour basis." This means they pay for both occupational and nonoccupational disabilities.

**Termination of Coverage** As explained later, policies that are noncancelable or guaranteed renewable typically provide that coverage will continue, provided the insured continues to pay the premiums, until a specified age, such as age 65. Some policies allow the insured to continue coverage beyond age 65 on a guaranteed renewable basis, on a conditionally renewable basis, or at the option of the insurer, usually provided the insured continues to be gainfully employed. Policies may have a terminal age, such as 70 or older, beyond which the coverage cannot be continued in any event.

**Taxation of Benefits** As noted earlier, benefits paid from personally purchased disability income insurance are not gross income for federal income tax purposes.

## **Other Disability Benefits**

**Group Life Insurance Disability Benefits** Several types of disability provisions may be used in group term life insurance plans. However, the most common is a *waiver-of-premium type* that provides for the continuation of a disabled employee's group term life coverage after termination of employment during continuation of disability.

**Disability Benefits Under Pension Plans** Pension plans may contain some disability benefits, such as the following:

- N A number of plans allow an employee who has become totally and permanently disabled to take early retirement under certain conditions.
- N Some pension plans provide a separate disability benefit for a totally and permanently disabled employee who has met specified requirements.
- N Many plans allow full vesting of an employee's pension benefits in the event of total and permanent disability.
- N Some plans provide a disability benefit akin to waiver of premium or the disability freeze in the Social Security system. This benefit allows a disabled employee's pension credits to continue to accumulate during his or her disability.

# **Medical Expense Coverages**

#### **Managed Care versus Fee-for-Service (Indemnity) Benefits**

A basic choice for many people today is whether they will have their medical expense coverage under a traditional fee-for-service (FFS; also called an *indemnity*) type plan or under a managed care type plan. They also may have several choices within each category.

**Fee-for-Service (Indemnity) Plans** These are primarily reimbursement mechanisms that pay for covered health care within the limits of the plan. They allow covered persons to decide when, from whom, and how much health care to use, and then they usually pay the "reasonable and customary" (or some similar term) fees or charges for that care, subject to the limits of the plan. They do not attempt to control access to care or utilization of care. Today, most fee-for-service plans are major medical plans, but some plans are more limited.

**Managed Care Plans** This term can embrace a number of health-care arrangements. However, the basic idea is that the plan not only finances health care, but also organizes the care and, to some degree, controls access to care. Thus, providers of care (doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, and so forth) have contracted with or are employed by the managed care plan and are, in varying degrees, controlled by the plan.

**Types of Managed Care Plans** There is considerable diversity among managed care plans, but the main types are as follows.

*Traditional Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs):* These are the original managed care plans. A covered person selects a primary care physician from among those participating in the HMO. This physician then manages the person's medical care and may refer the person to specialists, hospital care, and other medical services, again generally from among those participating in the HMO.

There are several types of HMOs, but they generally have the following characteristics:

- N Comprehensive benefits, including emphasis on preventive care, such as routine physical examinations, well-baby care, and inoculations
- N Little or no cost sharing (deductibles and coinsurance) by covered persons
- N Few or no claim forms to fill out
- N Generally only paying for services rendered in-network
- N Providing care in limited geographic areas
- N Often being low-cost plans for the coverage provided

*Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs):* PPOs contract with certain providers to form a network. The providers agree to render health care to persons covered by the PPO (such as employees) and to be paid according to a negotiated fee schedule, which is usually discounted from their regular fees. Covered persons may elect to secure medical care from providers within the PPO (in-network) or outside the PPO (out-of-network) under an indemnity plan. But when they use the indemnity plan, they are penalized financially by greater cost sharing or perhaps lower benefits.

*Point-of-Service (POS) Plans:* These can be viewed as a combination of the traditional HMO and a traditional fee-for-service plan. Covered persons select a primary care physician, who manages the person's medical care and who may refer the person to network specialists and other in-network forms of care. However, at the time medical services are to be rendered (i.e., at the point of service), the covered person may choose to receive care in-network (with little or no cost sharing and perhaps broader benefits) or to go out of network under the indemnity plan but with significantly higher cost sharing, perhaps lesser benefits, and the necessity of claim forms.

**Availability of Consumer Choice** Many consumers can choose from among one or more managed care plans and one or more indemnity plans. Employee benefit plans often allow employees to choose from among one or more HMOs, a PPO, and one or more indemnity plans. There may be different levels of employee contributions, depending on which plan is chosen.

Consumers also may purchase HMO or indemnity coverage on an individual basis. Furthermore, persons on Medicare (which generally has been a fee-for-service program) may be able to choose coverage under the Medicare + Choice program (described later in this chapter).

**Decision Factors in Making the Choice** The choice between fee-for-service and managed care may not be easy for many people. Following are some factors consumers may consider in making this choice:

- N Extent of benefits provided (including for preventive care)
- N Cost sharing required
- N Extent of controls over access to care
- N Size and reputation of managed care networks
- N Whether the consumer's present physicians are already in the managed care network
- N Relative desire for uncontrolled access to care
- N Cost of plans
- N Geographic limits of plans
- N Flexibility allowed in plans (e.g., availability of POS approach)

#### **Kinds of Medical Expense Benefits**

Although there are many kinds of medical expense benefits, the following are the most common. These may be provided under fee-for-service or managed care plans.

- N Hospital expense benefits
- N Surgical benefits
- N Regular medical (doctors' expense) benefits
- N Laboratory and diagnostic expense benefits
- N Prescription drug benefits
- N Dental plans
- N Preventive services
- N Other basic benefits

## **Major Medical Plans**

Major medical and comprehensive medical coverages represent the backbone of protection against medical expenses on a fee-for-service basis today.

**Covered Expenses** These plans cover most kinds of medical expenses, whether or not the covered person is confined in a hospital. They specify that only reasonable and customary (R&C) or usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) charges will be paid. Thus, on this basis, insurers may reduce covered charges that they feel do not fall within the prevailing pattern of charges in a community.

**Maximum Limit** Plans usually contain an overall maximum limit of liability that may range from as low as \$10,000 to \$1,000,000 or more. Some plans have no maximum limit at all. Maximum limits can usually be reinstated after a specified amount of benefits, such as \$1,000, have been paid and the covered person submits evidence of insurability or returns to work for a specified period. Some policies, however, provide for automatic restoration of the maximum.

**Deductibles** Major medical deductibles are applied to the first \$200, \$300, \$500, or more of covered medical expenses before benefits are paid.

**Coinsurance** After the deductible is satisfied, major medical policies normally require the covered person to bear a certain portion, commonly 20 or 25 percent, of covered expenses, with the insurer paying the remainder. This is referred to as a *coinsurance provision.* However, most plans today have *stoploss provisions,* which limit the unreimbursed, covered expenses for a person to a maximum amount, such as \$1,500 per year. After this unreimbursed stop-loss limit is reached in a year, the plan pays 100 percent of covered expenses up to a maximum limit.

**Excess Major Medical** Some insurance companies write excess major medical coverage on an association group basis or as an individual policy. Excess major medical applies after other medical expense coverage has paid its limits or a large deductible has been satisfied by the insured.

## **Medicare**

Persons age 65 and over who are not currently employed may rely primarily on Medicare for their medical expense protection, although they may also have retiree health coverage from their former employer, use individual plans to supplement Medicare, or be covered by so-called Medicare HMOs. Private plans are generally coordinated with Medicare so their benefits will not overlap.1 The original Medicare program comprised two major plans: Part A–Hospital Insurance (HI) and Part B Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI). These original plans are on a free-for-service basis and are described in the next sections.

Subsequent legislation has increased the options available to covered persons through a new Medicare Part C (called Medicare + Choice) and a later Medicare Part D (a Medicare prescription drug coverage). These plans also are described later in this chapter.

**Hospital Insurance (HI)** Nearly everyone age 65 or over is eligible for HI, which provides the following main benefits (as of 2009):

- N HI covers up to 90 days of inpatient care in any participating hospital for each benefit period. For the first 60 days, HI pays for all covered services except for a \$1,068 deductible. For the 61st through the 90th days, it pays for all covered services except for a deductible of \$267 per day.
- N There is an additional lifetime reserve of 60 hospital days. For each of these days used, HI pays for all covered services except for a \$534-per-day deductible.
- N After hospital confinement, HI covers up to 100 days of care in a participating extended-care facility (nursing home). It pays for all covered services for the first 20 days and all but a \$133.50-per-day deductible for up to 80 additional days.2
- N HI covers unlimited home health visits by a participating home health agency (e.g., a participating visiting nurse service) on a part-time, intermittent basis.
- N HI also covers certain hospice care services.

**Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI)** This portion of Medicare is voluntary, although persons eligible for HI are covered automatically unless they decline SMI coverage. SMI is financed by individuals age 65 and over who participate and by contributions from the federal government. It generally pays 80 percent of the reasonable charges for covered medical services

<sup>1</sup>Under federal law, for active workers and their spouses over age 65, their employer's health plan is primary over Medicare. For retired workers and their spouses, Medicare can be made primary, and usually is so, by any employer's health plan.

<sup>2</sup>All of these deductibles or cost-sharing provisions are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in hospital costs. Some of what we have called deductions (because that is their effect) are technically called *coinsurance* by Social Security.

after a \$135 deductible in each calendar year. The following are some of the major services covered by SMI:

- N Physicians' and surgeons' services and supplies
- N Home health services on an unlimited basis
- N Other medical and health services, such as diagnostic tests
- N Outpatient physical and occupational therapy services
- N All outpatient services of participating hospitals

**Expenses Not Covered by Medicare (Medicare Gaps)** These noncovered expenses give rise to the planning issue of whether and how Medicare should be supplemented to cover these gaps. Following are some of the main gaps in Medicare coverage:

- N Custodial care intended primarily to meet the daily living needs of persons who can no longer be self-sufficient
- N Cost-sharing provisions under HI and SMI (e.g., deductibles and coinsurance)
- N Periods of hospitalization and skilled nursing home services beyond the HI limits on numbers of days
- N Routine physical examinations and immunizations
- N Eyeglasses and regular eye examinations
- N Hearing aids and regular audiological examinations
- N Cosmetic surgery (except where immediately required due to accidental injury)
- N Routine foot care and orthopedic shoes
- N Ordinary dentures and dental work
- N Doctors' charges and other charges above what Medicare will pay as reasonable charges
- N Private-duty nursing in a hospital or skilled nursing facility
- N Private room in a hospital or skilled nursing facility (unless medically necessary)
- N Medical care outside the United States

**Medicare Supplements** People may seek to supplement Medicare with individual or association group policies.3 The policies sold by insurance companies to supplement Medicare—called *Medicare supplement policies* or

3An employer may provide continuing medical expense coverage for its retired, former employees and often their spouses (retiree health coverage). When the retired, former employees and their spouses (if covered) are age 65 or over and hence are covered by Medicare, this retiree health coverage is secondary to Medicare and thus supplements Medicare. Whether a retired, former employee and his or her spouse with reasonable retiree health coverage needs to supplement Medicare further with individual coverage is questionable, depending, as always, on the circumstances.

*Medigap policies*—essentially are standardized. There now are 10 approved Medigap policies that can be sold to the public. In effect, if insurers are in the Medicare supplement market, these are the plans (with some exceptions) they can offer.

All these standard plans contain a basic core of benefits, which include the 20 percent SMI coinsurance, the HI daily copayment for the 61st through the 90th days of hospitalization, coverage for 365 additional days of hospitalization beyond the 90 days provided by HI, and coverage of the patient's charges for the first three pints of blood each year. One standard plan provides only these core benefits. The other nine plans provide these core benefits and one or more additional optional benefits.

In addition to the standard policy requirements just described, persons enrolling in Medicare Part B (SMI) after November 1, 1991, are given a sixmonth open enrollment period during which insurers may not deny the person a Medigap policy nor discriminate against them in pricing such coverage due to the person's health status, claims experience, or medical condition. This open-window enrollment period can provide protection for Medicare enrollees who are in poor health and desire Medigap coverage.

**Medicare HMOs** Some HMOs have contractual arrangements with Medicare (the Health Care Financing Agency) under which eligible HMO subscribers receive their Medicare benefits through the HMO and the HMO also may provide additional services that supplement Medicare.

**Medicare Premiums Charged to Covered Persons** Social Security beneficiaries do not pay any additional premium for Part A (HI). They do, however, pay a monthly premium for Part B (SMI), which has increased dramatically over the years. Also, the Part B premium now increases with the person's or married couple's income for tax purposes. Nevertheless, eligible persons generally should enroll in Part B because the coverage is well worth the cost.

The relatively few persons who are age 65 and over but who are not otherwise eligible for Medicare can enroll voluntarily in Part A (HI) and Part B (SMI) and pay a rather substantial monthly cost for both, or enroll only in Part B and pay a lesser monthly cost.

**Medicare + Choice** The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created Medicare Part C (Medicare + Choice), effective January 1, 1999. Under this program, each year, Medicare beneficiaries have the opportunity to choose the Medicare plan in which they wish to participate. First, Medicare beneficiaries who are already enrolled in the original Medicare plan (HI and SMI), the original plan with supplemental insurance, or a Medicare HMO may remain with their plan if they wish. However, Medicare beneficiaries who are entitled to Part A and enrolled in Part B and those newly eligible for Parts A and B may choose to enroll in the Medicare + Choice option under Part C, rather than in Parts A and B.

There are two options under Medicare + Choice. One is termed coordinated care plans (or Medicare-managed care plans) and is a managed-care option. The plans available under this option include traditional HMOs; provider-sponsored organizations (PSOs), which are like HMOs but are organized by health-care providers; HMOs with point-of-service options; and PPOs. These plans may provide additional benefits, but some may also charge an additional premium.

A second option is a private fee-for-service (PFFS) plan*.* Under this option, beneficiaries can choose their own providers of care, but providers may charge beneficiaries more than the amount allowed for their services by the plan, up to a limit. In this case, the beneficiary must pay the difference to the provider. This is referred to as *balance billing.* Balance billing is not permitted under the original Medicare plan if the provider accepts assignment of Medicare benefits. Even if a provider does not accept assignment, there still generally is a limit on the amount doctors and other providers can charge over the Medicare-approved amount (called the limiting charge). If the PFFS option is chosen, Medicare pays the PFFS plan a premium and the PFFS plan provides all Medicare benefits and perhaps additional benefits to the beneficiary. The beneficiary may have to pay an additional premium.

**Planning Issues Under Medicare + Choice** Some of the factors involved in making selections between the original Medicare plan and Medicare + Choice (and, if Medicare + Choice, which option to choose) include:

- N Control over access to care (choice of providers)
- N Services covered and availability of extra benefits, such as outpatient prescription drugs, vision care, hearing aids, and routine physical exams
- N Cost sharing by beneficiaries
- N Ability of providers to bill beneficiaries for more than plan benefits (balance billing)
- N Additional premium for beneficiaries
- N Geographic limitations on coverage

**Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage** This is Part D of Medicare and offers prescription drug coverage for everyone with other Medicare coverage. Eligible persons can enroll in Medicare prescription drug programs provided by many insurance companies and others. They can also get drug coverage through Medicare Advantage Plans that offer such coverage.

Persons can enroll in Medicare prescription drug programs when they first become eligible for Medicare or, if later, between November 15 and December 31 of each year. However, persons who do not enroll when first eligible will have to pay a late enrollment penalty which will increase their monthly fee from then on. There are some exceptions to this late enrollment fee. The monthly fee and drugs covered depend on the particular plan that covered persons select.

For each year, there is a deductible that must be met before the plan will begin to pay for covered drugs. This deductible is \$295. Then there is a copayment or coinsurance that the covered person must pay for covered drugs with the plan paying the balance. The coverage continues until the total amount paid for drugs by both the plan and covered person equals \$2,700. Then the covered person must pay all the cost of covered drugs until he or she has spent \$4,350. This is the coverage gap (or "doughnut"). After this \$4,350 has been spent, almost all the remaining costs for the year are covered under what is called the catastrophic coverage.

#### **Workers' Compensation**

Workers' compensation laws provide unlimited medical benefits to employees injured on the job. Other plans normally exclude expenses for which a covered person is entitled to workers' compensation benefits.

#### **Employer-Provided Medical Expense Benefits (Group Benefits)**

The lion's share of private medical expense benefits in the United States is provided under group coverages established by employers for their employees. Therefore, the beginning point in medical expense coverage planning is to determine what, if any, group protection applies.

**Who Is Covered?** Group plans cover employees and their dependents. The definition of *dependents* is important and perhaps will indicate some dependents for whom other arrangements may need to be made.

Plans may allow employees to waive coverage for certain dependents (such as spouses working outside the home), provided they have other coverage. They also may offer employees financial incentives to do so. This may be something for employees to consider (when applicable) as a cost-saving measure.

**Benefits Provided** Group plans can provide any of the benefits previously described. The group technique generally makes possible the provision of broader benefits at lower cost than can be provided under individual policies.

**Coordination of Benefits** Most group plans include a coordination-ofbenefits (COB) provision, which has the effect of setting a priority of payment among plans and limiting the total amount recoverable from group plans (and certain other coverages) in effect for a person to 100 percent (or some other percentage, such as 80 percent) of the expenses covered under any of the plans. This serves to avoid duplication of benefits when a person is covered under more than one group plan. In most cases, however, group plans do not coordinate with individual policies.

**Termination of Coverage** An employee's group coverage may terminate when the employee terminates his or her employment. Dependents' coverage may terminate when the employee's coverage terminates or when their dependency status changes.

**COBRA Continuation Rights** The*Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985* (popularly called *COBRA*) requires most employers to provide continued coverage under group health plans to covered employees and other qualified beneficiaries (spouse and dependent children) in case of certain qualifying events, such as termination of employment or reduction of hours, death of the employee, divorce or legal separation, and a child's reaching the maximum age for coverage, without the qualified beneficiary's needing to show any evidence of insurability.

The continued coverage is the same as under the group health plan and must be available for 18 or 36 months, depending on the nature of the qualifying event. The qualified person must elect this continuation, and a premium may be charged to the qualified person for it up to 102 percent of the cost of the coverage to the plan.4 Such continuation generally is not available when there is coverage under another group plan or Medicare. When a qualified beneficiary's continuation coverage expires, the beneficiary must be given the option of enrolling in the conversion health plan that otherwise is available under the group plan.

**Health Insurance Portability** Another federal measure broadening the rights of employees and their dependents under group health plans is the *Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996* (HIPAA). For most group health plans, this law regulates the terms of any preexistingconditions exclusion and requires group plans to give credit for prior coverage under a wide variety of other health plans in meeting the requirements of any preexisting-conditions exclusion.

4Under the American Recovery and Reinvesment Act of 2009 (the federal stimulus program), a temporary 65 percent reduction in this premium is granted to eligible individuals who are involuntarily terminated. An eligible individual is a qualified beneficiary who became eligible for COBRA from September 1, 2008, through December 31, 2009, and is not a high-income person. Employees are given a refundable tax credit for their premium reductions. Thus, the federal government really pays the tax for them.

#### **Health and Disability Income Insurance 537**

Suppose, for example, that Maria Hernandez has been covered for five years as an employee under the group health plan of the ABC Corporation and that her 12-year-old son is covered as a dependent. Unfortunately, her son has a congenital heart condition that is treated regularly. Maria has just received an attractive job offer from XYZ Corporation. XYZ also has a group health plan, but it has a 12-month preexisting-conditions exclusion. Maria is worried that if she changes jobs, her son will lose health coverage for 12 months under her new employer's plan. She need not worry! HIPAA requires XYZ's plan to count her prior coverage under ABC's plan toward its 12-month exclusion period, and so, in her case, there will be no preexistingconditions exclusion applying to her son under XYZ's plan.

HIPAA also does not permit group health plans to discriminate as to eligibility or premiums for coverage based solely on health status, medical condition, claims experience, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability, and certain other factors. Thus, XYZ's plan could not impose stricter eligibility requirements or higher premiums on Maria's son because of his health impairment.

**Retiree Health Coverage** Employers may continue medical expense coverage for their retirees and often the retirees' dependents. When these benefits are provided, there normally are some age and/or service requirements to qualify. Thus, one factor employees should consider in deciding on their retirement age (or whether to accept an early retirement offer) is how it will affect their eligibility for retiree benefits.

Once retired, former employees and their spouses age 65 and over are eligible for Medicare. Retiree health coverage is coordinated with Medicare so there is no duplicate coverage, with Medicare being the primary coverage. In effect, these plans supplement Medicare.

One point for retirees and employees to consider is whether an employer that now has retiree health coverage may in the future attempt to modify or terminate those benefits. Employers normally reserve the right to modify or terminate retiree health coverage (as well as other employee benefits, for that matter) in the future. However, many employers, particularly larger employers, have maintained retiree health coverage for many years.

**Strategies in Planning for Terminated Coverage** There are several possibilities for a person whose group coverage has terminated.

- N The person may be eligible immediately for other group insurance.
- N The person may be eligible for Medicare upon reaching age 65. In this case, the person (and possibly his or her spouse) may also be fortunate enough to have retiree health coverage.

#### **538 Part VII. Insurance Planning and Risk Management**

- N The person may elect continuation of group coverage under COBRA. In this case, he or she also will have conversion rights at the end of the COBRA period.
- N The person (and covered dependents) may have the right to convert the terminating group insurance to an individual policy without evidence of insurability. As just noted, conversion rights must also be made available at the end of a COBRA continuation period (through election during the preceding 180 days).
- N The person may purchase new individual insurance to replace terminated group coverage. HIPAA requires insurers to offer such coverage without individual evidence of insurability under certain conditions.

**Employer-Provided Cafeteria Compensation or Flexible Benefits Programs** A number of employers have organized their employee benefit plans so that employees can choose at least part of their benefit package from among several types and levels of benefits. This is referred to as *cafeteria compensation* or *flexible benefits.*<sup>5</sup>

Employees frequently are given a set number of dollar credits, which they can spend on a menu of benefit choices. These choices may include one or more medical expense plans, group term life insurance, dependent group life insurance, and disability income benefits. If an employee spends more than his or her allotted credits, his or her salary is reduced *before tax* to pay for the extra cost. On the other hand, if the employee spends less, his or her salary may be increased by the difference or it may be placed in certain retirement plans. When employees are offered a wide choice of benefits, such as just described, it is sometimes referred to as *full flex.* Employers also may offer flexible benefits plans that are more limited.

Another more limited kind of flexible benefits program is the health-care *flexible spending account* (FSA). An employee may elect to have his or her salary reduced by a certain amount (up to a limit specified in the plan), and this amount then is placed *before tax* in a separate account from which medical expenses that are not otherwise covered by the employer's plan can be paid. However, employees should take care not to place more in an FSA than will be covered by it in a given year. If the amount in an FSA at the end of a year exceeds the benefits paid from it during the year, the employee will forfeit the balance. This is referred to as the "use it or lose it" rule. The attraction of FSAs is that otherwise-noncovered medical expenses can be paid on a

<sup>5</sup> Since these plans are permitted by Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code, they also are called Section 125 plans.

before-tax basis. There also may be FSAs for dependent care expenses. FSAs may be part of a full-flex program or may stand alone.

## **Individual Health Insurance**

A great many different individual and family medical expense policies are available to the public from many different insurers. These policies may offer consumers broad coverage, but some provide only limited coverage. Therefore, such policies should be evaluated carefully.

**Who Is Covered?** Individual medical expense insurance can be written to cover the insured person, the insured's spouse, and other dependents.

**Benefits Provided** The same kinds of medical expense benefits can be provided under individual policies as under group coverages, except that individual policies often offer less liberal benefits.

**Coordination of Benefits** Since people are free to buy individual medical expense policies from a number of insurers, may have group coverage, and also may be covered by other medical expense benefits, they may find themselves with several sources of recovery for medical expenses. This is not necessarily bad, but it is an area that can be analyzed to see if premium dollars can be saved by dropping any unnecessary coverage. Individual policies usually do not contain provisions that would coordinate or prorate their benefits with other coverage. Insurers generally try to avoid overinsurance by their underwriting requirements.

**Termination of Coverage** Individual policies may terminate the insured's or spouse's coverage when he or she reaches age 65 or first becomes eligible for Medicare. Of course, Medicare supplement policies are not terminated.

# **Individual Health Insurance Policy Provisions**

Several kinds of policy provisions may be important in making policy purchase decisions.

## **Renewal or Continuance Provisions**

*Renewal or continuance provisions* relate to the insured's rights to continue his or her individual coverage from one policy period to another. They generally can be classified as given here. Policies have been issued that were renewable at the option of the insurer (or optionally renewable). This approach generally is not used today. Another approach that sometimes is used is that policies may be conditionally renewable (or nonrenewable for stated reasons only), in that there are restrictions on the insurer's right of nonrenewal. An example is in franchise or association group coverages, where the insurer may not be able to refuse renewal unless the insured ceases to be a member of the association, the insured ceases to be actively engaged in the occupation, or the insurer refuses to renew all policies issued to members of the particular group.

A common approach is for individual policies to be *guaranteed renewable*. In this case, the policy provides that the insured has the right to renew coverage for a specified period, such as to age 65, or in some cases for life. During this period, the insurer cannot by itself make any change in the policy, except that the insurer retains the right to make changes in premium rates for whole classes of policies. This means the insurer cannot change the premium or classification for an individual policy by itself, but may change the rates for whole rating classifications.

For policies issued after June 30, 1997, HIPAA requires most individual medical expense contracts to be guaranteed renewable at the option of the policyholder. It would seem desirable for policyholders to make this election, even if the cost is somewhat higher. Nonrenewal is allowed only in limited circumstances. Insurers also may write disability income coverages on a guaranteed renewable basis.

The final category is the *noncancelable and guaranteed renewable* (or noncancelable) type. When the term *noncancelable,* or *noncan,* is used alone to describe a renewal provision, it means the noncancelable and guaranteed renewable type. This provision gives the insured the right to continue the policy in force by the timely payment of premiums as specified in the policy, usually for a specified period, such as to age 65. The insurer retains no right by itself to make any change in any policy provision during this period. The distinction between this and a guaranteed renewable policy is that the insurer guarantees the premium rates for noncancelable contracts but reserves the right to change premiums for whole classes of insureds under guaranteed renewable contracts.

Not surprisingly, the greater the renewal guarantees contained in a policy, the higher the premium will tend to be. Thus, assuming the consumer has a choice among renewal provisions, the question becomes: How much is he or she willing to pay for renewal protection? In general, it probably is better to try to purchase noncancelable coverage if it is available; otherwise, he or she should purchase guaranteed renewable coverage.

#### **Preexisting Conditions**

Individual health insurance policies normally limit coverage for conditions existing prior to the effective date of coverage. Group health plans, on the other hand, may cover preexisting conditions on the same basis as other conditions or may use a preexisting-conditions exclusion that meets the requirements of HIPAA.

However, a section of the "time limit on certain defenses" provision, which is a required provision in individual health insurance policies, in effect provides that after a policy has been in force for two or three years, coverage cannot be denied by the insurer on the ground that a loss was caused by a preexisting condition, unless the condition is specifically excluded in the policy. Many states have further restricted the application of preexistingconditions exclusions.

#### **General Provisions**

**Time Limit on Certain Defenses** In addition to the part of this provision dealing with preexisting conditions, another aspect specifies that after a policy has been in force for two or three years, no misstatements, except fraudulent misstatements, made by the applicant in securing the policy can be used to void the policy or to deny liability for a loss commencing after the two- or three-year period. It is similar in concept to the incontestable clause used in life insurance.

**Grace Period** Like life insurance policies, individual health contracts allow a grace period for the payment of premiums.

**Notice and Proof Requirements** The policy indicates certain time limits for the insured to give written notice of a claim and furnish the insurer with completed proofs of loss.

## **Health Savings Accounts and Health Reimbursement Arrangements**

These are included in the general category of consumer driven health plans (CDHPs) that aim to give consumers the power to direct their health-care spending in an efficient manner for them. The concept is that it will encourage consumers to spend carefully and thus help control health-care costs. Consumers are provided with accounts (sums of money) to use for their healthcare spending. In essence, they are health-care defined-contribution plans.

One form of this approach is the *health flexible spending account* (FSA) that has already been discussed in this chapter.

Another development in this concept was the *Archer medical savings account* (MSA) that was launched in 1977 and tested again later. However, no new Archer MSAs may be established since December 31, 2003.

### **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)**

**General Considerations** The successor to the Archer MSA is the health savings account (HSA). HSAs were adopted starting in 2004 by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The concept behind the HSA is to enable persons, or employers on behalf of their employees, to set aside annual contributions in a tax-exempt trust or custodial account to pay for or reimburse qualifying medical expenses.

**Eligible Individuals** To be eligible for an HSA, an individual must be covered under a high deductible health plan, have no other health coverage (with some exceptions), not be enrolled in Medicare, and not be a dependent on another's tax return. For married persons, each eligible spouse must open his or her own HSA.

**High Deductible Health Plans** A required *high deductible health plan* (HDHP) has a high annual deductible and places limits on annual out-of-pocket expenses. For 2009, the annual deductible must be at least \$2,000 and not more than \$3,000 for self-only coverage and at least \$4,000 but not over \$6,050 for family coverage. Correspondingly, the annual out-of-pocket expenses (other than for premiums) for covered expenses cannot exceed \$4,000 for self-only coverage and \$7,350 for family coverage. These amounts are indexed for inflation.

**Permitted Contribution** Annual contributions now are limited by a statutory maximum (regardless of HDHP deductibles) which in 2009 is \$3,000 for self-only coverage and \$5,950 for family coverage. There also are catchup contributions for taxpayers age 55 or over of \$1,000 as of 2009. These limits also are indexed for inflations. Contributions can be made by the eligible individual, his or her employer on behalf of the individual, or family members for the individual. All contributions must be in cash.

**Tax Treatment of HSAs** The tax treatment of HSAs is quite favorable. Contributions (within certain limits) are deductible from the person's gross income, and if made by the individual's employer, are excluded from his or her gross income. Investment earnings on the assets in an HSA are not currently taxable income to the individual owner. Distributions from an HSA to pay qualified medical expenses for the individual, his or her spouse, or his or her dependents are excluded from the individual's gross income. Distributions for any other purpose are taxable. They are also subject to a 10 percent penalty, unless the individual is disabled, becomes eligible for Medicare, or is deceased.

**HSA Rollovers** At present, there can be one-time rollovers from a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA), considered next, and an FSA to the person's HSA. These rollovers do not count as contributions and so are not subject to the HSA contribution limits. These HRA and FSA rollover provisions are scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2011.

A one-time rollover also is permitted from an IRA owned by the individual. However, this rollover does count as a contribution and so is subject to the HSA contribution limits.

**Distributions** Income tax–free distributions can be made from an HSA for qualified medical expenses, which generally are those that would be deductible for federal income tax purposes. However, this generally does not include health insurance premiums, except in some cases such as premiums for COBRA continuation coverage and for qualified LTC insurance. Also, any health insurance premiums (other than for Medigap coverage) are qualified expenses once the person attains Medicare coverage. In effect then, these health premiums can be paid with before-tax dollars from the HSA. As noted earlier, other distributions are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10 percent penalty tax.

**At Death** If the deceased owner's spouse is the designated beneficiary, the spouse becomes the owner of the HSA and may treat it as his or her own HSA. On the other hand, if anyone else is the beneficiary, it will be paid to that person, but its value at death will be included in the beneficiary's gross income for federal income tax purposes.

Its value at death will be included in the deceased owner's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. But if the benefit is ordinary income (i.e., to a non-spouse beneficiary), it will also be IRD to that beneficiary.

**Planning Issues** Under the right circumstances, HSAs can be attractive health coverage and wealth accumulation vehicles. If the owner and his or her family are in reasonably good health and thus medical expenses are reasonable, the account value with its tax-deferred or tax-free investment earnings can grow substantially over time. When the person becomes eligible for Medicare, he or she can no longer contribute to the HSA, but the account balance will be available to pay non-Medicare-covered medical expenses on a before-tax basis. It can also be used to pay LTC premiums before-tax.

Of course, the HSA owner must pay for the required HDHP. However, this plan will be available to cover unexpected or catastrophic expenses over the deductible and an annual out-of-pocket limit.

However, if an employee has good employer-financial health coverage, he or she would not be eligible for an HSA.

#### **Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs)**

These are employer-paid plans that create an account or fund for employees to use to pay for qualified medical expenses. In essence, HRAs are defined contribution health plans. Neither the employer contributions to the HRA nor the distributions made to cover qualified medical expenses are taxable to the covered employees. Also, like other employee benefits, reasonable employer contributions are deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses by the employer.

Unlike FSAs (which involve elective employee deferrals), unused accounts in an employee's HRA at the end of a year are not lost to the employee (i.e., the use it or lose it FSA feature). Instead, such unused amounts can be carried forward in the HRA to future years and used for medical expenses even after the employee leaves the employer. The balances in these accounts may not be taken in cash. However, as noted earlier, HRAs may be rolled over one time before December 31, 2011, to a person's HSA.
