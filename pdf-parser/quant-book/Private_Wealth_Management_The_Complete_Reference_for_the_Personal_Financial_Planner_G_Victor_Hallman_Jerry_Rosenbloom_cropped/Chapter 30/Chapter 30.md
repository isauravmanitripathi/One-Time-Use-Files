This chapter deals with several methods (i.e., revocable living trusts and jointly owned property WROS) for transferring property to others at a person's death other than by the traditional will. These may be broadly referred to as *will substitutes.* However, elsewhere in the book we have discussed various kinds of property or property interests that can pass to others at the direction of the owner outside the probate estate. These also can be referred to as will substitutes. They include beneficiaries under qualified retirement plans and IRAs, life insurance beneficiary designations, noncharitable beneficiaries under charitable remainder trusts, other beneficiary designations (e.g., under nonqualified annuities, U.S. savings bonds, and some bank accounts), and transfer-on-death (TOD) arrangements for securities in states that permit them. These interests will not be discussed further here. Also covered in this chapter are various arrangements for managing property in the event of the owner's physical or mental incapacity.

# **Revocable Living Trusts as a Will Substitute**

A possibly advantageous way of managing property during an owner's lifetime and then transmitting it to others at death is the *revocable living trust.*  These are trusts that can be terminated or changed by the creator during his or her lifetime.

### **Basic Characteristics**

During their lifetime, estate owners create a revocable trust into which they may place some or the major part of their property. The trustee administers and invests the property and pays the income to the creator (grantor) or as the creator directs. Since creators can alter, amend, or revoke the trust at any point during their lifetime, they can change the trustee, change the beneficiaries, change other terms of the trust, or revoke the trust and get the property back. Upon the creator's death, the trust becomes irrevocable, and the corpus is administered according to its terms for the benefit of the creator's beneficiaries. In this sense, it acts like a will.

If desired, the trust can contain marital and nonmarital trust provisions to make proper use of the federal estate tax marital deduction. Life insurance on the estate owner's life and other death benefits can be made payable to the trust. Also, property normally can be poured over from an estate owner's will into such a trust. This is referred to as a *pour-over will.* Thus, a revocable trust can unify an estate so that it can be administered under one instrument. Property can be placed in a revocable living trust as soon as it is created, and assets can be added to it from time to time. Or, the trust can have minimal assets in it when created, and another party under a power of attorney can have authority to transfer the owner's assets into the trust in the event of the owner's physical or mental incapacity.

#### **Tax Status**

Since a revocable trust can be terminated by its creator at will, it is a grantor trust and trust income will be taxable to the creator during his or her lifetime. For transfer tax purposes, the corpus will be included in the grantor's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes since it is revocable by the grantor until his or her death. Furthermore, there is no taxable transfer for gift tax purposes when the trust is created because there is no completed gift. Thus, tax savings by the creator are not the motivation for setting up such trusts.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume that John Mature, age 55, owns securities and other income-producing property worth approximately \$4,000,000. This property yields about \$120,000 per year in investment income. John is a busy, successful business executive who also is active in church and civic affairs. He is married and has two married children and four grandchildren.

John decides to transfer the \$4,000,000 of income-producing property to a revocable living trust, with the XYZ Bank and Trust Company and John as cotrustees. The bank handles the investment of trust funds with John's consent. Trust income is paid to John during his lifetime. Following his death, the trust is to be continued for the benefit of John's wife, children, and grandchildren. The trust agreement contains marital and nonmarital trust provisions so that at John's death his estate can make proper use of the federal estate tax marital deduction. John's will pours over the balance of his probate estate into this trust.

John also owns \$1,000,000 of life insurance (including group term life insurance) on his life and has named the revocable living trust as beneficiary. (However, since his estate has grown in size, he is planning to absolutely assign his life insurance to an ILIT for the reasons given in the previous chapter.) The account balance under John's Section 401(k) plan is payable outright to his wife, Elena, as beneficiary, and their principal residence and a summer home are held by John and Elena as joint tenants with right of survivorship. It can be seen in this situation that relatively little (other than some assets John still owns in his own name) will be in John's probate estate and pass under the terms of his will.

#### **Goals of Revocable Living Trusts**

**Property Management** The XYZ Bank and Trust Company will manage and invest the trust property for John and pay him the income. Thus, John can be relieved of these duties and has the benefit of the bank's expertise in these areas. However, if for any reason John becomes dissatisfied with the arrangement, he can revoke the trust and recover his property or change trustees. Also, if he wishes, John can participate in investment management and, depending on state law, can even be the sole current trustee.

**Protection Against Incapacity** If John should become physically or mentally incapacitated or otherwise unable to manage his own affairs, the trust would become irrevocable and the successor trustee would continue to manage and invest trust property for John's benefit without interruption.

**Investment Diversification** If trust property is invested in, say, mutual funds under the prudent investor rule, the advantages of investment diversification can be secured.

**Acting as a Will Substitute** Upon John's death, the trust becomes irrevocable and the successor trustee will continue to manage and invest trust property for the surviving beneficiaries (John's family) and pay trust income to them without interruption. Ultimately, the property will be distributed to the trust beneficiaries according to the terms of the trust.

**Choice of Law** John also may decide in what state the trust is to be created and hence determine what law will govern the creation and operation of the trust.

**Avoidance of Ancillary Probate** If John owns real estate located in a state or states other than the state of his domicile, it can be placed in the revocable living trust, and ancillary administration in the state where the real estate is located (its situs) after John's death can be avoided.1

**Confidentiality** How, to whom, and what property passes at death under a revocable living trust is private information. It is not available to the public, although the other trust beneficiaries can know. A will, on the other hand, is a matter of public record, and anyone who wishes to can see its terms.

**Less Vulnerable to Contestation** Some feel it may be more difficult for disgruntled heirs to attack a revocable living trust than to contest a will.

**Possibly Lower Cost** A revocable trust may be a less costly way for John to transfer his estate. This factor is difficult to evaluate and depends on the circumstances. A professional trustee, like the XYZ Bank and Trust Company, will charge an annual trustee's fee, which in this case might be around \$26,000 per year for an individually managed trust (see the illustrative fee schedule in Chapter 25). However, because such trustee's fees may be income tax– deductible, the after-tax cost could be less. Also, the trustee is providing investment management and other services to John while he is alive. Thus, annual trustee's fees can be viewed as analogous to the investment management fees for other investment intermediaries (e.g., the expense ratio for mutual funds or fees for investment advisers). Furthermore, if John is the trustee or the trustee does not charge a fee, there would be no annual trustee's fee.

Executors' commissions and other fees of estate administration are usually based on a percentage of the probate estate. This may also be true for the

<sup>1</sup>When property is left under a will, the estate normally is administered under the law of the state where the decedent was domiciled (intended to make his or her home). However, real estate in the probate estate is administered under the law of the state where the real estate is located (its situs). Thus, if a decedent is domiciled in one state but has real estate in another, there must be two administrations, with the attendant costs and possible delays. The administration in the second (or more) state(s)—the situs state(s)—is called *ancillary administration.*

fees of the attorney for the estate. Thus, John's estate could save at least part of the fees that otherwise would have been levied on the \$4,000,000 had it passed as part of John's probate estate under his will. These probate costs (which are deductible for estate tax or income tax purposes) might run, say, 3 to 5 percent of the \$4,000,000 principal amount. Thus, revocable trusts can result in annual trustee's fees, but can save on probate costs at the creator's death. On the other hand, certain necessary functions at death must be performed and paid for whether a revocable trust or a will is used.

**Grantor Can Be Trustee** During his lifetime, if he wishes, John may name himself as trustee or one of the trustees of the revocable trust and then name a successor trustee in the event of his incapacity or death.

**Avoid Delays in Probate** A revocable trust continues uninterrupted after the grantor's death.

Wills are still the traditional way to transmit wealth at death. However, a revocable living trust can be an alternative. In some cases, part of the estate can go by will and part under a revocable living trust. However, in virtually all cases, a will still is necessary because grantors normally retain at least some assets in their own names. Use of revocable living trusts tends to vary considerably among different parts of the United States; however, their use relative to wills seems to be slowly growing.

# **Joint Property with Right of Survivorship**

The characteristics of jointly owned property with right of survivorship (WROS) were described in Chapter 25.

#### **Advantages of Jointly Owned Property**

Joint ownership is a convenient, and perhaps natural, way to hold property among family members, particularly husband and wife. At one joint owner's death, the property passes automatically to the other. Also, jointly owned property passes outside the probate estate of the first owner to die and, hence, avoids any costs and delays of probate. Holding property in joint names can avoid inheritance taxes in some states. Finally, jointly owned property may pass to the survivor free of the claims of creditors of the deceased joint owner, depending on state law.

#### **Problems of Jointly Owned Property**

An important problem that may arise is a larger-than-necessary federal estate tax because of overqualification of jointly owned property for the marital deduction. This was explained in Chapter 28. Also, when joint ownership is created and one of the joint owners contributes all or more than a proportionate share of the purchase price, a gift for gift tax purposes is made if the transfer is irrevocable.

There are no cut-and-dried rules on how much property should be held in joint names. In situations where the federal estate tax is not a factor, people generally can hold property jointly if they wish. Even where the estate tax is a factor, some joint ownership normally is acceptable. Married couples often hold the family residence and perhaps some bank accounts in joint names for convenience.

# **Property Management Arrangements to Deal with Physical or Mental Incapacity**

#### **Durable Powers of Attorney**

A *power of attorney* is a written instrument in which one person (called the *principal* ) names another person or persons as his or her attorney-in-fact or agent to act on the principal's behalf, as provided for in the instrument. In essence, it is an agency relationship. A *durable power of attorney* is one that continues in effect, or becomes effective, after the principal's incapacity. To be a durable power, the instrument must specifically so state, unless state law provides otherwise. Powers of attorney can also be *general* or *limited.* A general power of attorney authorizes the agent to act for the principal generally in all matters, while a limited power applies only to certain specified matters.

One approach to planning for incapacity is to execute an *immediately effective durable general power of attorney* naming one or more highly trusted persons as attorney-in-fact. The understanding among all involved should be that the power will not be used unless the person executing the power becomes incapacitated and unable to manage his or her affairs. Another approach is to execute a *springing durable general power of attorney.* A springing power becomes effective only in the event the principal becomes incapacitated, as defined in the document. However, in this case, a clear and workable definition of incapacity or disability is important.

#### **Durable Powers of Attorney in Conjunction with Revocable Living Trusts**

Still another approach is to have an existing (or springing) durable power of attorney under which the attorney-in-fact has the power to transfer some or all of the principal's assets to a previously existing revocable living trust. Thus, in the event of the principal's incapacity, the attorney-in-fact can use the power to fund or add assets to the revocable trust and have those assets administered for the principal. At the person's incapacity, the formerly revocable trust becomes irrevocable.

#### **Funded Revocable Living Trusts**

These trusts have been described previously. One of their main advantages is to provide property management in the event of the creator's incapacity and inability to manage his or her own affairs.

# **"Convenience" Joint Tenancies (Accounts)**

Sometimes, people attempt to deal with the issue of property management in case of incapacity by creating joint bank accounts, CDs, or other accounts with another person. Should one of them (presumably the older one) become incapacitated or die, the other joint owner would simply use the money or other assets to take care of the incapacitated joint owner or distribute the assets in the event of his or her death. This seems quite simple, and it may be in some cases. However, the essential problem with this approach is that assuming both owners can withdraw freely from the account, the funds may be used other than as intended. Thus, as a practical and legal matter, convenience joint accounts are a questionable solution to the incapacity problem in many cases.

### **Planning Issues with Regard to Incapacity**

This can be a complex and difficult financial planning problem. Professional help normally is advisable. A durable general power of attorney (either existing or springing) may be a satisfactory solution in many cases where there are relatively modest assets. On the other hand, when there are more extensive assets and perhaps other estate and family issues, a revocable living trust may be desirable. Frequently, both a revocable living trust (either unfunded or funded) and a durable power of attorney will be used.

An overriding issue in all of these arrangements is the selection of a person or persons (or institutional trustee) in which the property owner can have complete confidence to be attorney-in-fact or trustee of a living trust. This may be the truly difficult part. After all, this party may be handling the property owner's affairs when he or she is incapacitated. Of course, everyone hopes this will not happen, but it is a possibility to be aware of.

#### **Health-Care Decision Making**

The previous section dealt with the sensitive issue of how one can arrange for the management of his or her property in the event of physical or mental incapacity. Now we are dealing with the even more sensitive and controversial issue of health-care decision making when the individual is no longer able to make those decisions for himself or herself.

It is generally recognized that competent persons have the right to accept or refuse medical care for themselves. Unfortunately, however, persons may reach the point where they are no longer competent to make such decisions. Therefore, they may want to make advance arrangements for this unhappy contingency.

**Durable Powers of Attorney for Health-Care Decisions** This essentially is an extension of the durable power of attorney idea. It allows an attorney-infact to make health-care decisions for the principal, within the limits of any applicable law and any limits set by the principal in the power-of-attorney instrument, if the principal becomes incompetent to do so. This obviously can be an important power. The health-care power can be part of a power also covering property management or a separate power. Some states have enacted statutes that specifically allow persons to execute durable powers of attorney for health-care decisions. However, even in states without authorizing statutes, many authorities believe such powers still can be legally effective.

**Living Wills** Most states have statutes permitting persons to execute valid documents (*living wills*) that can direct in specified circumstances how medical treatment should be rendered or withheld in terminal situations after the person has become incompetent to make his or her own health-care decisions. While living wills and durable powers of attorney for health-care decisions have some similarities of purpose, they differ in several respects. First, living wills apply only in terminal situations. Second, not all kinds of care can be refused under the living-will statutes of various states. Third, durable powers permit the principal, in drafting the instrument, to set such terms and conditions on the power as the principal deems appropriate. Finally, a durable power allows the principal to name a specific party to make healthcare decisions if the principal is not competent to do so.
