Charitable giving has become an important part of financial and estate planning. Most charitable gifts are straightforward gifts of money. However, many times, appreciated property is given. On the other hand, a number of more sophisticated techniques may give the charitably inclined substantial tax and other benefits in addition to the satisfaction of knowing they have helped others.

## **Basic Tax Principles Income Tax Deduction**

Contributions to eligible charities can be taken as an itemized deduction (subject to certain annual limits explained next and the phase-out rules described in Chapter 10) for federal income tax purposes.

## **Annual Limits on Income Tax Deduction**

There are complicated rules that determine the amount of deduction that can be taken each year.1 This amount depends on the type of property given, the type of charity involved, the contribution base of the taxpayer, and ordering rules for applying the percentage limits. The rules are only briefly described here.

**Contribution Base** A taxpayer's *contribution base* is his or her AGI without allowance for any net operating loss carryback.

**Cash Contributions** For cash contributions to charities generally defined as *public charities* (e.g., churches, educational organizations, hospital and medical research organizations, governmental units, and publicly supported organizations),2 the annual limit is 50 percent of the contribution base. For cash contributions to other eligible charities, the limit is 30 percent of the contribution base (or what is left of the 50 percent limit if less).

**Long-Term Capital Gain Property** For gifts of *intangible personal property*  (e.g., stocks and bonds) or *real property* (real estate), which, if sold, would produce long-term capital gain, to public charities, the full fair market value of the property at the time of the gift can be deducted, but the annual limit is 30 percent of the contribution base (or what is left of the 50 percent limit if less).3 For gifts of long-term capital gain property to other eligible charities, the full fair market value can be deducted, but the annual limit is 20 percent of the contribution base (or what is left of the 30 percent limit if less).

<sup>1</sup>While there are annual limits on the deductibility of charitable contributions for federal income tax purposes, there are no such limits on federal gift tax and federal estate tax charitable deductions. For these taxes, gifts to any eligible charities are deductible in full.

<sup>2</sup>Certain private operating foundations and nonoperating "feeder foundations" also are included. These are organizations described in Section 170(b)(1)(A) of the IRC.

<sup>3</sup>As an alternative, a taxpayer can elect to limit his or her deduction to the income tax basis (not the fair market value) of the donated long-term capital gain property. If this election were made, the annual limit would be 50 percent of the contribution base. Normally, however, such an election would be of limited usefulness.

**Private Foundations** For gifts of appreciated property to private foundations (other than certain private operating foundations and nonoperating feeder foundations), in general, the deduction allowed is limited to the donor's income tax basis in the property. However, an exception to this general rule allows taxpayers to deduct the full fair market value (up to 20 percent of the contribution base) of appreciated publicly traded stock (qualified appreciated stock) given to private foundations.

**Short-Term Capital Gain Property** For gifts of appreciated property, which, if sold, would not produce long-term capital gain (e.g., capital assets held for 12 months or less and inventory held for sale) to public charities, the deduction is limited to the taxpayer's basis in the property and the annual limit is 50 percent of the contribution base.

**Tangible Personal Property** Finally, if appreciated tangible personal property (e.g., artwork), which, if sold, would produce long-term capital gain, are given to public charities whose function is related to the use of the property (e.g., a public art museum), the amount deductible is the full fair market value of the property and the annual limit is 30 percent of the contribution base. On the other hand, if the function of the public charity is unrelated to the use of the tangible personal property, the deduction is limited to the donor's basis in the property, but the annual limit is 50 percent of the contribution base.

**Carryover of Excess Charitable Deductions** Any unused charitable deduction for a given year that exceeds the annual limitation can be carried over for up to five additional years. The deductions during this five-year carryover period are subject to certain ordering provisions in the tax law.

## **Nonrecognition of Capital Gains on Donated Property**

No capital gain is realized and recognized by a donor when he or she gives appreciated property to charity. Correspondingly, if the donor can deduct the full fair market value of the appreciated property, in effect, the potential capital gain escapes taxation entirely. Furthermore, when a charity or a charitable remainder trust (CRT) sells appreciated property given to it, the donor does not realize any gain. The charity or CRT also does not realize gain because it is tax exempt.

## **Gift and Estate Tax Deductions for Transfers to Charity**

Eligible transfers to charity are deductible in full for federal gift tax purposes (for lifetime transfers) and for federal estate tax purposes (for transfers at death). They are also deductible for GST tax purposes.

## **Reporting and Valuation Requirements**

Contributions to a charity in excess of \$250 must be acknowledged by the charity in writing. The donor may also have to keep other records for contributions over \$250 and over \$500. Furthermore, if the claimed charitable deduction for an item of property or a group of similar items of property (other than money or publicly traded securities) exceeds \$5,000, the donortaxpayer must get a qualified appraisal of the property from a qualified appraiser and attach a summary to his or her tax return.

# **Planning Techniques Giving Appreciated Property**

One interesting technique that may be available to many persons is giving appreciated long-term capital gain property, such as common stock. Here the gift generally is deductible at its fair market value and no capital gain would be realized by the donor.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that Mary Whitcomb has owned common stock in a growth company for a long time and it has appreciated considerably. She would like to dispose of some of this stock to diversify her portfolio but has no offsetting losses. She also customarily gives about \$3,000 per year to her church. If she were to give \$3,000 worth of this stock (rather than her customary cash donation) to the church, she would be better off tax-wise and the church would get the same dollar donation (minus any selling expenses on the stock).

Let us see why. Assume that Mary's cost basis in the donated stock is \$300 and she and her husband are in a 33 percent federal income tax bracket. We shall compare the tax results of a gift to charity of the stock itself with the results of a sale of the stock, retaining the after-tax proceeds of the sale and making the investor's customary \$3,000 cash contribution to charity.

The net effect is a tax saving equal to the capital gains tax on the sale of the appreciated property. But this works only if the taxpayer is going to make a charitable contribution anyway.

**Capital Loss Property** On the other hand, if a person is holding property on which he or she has an unrealized capital loss, the reverse is true. The contributor is better off tax-wise first to sell the property and take the tax loss, and then to give the proceeds to charity in cash. That way, the contributor gets both the capital loss on the sale and the charitable deduction.

## **Making Split (Remainder) Gifts to Charity**

An increasingly popular approach to more sophisticated charitable giving is to make a gift now of a future interest in property to charity while retaining a present interest in the property for the donor and/or the donor's family. This is commonly done by giving a remainder interest in property to a charity. This involves the donor's retaining an intervening interest in the property for a period of years, or for one or more persons' lifetimes, and then when this interest ends, the property goes to the charity (i.e., the remainder interest to charity).4 This approach can be attractive in retirement or estate planning. However, the tax law permits this to be done only in certain ways: these are gift of a remainder interest in a personal residence or farm, use of a charitable remainder unitrust, use of a charitable remainder annuity trust, and use of pooled income funds.

4There also are other kinds of split gifts to charity. These are charitable lead trusts, where the charity receives the initial income interest and then a noncharitable beneficiary gets the remainder interest and joint ownership with a charity. These approaches are described later in this chapter.

**Gift of Remainder Interest in Personal Residence or Farm** A donor may give these types of real property to charity but reserve the right to live in or use the property for the remaining lifetime of the donor or the donor and his or her spouse. The donor gets a current income tax charitable deduction for the present value of the charity's remainder interest in the *depreciated value*  of the residence or farm. This type of future gift to charity does not require a formal trust. However, since improvements on the land (e.g., buildings) must be depreciated in calculating the charitable deduction, this approach may not be as attractive as it might first appear.

**Charitable Remainder Unitrust (CRUT)** A *charitable remainder trust (CRT),*  in general, involves the creation of a formal irrevocable trust into which the donor (as grantor of the trust) places property that is the subject of the charitable gift. There are two types of CRTs: the *charitable remainder unitrust* (CRUT) and the *charitable remainder annuity trust* (CRAT). We shall describe the CRUT in this section and the CRAT in the next.

*Straight Charitable Remainder Unitrust:* In this approach to a CRUT, the donor creates and places highly appreciated property into an irrevocable charitable trust under which the donor (or perhaps the donor and another beneficiary or beneficiaries after the donor's death) will receive a specified percentage (but no less than 5 percent or no more than 50 percent) of each year's current value of the trust assets for the beneficiary's lifetime or for a fixed period of years not exceeding 20 years. If trust income is not sufficient to pay the specified unitrust amount, trust corpus must be used to do so.

*Net Income with Makeup Charitable Remainder Unitrust (NIMCRUT):* A variation on the payout under a straight CRUT is the *net income with makeup charitable remainder unitrust* (NIMCRUT). In this case, the noncharitable income beneficiaries will receive the *lesser* of the stated unitrust amount (say, 5 percent of the trust corpus each year) or that year's actual accounting income of the trust. The trust also provides that to the extent its accounting income in any year is less than the stated unitrust amount, the difference is accumulated as trust principal and can be paid out to the income beneficiary(ies) in any future year to the extent that trust accounting income exceeds the stated unitrust amount. This is the makeup provision. A NIMCRUT, for example, can be useful in providing a deferred retirement plan for the donor and perhaps his or her spouse.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

As an illustration, suppose Harry Blum and his wife Amy are both age 55, in good health, work outside the home, and would like to retire at age 60 (in five years). Over the years, Harry has invested in several publicly traded growth common stocks that now have a combined market value of \$1,000,000, an income tax basis to Harry of \$400,000, and a current yield of about 1 percent. Harry and Amy have other assets and retirement plans as well. They feel they will need more income when they retire, but they do not need current income now. Harry and Amy are also charitably inclined.

Therefore, Harry decides to establish a NIMCRUT and place the \$1,000,000 of growth common stocks in it. The NIMCRUT provides that the lesser of the trust's accounting income or the unitrust amount—say, 5 percent of trust corpus—will be paid to Harry and Amy while both are alive and then to the survivor for the remainder of his or her lifetime. Upon the death of the last of them to die, the trust corpus will pass to their synagogue (a public charity) as remainderperson. The trust has a makeup provision.

In the year this trust is established, assume Harry and Amy are entitled to a charitable income tax deduction of about \$250,000,5 which is the present value at that time of the remainder interest that ultimately will go to the charity. Note that they probably will not be able to take the full amount of this deduction in the year the trust is established because of the annual limit on such deductions.

Table 19.1 shows how the payments to Harry and Amy and the makeup provision of this NIMCRUT would work in this situation. It is assumed the trust retains the growth stocks (or sells some or all of them and invests in similar growth stocks) for the first five years and then sells the growth stocks and invests in higher-yielding income-producing assets.6 No gain is realized by the trust on the sale because it is tax exempt. There also is no gain realized by Harry and Amy. The result is a substantial deferral of income until the noncharitable beneficiaries (Harry and Amy) retire. Under these assumptions, their annual income from the NIMCRUT will rise from \$15,735 to \$110,146 when they reach their planned retirement age of 60.

<sup>5</sup>This value depends on the actuarial value of Harry and Amy's unitrust life income interests, which, in turn, is based on an assumed mortality table and an interest rate. The mortality table is promulgated by the IRS and is revised every 10 years. The interest rate is the Section 7529 rate for the appropriate month.

<sup>6</sup>However, there can be no restrictions in the trust document as to how the trustee can invest trust assets. It is anticipated that the trustee will understand the nature of the transaction and the intentions of the parties.

**Table 19.1.** Operation of a Hypothetical Net Income with Makeup Charitable Remainder Unitrust

\*The assumptions underlying these figures are that for the first five years the trust invests in growth common stocks, with a 1 percent current yield and 12 percent annual capital growth. For the sixth and subsequent years, the trust invests in a diversified portfolio of bonds (U.S. Treasury bonds, investment-grade corporates, and some high-yield corporates) with diversified maturities (laddered). This bond portfolio has a 7 percent current yield and zero capital growth. Naturally, other investment assumptions can be, and often are, made.

† It is assumed that in this year the trust sells the common stock and buys the bonds. There is no gain to the trust because it is tax exempt, nor is there gain to Harry and Amy.

Clearly, the investment strategy for this kind of trust is critical. There is, of course, no assurance that the expected returns from growth stocks will actually be realized. Also, after the sale of the growth stocks, the trustee could follow a more diversified asset allocation strategy, such as using a combination of bonds and income-oriented common stocks, which would produce income but also more capital growth for the trust. A possible problem here, depending on the investment climate at the time, may be in achieving high enough current accounting income in the trust so the makeup provision can apply. Some advisers have suggested devices such as deferred annuities and partnerships, where permitted, in these trusts. Another possible approach, where allowed, is for the trust instrument to consider capital gains as accounting income.

*Net Income Charitable Remainder Unitrust:* Here the noncharitable beneficiaries receive the lesser of the stated unitrust amount or that year's actual accounting income of the trust. However, there is no makeup provision.

*Flip Unitrust:* This is another variation from the straight CRUT. In this case, a donor often contributes highly appreciated, nonliquid assets (such as closely held business interests or real estate) to a CRT. The CRT begins as a NIMCRUT (or a net income unitrust), but when the trustee later sells the appreciated asset, the CRT converts (flips) by its terms to be a straight CRUT. The advantage of this approach is that before the sale, the unitrust only has to pay the noncharitable beneficiary the accounting income, if any, from the trust. On the other hand, after the sale, the beneficiary is assured of receiving the unitrust amount even if the accounting income might be less.7 By its regulations, the IRS allows flip unitrusts. The flip must be based on some objective event, such as a beneficiary's reaching a certain age or the sale of an unmarketable asset. Also, after the flip, the trustee must pay at least annually the unitrust amount without any makeup payments that may have accrued before the flip.

**Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust (CRAT)** The CRAT uses essentially the same general concept as the charitable remainder unitrust, except that the return to the noncharitable income beneficiary must be a fixed or determined amount (again, no less than 5 percent or no more than 50 percent), calculated on the basis of the initial value of the property originally transferred to the trust. The CRAT does not have the variations in income payout that have just been described for the CRUT.

**Amount of Charitable Deduction** The current income tax deduction received by a donor to a CRT is equal to the actuarial present value of the remainder interest that ultimately will pass to the charity, valued as of the time the donor makes the gift to the CRT. This present value may depend on the type of CRT; the specified payment to the noncharitable beneficiary(ies); the term of the payments to the noncharitable beneficiary(ies), which may depend on the age(s) of the beneficiary(ies) and the mortality table assumed; and the Section 7520 interest rate for the month the gift is made (or for either of the two preceding months at the option of the taxpayer).

As explained in Chapter 3, the *Section 7520 rate* <sup>8</sup> is the interest rate to be used in valuing annuities, life interests or interests for a term of years, and remainder and reversionary interests for federal tax purposes. It is determined and published monthly by the government, and is 120 percent of the federal

<sup>7</sup>This is the difference between a flip unitrust and a regular NIMCRUT. In a regular NIMCRUT, if the accounting income is less than the percentage unitrust amount, only the accounting income will be paid to the noncharitable beneficiary.

<sup>8</sup>This rate is defined in Section 7520(a) of the IRC and is described in Chapter 3.

midterm rate for the month.9 The Section 7520 rate, in effect, is the rate the IRS assumes can be earned on assets. Other valuation factors also are prescribed in government tables. Computer software is available to aid advisers in calculating values needed in planning for CRTs, other charitable giving techniques, and other estate planning techniques.

**Taxation of Noncharitable Income Beneficiaries** The payouts received by noncharitable income beneficiaries of CRTs are taxed on a four-tier system for income tax purposes. To the extent that a CRT has present or accumulated income of the various types, distributions are first deemed to be ordinary income, second as capital gains, next as other income (such as tax-exempt income), and finally as a return of principal.

This means that if a CRT receives any ordinary income from its assets or any capital gains (such as from the sale of appreciated assets), the CRT itself will not have any taxable income because it is tax exempt, but as distributions are made to the noncharitable beneficiary(ies), they are considered to receive income under this system. Thus, if a CRT sells highly appreciated assets contributed to it, the capital gain ultimately will be taxed to the noncharitable beneficiaries as distributions are made to them. This is why a CRT can sometimes be said to act as an installment sales substitute.

**Minimum Remainders to Charity** The tax law requires that certain minimum remainder values must go to the charity under CRTs. First, the actuarial present value of the charitable remainder interest must equal at least 10 percent of a property's value when it is contributed to a CRT (the 10 percent test). Second, for CRATs, there cannot be greater than a 5 percent probability that the trust's corpus will be exhausted before the charity is supposed to receive something (the 5 percent test). Both tests must be met when applicable. In effect, this means that CRTs cannot be used when the charity's interests are negligible at their creation. Fortunately, the law permits CRTs to be reformed when their terms fail to meet the 10 percent test (or certain other requirements).

**Life Insurance and CRTs** Life insurance can be used to replace all or part of the value passing to charity after the death of the noncharitable income beneficiary(ies). When the donor is the income beneficiary, the life insurance would be on his or her life. When the donor and his or her spouse are income beneficiaries, the life insurance can be a second-to-die policy on both lives. The life insurance often is purchased and owned by an *irrevocable life insurance trust* (ILIT). (These trusts are described in Chapter 29.) The amount

<sup>9</sup>The *federal midterm rate* is the applicable federal rate determined on the basis of the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining maturities of three to nine years for each calendar month.

of life insurance needed depends on the circumstances. For example, it can be based on what the family otherwise might lose (after taxes) but for the creation of the CRT.

**Comparing CRUT to CRAT** As noted earlier, these are two distinct types of CRT. Each has advantages, depending on the circumstances.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that John Silver, age 65, is an executive of Growth Corporation, is planning to retire soon, and has a large part of his investment portfolio in highly appreciated Growth Corporation common stock (with a 1 percent current yield). John is married, and his wife, Lynn, also is age 65. John and Lynn have three adult children and six grandchildren. John would like to make a meaningful contribution to the university from which he graduated many years ago, mainly with the help of scholarship money.

One possibility is that John could transfer, say, \$600,000 of his highly appreciated Growth Corporation stock (which has an income tax basis to him of \$100,000) to a CRAT, with a 7 percent payout rate to John and his wife for as long as either of them lives. As a result, Mr. and Mrs. Silver would receive a fixed annual distribution of \$42,000 from the trust (\$600,000 r 0.07), and this amount will not change even if the corpus of the trust should rise or fall in value. If trust income is not sufficient to pay this amount, trust principal will have to be used to make up the difference. Then, upon the last of their deaths, the value at that time of the trust corpus will go outright to the university. The Silvers will get a current income tax deduction for the actuarial value of the charity's remainder interest. Finally, the Silvers will realize no capital gain from the appreciated stock transferred to the CRAT, and, of course, neither would the CRAT because it is tax exempt.

On the other hand, if John had used a CRUT with the same general terms, he and his wife would receive an annual distribution from the trust for their lifetimes of 7 percent of each year's value of the trust assets. Thus, if trust assets grow in value, their annual income correspondingly will grow, but if trust assets decline in value, the reverse will be true. Thus, to make an admittedly overly simplistic comparison, a unitrust may be better for donors and their families in the event of capital growth, while the annuity trust may provide donors and their families with a stable income in the face of declines in asset values (e.g., during recessions or depressions). There, of course, are other differences, such as possible use of NIMCRUTs to build greater future income and flip unitrusts. Also, after the trust is established, additional contributions can be made to a unitrust but not to an annuity trust.

**A Further Illustration with an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust**  Suppose now that Mr. and Mrs. Silver decide to contribute the \$600,000 of Growth Corporation stock to a 7 percent straight CRUT. Also assume they would be entitled to a current income tax deduction of \$155,382, which will be spread over several years because of the 30 percent of AGI annual limit. If the Silvers are in the 35 percent federal income tax bracket (ignoring any state or local income taxes for the sake of simplicity), their tax saving can be estimated as \$54,384 (0.35 r \$155,382).

Let us assume further that the trust sells the Growth Corporation stock for \$600,000 and invests the proceeds in a diversified portfolio of 50 percent of income-oriented common stocks and 50 percent of diversified, mostly investment grade, corporate bonds. Assume this portfolio yields a return of 5 percent from common stock dividends, 7 percent in taxable interest from the corporate bonds, and 3 percent in long-term capital growth from the common stocks (ignoring expenses of the trust). However, when the CRUT pays the annual 7 percent unitrust amount to Mr. and Mrs. Silver (which initially would be \$42,000, assuming the CRUT corpus is \$600,000); under the four-tier system for taxing the noncharitable beneficiaries, first to be taxed would be the interest on the corporate bonds as ordinary income and dividends from the common stocks as qualified dividends. Then the remainder would be taxed as capital gains because the CRUT realized those gains in the sale of the growth company stock. The remaining gains would constitute unrealized appreciation in the trust corpus, which would serve to increase future 7 percent payouts from the Thus, the after-tax annual return for the Silvers in the first year would be 5.25 percent or \$31,500 (0.0525 r \$600,000). This annual payout will grow if the CRUT corpus grows, but correspondingly, it will decline if the CRUT corpus declines. At the last of their deaths, the existing trust corpus will go to the university as remainderperson.

On the other hand, suppose that the Silvers do not contribute this stock to a CRUT as just described, but rather they either retain it or sell it and invest the proceeds to provide retirement income for themselves until the last of their deaths. At that time, the survivor would leave it to their children. Let us further suppose Mr. and Mrs. Silver decide to sell the \$600,000 of Growth stock and reinvest the net proceeds (after capital gains tax) in the same kind of diversified portfolio described previously for the CRUT.

They made this decision, despite having to pay a sizeable capital gains tax of \$75,000 (\$600,000 amount realized – \$100,000 adjusted basis = \$500,000 gain realized and recognized × 0.15 = \$75,000 tax), because their investable assets are far too concentrated in Growth Corporation stock, they want a more incomeoriented asset allocation strategy during retirement, and John still will have Growth Corporation common in his portfolio from other sources even after the sale.

After the sale, the Silvers will have \$525,000 of net proceeds (ignoring expenses of the sale) to invest. Assuming the same asset allocation and returns as previously, and that all investment income and gains are paid out currently to the Silvers, their corresponding after-tax annual return would be 5.67 percent of \$525,000, or \$29,767.

Now, assuming their joint life expectancies are about 20 years (or to age 85), the \$525,000 investment fund would be about \$525,000 after the last of their deaths (assuming all investment returns are paid out currently for retirement expenses). However, this amount would be in the gross estate for federal estate tax purposes of the last spouse to die, assuming adoption of a marital deduction strategy that results in no estate tax due at the first death. If we further assume that the surviving spouse's estate will be in the 45 percent federal estate tax bracket, the federal estate tax alone (ignoring any state death taxes and other estate settlement costs) will diminish this amount for their children to an estimated \$288,750. This is the estimated amount that might be lost to their family if the CRUT were used instead of retaining the property until the last death.

Therefore, at this point, the Silvers' annual retirement income situation from these two possibilities can be compared as follows:

| Contribution to the 7% CRUT                   |          |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------|
| After-tax annual income from CRUT             | \$31,500 |
| After-tax annual income from tax savings from |          |
| current charitable deduction on creating      |          |
| the CRUT (\$54,384 r 0.0567  \$3,084)10       | \$3,084  |
| Total retirement income                       | \$34,584 |

10This assumes the same after-tax total return as from the retained net assets.

Sale of appreciated stock and reinvestment of net proceeds After-tax annual income \$29,767

Clearly, the CRUT results in more after-tax retirement income for Mr. and Mrs. Silver. It also enables them to make a substantial and meaningful gift to their university. However, the issue of the loss of the otherwise retained property's value to their children and grandchildren remains.

It may be that Mr. and Mrs. Silver will feel that their other assets constitute a sufficient inheritance for their children and grandchildren. However, the Silvers may feel they do not want to reduce what their children and grandchildren will receive after both of them are gone. In this event, Mr. or Mrs. Silver can establish an ILIT to purchase, own, and be the beneficiary of a second-to-die life insurance policy on both their lives in an amount of approximately \$288,750 (or more, if desired). The level of premium needed to carry such a policy (on a male and a female, both age 65 and in good health) might be \$3,000 to \$4,000 per year. Mr. or Mrs. Silver could give approximately this amount each year to the trustee of the ILIT so the trustee could pay the premiums. Their children (and perhaps grandchildren) would be the beneficiaries of this trust.

**General Considerations Regarding CRTs** It can be seen that establishment of a charitable remainder unitrust or annuity trust is a complicated legal and financial transaction that requires the aid of the donor's professional advisers. These arrangements normally are practical only for larger gifts. It is possible for the donor-grantor to serve as trustee or co-trustee of the charitable trust. However, in this case, the donor must act in a fiduciary capacity. The trust may also contain a provision allowing the donor to change the charitable beneficiary to another eligible charity.

**Pooled Income Fund** The final way to make remainder gifts to charity is through pooled income funds maintained by many larger charities. These are funds in which the contributions of a number of donors are combined for investment purposes. In this sense, they are like mutual funds run by charities. Some larger charities maintain several pooled income funds with different investment objectives to meet the needs of their donors.

Like the previously described charitable remainder unitrusts and annuity trusts, a donor can make a gift of appreciated property and escape capital gains tax on the appreciation, get an immediate income tax deduction for the actuarial value of the charity's remainder interest, and receive an income from the fund for life or for a period of years. In the case of pooled income funds, however, the donor receives a certain number of units (the number depending on their current value and the amount contributed) in a particular pooled income fund. In addition, the donor gets the advantage of investment diversification through a well-managed fund or funds.

The annual income received by the donor or others is determined each year by the pooled income fund's investment return. Thus, before contributing to such a fund, a potential donor, or his or her advisers, should check into the fund's current and past investment returns as well as its investment objectives, much like one would before investing in a mutual fund or other financial intermediary.

To contribute to a pooled income fund, a donor does not have to create an individual trust. Thus, carefully selected pooled income funds can be a practical technique even for donors making smaller gifts. Of course, after the noncharitable income interest or interests expire, the property will go to the charity. Again, the donor (if insurable) can use life insurance to make up the loss to his or her family.

#### **Other Forms of Charitable Contributions**

**Charitable Gift Annuity** This is a different kind of arrangement from those discussed in the preceding sections. The *charitable gift annuity* is the sale of an annuity by a charity to a donor-annuitant for a price in excess of what would be charged for the same annuity by a commercial insurance company. This determines the income tax charitable deduction for the donorannuitant which is the projected remainder value going to the charity after the annuitant's death. The annuity income received by the donor-annuitant, and possibly other annuitants, varies with the annuitant's age and among charities. Many charities follow the annuity rate recommendations (called the Suggested Charitable Gift Annuity Rates) adopted by the American Council on Gift Annuities.11 Normally, a donor-annuitant would not consider such an annuity absent his or her charitable motive.

A gift annuity is a contract guaranteed by the charity. Therefore, a donorannuitant should consider the financial soundness of the charity, just as

<sup>11</sup>The council is an organization sponsored by a large number of charitable organizations. Use of its recommended rates is voluntary on the part of charities selling gift annuities. These annuity rates are designed to result in approximately a 50 percent return to the charity once the annuitant dies. However, some charities use gift annuity rates that are designed to produce greater returns for the charity (and thus less for the annuitants). This may be a point for potential donor-annuitants to check before purchasing a gift annuity from a charity.

an annuitant should evaluate the financial soundness of a life insurance company issuing a commercial annuity contract.

Charitable gift annuities are taxed under the general annuity rules. Therefore a portion of each annuity payment is an income tax–free return of investment in the contract, while the remainder is taxable investment income. Gift annuities can be purchased with appropriated assets. In this case, a portion of the gain (on the projected amount going to charity) is not taxed. This remainder is taxed pro-rata as the annuity payments are received. In effect, the tax on this portion of the capital gain is deferred.

**Gift of Undivided Portion of an Owner's Entire Interest in Property** This involves making the charity a co-owner of property. For example, a charity might be given one-half of a piece of artwork, with the donor retaining the other half. A current income tax deduction could be taken for the value of the charity's interest. However, the PPA of 2006 put substantial new requirements on donation of fractional interests in tangible personal property (such as art to an art museum) that limited the attractiveness of this strategy.

**Gift of Qualified Conservation Contributions or Easements** These contributions often involve the granting of conservation easements with respect to real estate to qualified charities or governments. An easement in gross (i.e., one not derived from the ownership of adjacent or other lands) is a personal interest in, or the right to use, the land of another. The tax law allows rather generous income tax deductions as well as estate and gift tax exclusions for qualified conservation contributions or easements.

A *qualified conservation contribution* is a contribution of a qualified real property interest to a qualified organization (governments and publicly supported charities) exclusively for conservation purposes. For purposes of this definition, *a qualified real property interest* includes a restriction (such as an easement) that is granted in perpetuity on the use of real property.12

*Income Tax Deduction:* A charitable deduction can be taken for the value of a qualified conservation contribution made during the donor's lifetime. The value of a contribution (such as a conservation easement) may be determined as the difference between the fair market value of the real property before the easement was granted and the fair market value after the easement was granted.13

<sup>12</sup>Other qualified real property interests are the entire interest of a donor other than a qualified mineral interest and a remainder interest.

<sup>13</sup> If there should happen to be substantial records of sales of similar easements, the value would be based on this. However, such sales or records may not be available.

*Estate Tax Exclusion:* An executor can exclude from a decedent's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes an applicable percentage (up to 40 percent) of the value of land subject to a qualified conservation easement up to a dollar exclusion limitation and subject to certain other requirements. The applicable percentage is 40 percent reduced by two percentage points for each one percentage point by which the value of the qualified conservation easement is less than 30 percent of the value of the land without regard to the value of the easement and reduced by the value of any retained development right. The dollar exclusion limitation is \$500,000. The easement may be made during the owner's lifetime or after his or her death.

On the other hand, a qualified conservation easement must be granted in perpetuity. It thus may lessen the future uses to which real property can be put and its future sales value.

**Bargain Sales to Charity** Sometimes donors do not want to give the full value of property to charity. Thus, the donor may sell the property to a charity for less than its fair market value—a bargain sale. However, such a bargain sale of appreciated property will be classified for tax purposes into two parts: a contribution portion (which is deductible) and a sale portion (which is taxable). The tax is determined by allocating the property's tax basis between the contribution portion and the sale portion based on the ratio of the sales price to the fair market value.

**Gifts of Closely Held Stock to Charity with a Redemption** Donors may own appreciated, closely held, corporate stock for which there is no ready market. Sometimes, an owner will give such stock to a charity with the informal understanding, but not a legally binding obligation on the part of the charity, that the stock will be redeemed by the corporation from the charity after the gift. The result is that the donor-stockholder has made a charitable contribution; he or she can take an income tax deduction for the fair market value of the stock (without realizing capital gain); the closely held corporation uses its cash to make the redemption from the charity without any tax effect on the donor-stockholder; and the charity ends up with cash, which is normally what it wants, rather than with closely held stock. This technique sometimes is called a *charity bailout.*

**Naming Charities as Death Beneficiaries of Qualified Retirement Plans and Traditional IRAs** If a person wants to make a charitable contribution at death in any event, a favorable way to do so from a tax point of view is to name the charity as beneficiary of part or all of the person's remaining account balances under defined contribution retirement plans or traditional IRAs. Death benefits payable to noncharitable beneficiaries under these plans are heavily taxed—first in the participant's or IRA owner's gross estate for federal estate tax (and perhaps state death tax) purposes, and then as IRD (with a deduction for any estate taxes paid on the IRD item) to the beneficiary for federal income tax purposes.14 These taxes are avoided when IRD items are made payable to (or are left to) charitable beneficiaries at death. Thus, a person can plan to use IRD items to fulfill charitable-giving objectives at death and then use non-IRD items, along with the remainder of any IRD items, for noncharitable gifts and bequests.15

**Gifts of Life Insurance to Charity** Sometimes, donors give life insurance policies on their lives to charity. When a donor absolutely assigns (i.e., gives array) all incidents of ownership in a policy to a charity, the donor-insured has made a deductible charitable contribution equal to the value of the policy at the time of the gift, plus additional deductible contributions if the donorinsured makes future premium payments on the policy.

**Charitable Lead Trusts** Charitable lead trusts, also called *charitable income trusts* or *front trusts,* are the reverse of the CRAT and CRUT described previously. In a lead trust, the charity receives an annuity interest based on the initial value of the trust's corpus (a charitable lead annuity trust, CLAT) or a unitrust interest based on the value of the trust's corpus each year (a charitable lead unitrust, CLUT) for a fixed period, after which the remainder interest goes to noncharitable beneficiaries, such as the donor's family. These trusts can be created during a donor's lifetime as a living trust or under his or her will as a testamentary trust.

Charitable lead trusts can be attractive when a donor wants to make a meaningful charitable contribution, his or her family does not need current income from the property, and the donor wants to get a significant gift or estate tax deduction for the present value (using Section 7520 rates) of the charity's income interest.

For example, suppose Harry Carter would like to make lifetime gifts of about \$1,000,000 each to his two adult children from a previous marriage. The children are successful in their careers and do not need current income. Harry also would like to make a meaningful charitable gift to a local hospital. Furthermore, assume that Harry has more than enough other assets for himself, his present wife, and the children of his second marriage. In this situation, Harry might create a living charitable lead annuity trust with \$2,000,000 of his assets that will pay a 7 percent annuity interest (\$140,000 per year) to the hospital for 10 years and then pay the remainder to Harry's

<sup>14</sup>The nature of such IRD treatment was explained in Chapter 10.

<sup>15</sup>Planning for taking distributions from retirement plans in general is discussed in Chapter 16.

two children in equal shares. The present value of the hospital's annuity interest for 10 years (using a 6 percent Section 7520 interest rate) would be \$1,030,412. Harry can take a gift tax charitable deduction for this amount, and so the taxable gift for federal gift tax purposes would be the present value of the remainder interest to his two children after 10 years, or \$969,588 (\$2,000,000 – \$1,030,412).16 It may be noted that if the actual investment returns on the assets in the charitable lead trust exceed the Section 7520 interest rate, such as by investing the CLAT's assets for growth, the taxable remainder interest will be undervalued for gift tax purposes and the donor's family will benefit (i.e., each adult child will receive more than one-half of \$969,588 in 10 years). On the other hand, if the trust earns less than the Section 7520 rate, the reverse will be true. Also, as explained in Footnote 16, no gift tax actually would be paid by Harry.

### **When to Make Charitable Contributions**

Charitable contributions can be made during a donor's lifetime or at death under his or her will. From a tax perspective, it normally is better to make charitable gifts during life, because the donor gets an income tax deduction for the value of the gift, and, effectively, the gift amount (minus the income tax saving) is removed from his or her gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. Gifts at death get only a federal estate-tax charitable deduction. Of course, tax factors are not the only consideration in this decision.

16Harry would have to file a gift tax return, but assuming he has not made any previous taxable gifts, his applicable exclusion amount of \$1,000,000 for gift tax purposes (based on a unified credit of \$345,800) will more than offset the gift tax due on this transfer. Thus, no gift tax will actually be payable at this time. However, Harry will have used up most of his applicable exclusion amount, which will not be available for future lifetime gifts or at his death for estate tax purposes.
