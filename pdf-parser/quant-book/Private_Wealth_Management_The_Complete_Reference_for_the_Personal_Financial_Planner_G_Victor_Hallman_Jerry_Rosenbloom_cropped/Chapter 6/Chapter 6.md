## **Real Estate**

Historically, real estate has been a widely used investment medium for income and capital gains. Many people have an investment in real estate, in a sense, in that they own their house, or their condominiums, or cooperative apartments. Many people also own a second or vacation home. Others own income-producing properties or REITs as an investment. A few have larger real estate interests of various kinds.

#### **Advantages of Real Estate as an Investment**

**Attractive Total Returns on Equity** It is possible to earn a higher-thanaverage total after-tax return on well-selected real estate investments. This may result from the inherent advantages of owning well-selected real estate, the use of financial leverage, and tax advantages. One difficulty in comparing the yields on real estate with those of other investments is that there are specialized concepts for measuring real estate returns, and some of them are quite complex. They are beyond the scope of this book. However, to give a point of reference, here is a simple formula used in real estate as a rough rule of thumb for comparing the operating yields on different investment properties:

Operating rate of return = net operating income from property before interest and depreciation purchase price for property

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

To illustrate, suppose an investor purchased a small apartment house for \$800,000. To finance the property, the investor paid \$120,000 down in cash and took a \$680,000 25-year, 7.5 percent mortgage on the property. Considering the local real estate market, the investor expects net operating income (NOI) and the market price for the real estate to increase at about 2 percent per year (perhaps an optimistic expectation considering the economic envirornment as of this writing). Thus, if current annual NOI annual revenue (rents) minus property taxes, other expenses of operation, and minus an allowance for apartment vacancies, but before interest, depreciation, and income taxes are deducted—is \$64,000, the operating rate of return is as follows:

Operating rate of return 
$$=$$
  $\frac{$64,000}{$800,000} = 0.08 \text{ or } 8.0\%$ 

The taxable income for federal income tax purposes for the first year of operation would be as follows:

| NOI                   | \$64,000   |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Minus:                |            |
| Depreciation          | 24,400     |
| Interest paid         | 51,000     |
| Taxable income (loss) | (\$11,400) |

The depreciation in this example assumes that about \$672,000 of the \$800,000 purchase price (84 percent) is allocated to the building and its improvements (the depreciable portion of the property). Land cannot be depreciated. Depreciation is taken on a straight-line basis over a 27.5-year useful life. Note that depreciation is a noncash expense that serves to reduce current taxable income. This is the main *tax-shelter* aspect of real estate as an investment.

It can be seen that this real estate investment will produce a loss for federal income tax purposes in its first year. An important issue is whether the investor will be able to deduct this loss against other taxable income (i.e., use it to shelter other income). This issue is explored later in this chapter with respect to the passive activity loss (PAL) rules. However, unless the investor is a real estate professional or the individual taxpayer exception applies, this loss would be a PAL and deductible currently only against passive activity income.

The taxable income (loss) from this property will change over time. The NOI may rise or fall, depending on real estate market conditions and operating expenses. The interest paid will decline as the amortizing mortgage is paid off, and depreciation will reduce the basis for the property.

**Availability of Substantial Financial Leverage** *Leverage* is simply the use of borrowed funds to try to increase the rate of return that can be earned on the investor's own funds invested in a project. In general, when the cost of borrowing is less than what can be earned on the investment, it is considered *favorable leverage* (or a *positive carry*), but when the reverse is true, it is called *unfavorable leverage* (or a *negative carry*).1 The example just given has favorable leverage because the operating rate of return on the property is greater than the interest rate being paid on the mortgage.

Real estate investors typically employ substantial financial leverage—often from 60 to 90 percent of a property's value. They may also use leverage to pyramid their real estate holdings through refinancing of appreciated properties, reinvestment, and tax-free exchanges (covered later in this chapter). In the simple illustration used here, 85 percent of the initial purchase price was financed through a mortgage loan, while the investor's initial equity in the property was \$120,000 (\$800,000 value minus \$680,000 mortgage).

**Favorable Cash Flow** Good-quality income property normally will produce a *favorable cash flow.* This is because it should produce a reasonable NOI and because depreciation is a noncash expense that will diminish taxable

<sup>1</sup>Leverage can also be viewed as the use of borrowed funds with the hope that the value of the real estate will increase at a faster rate than the cost of borrowing the funds. This is a more risky view of leverage.

income but not cash flow. *Cash flow* for the first year of our example can be calculated as follows:

| NOI (first year)                   | \$64,000 |
|------------------------------------|----------|
| Minus:                             |          |
| Annual debt service (principal and |          |
| interest on mortgage loan)         | 53,900   |
| Cash flow before tax               | \$10,100 |
| Minus:                             |          |
| Income tax payable                 | (3,990)2 |
| Cash flow after tax                | \$14,090 |

If, however, the investor cannot take the \$11,400 loss against other income because of the PAL rules and has no passive activity income to reduce, the first year's cash flow will be the same as the before-tax figure. Even in this case, however, the investor can reduce future taxable income through the accumulated, suspended PALs (if he or she later has passive activity income to offset), by selling the real estate in a fully taxable transaction, or to some extent at death.

**Hedge against Inflation** Real estate, like other equity investments, is considered a hedge against inflation. This is because property values and rents tend to rise during inflationary periods.

**Tax Advantages** First, as just noted, improved real estate allows the investor to take depreciation as a noncash income tax deduction. However, if the real estate is later sold in a taxable transaction, the depreciation previously deducted will reduce the property's income tax basis and result in a correspondingly higher capital gain (or lower capital loss). Thus, in the case of a subsequent sale, the depreciation deduction really defers the tax and converts gain from ordinary income to a capital gain.

Second, the costs to operate and maintain property, such as property taxes, management fees, insurance, and repairs, are deductible. Third, real estate can be traded or exchanged for like-kind property on a tax-free basis under Section 1031 of the IRC.

Fourth, on the sale of investment real estate, any gain normally is a capital gain.3 In addition, an installment sale can be arranged so that any capital gain

<sup>2</sup>The income tax payable figure here is negative because it represents the reduction in the tax otherwise payable by the investor, due to the \$11,400 loss for tax purposes. It assumes the investor is in the 35 percent marginal income tax bracket (\$11,400 × 0.35 = \$3,990).

<sup>3</sup>However, for certain depreciable real property (such as residential real property), net capital gain attributable to allowable depreciation on the property will be taxed at a maximum rate of 25 percent rather than the normal 15 percent maximum rate on net capital gains.

will be spread over the installment period. Finally, since borrowing against real estate is not considered a sale or exchange for tax purposes, refinancing real estate traditionally has been a way for taking value out of the real estate without incurring capital gains taxation.

### **Limitations of Real Estate as an Investment**

**Lack of Marketability** There is usually relatively slow marketability in real estate. It can take substantial time to buy or sell real estate. Furthermore, the expenses of buying and selling are relatively high.

**Need for Large Initial Investment** A relatively large initial investment often is required. In the illustration used previously, for example, the investor would need \$120,000 (equity) to purchase the apartment house.

**Real Estate Cycles and Leverage** It may be difficult to determine the proper value for real estate, particularly for the uninitiated. Real estate is not uniform and there are definite cycles in the real estate market. Also, during the down phase of the cycle, the very financial leverage that was so attractive when real estate prices (and rents) were rising works against the investor.

**High Risk Level** Real estate is considered by many to be an inherently risky form of investment. It is fixed in location and character. Also, real estate values will fall during a period of economic recession or depression as rapidly as, or perhaps even more rapidly than, other kinds of equity investments.

### **How Investments in Real Estate Can Be Held**

**Individual and Joint Ownership** First, investors can simply buy property in their own names or as joint tenants or tenants in common with someone else. This is the traditional way of holding real estate, but it limits the size of the investment that can be made to the amount of capital the investor and perhaps a few others can raise.

**Partnerships** Many individuals invest in real estate by buying units in limited partnerships (LPs) that hold real estate. The LP has been a common vehicle for real estate investment, with investors as the limited partners and a promoter, builder, or developer as the general partner. In this way, the limited partners can invest their capital with only limited liability for partnership debts, and the earnings or losses from the real estate can be passed through the partnership organization to the individual limited partners without being taxed to the partnership. The earnings or losses are taxable to (or, to the extent permitted by tax law, deductible by) the individual partners.

The general partners manage the real estate investment. But note the importance of the character, ability, and experience of the general partners because they are in control. Also, real estate LP interests generally have limited marketability and liquidity. There are some secondary markets for these interests, but investors who dispose of their LP interests before the partnership itself terminates usually must accept large price discounts. Real estate could also be owned through limited liability companies (LLCs), which are also pass-through entities for tax purposes (see Chapter 31).

**Tenant in Common Interest** In this arrangement, real estate managers acquire properties and then sell or exchange interests in the properties to investors. The investors hold their interests as tenants in common, which is a partial ownership interest in the whole property (such as a 2 percent ownership interest, for example). (See Chapter 25 for a description of the legal nature of tenancy in common.) The real estate manager then manages the property for the tenant-in-common owners.

This arrangement is a way for investors to diversify their real estate investments among a number of properties. It also enables them to invest in larger properties that they might not be able to afford on their own or through partnerships or LLCs. The IRS has ruled that tenant-in-common interests are eligible for Section 1031 exchanges, which are described later in this chapter.

**Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)** A REIT is similar in concept to a closed-end investment company. (See Chapter 8 for a description of closedend funds.) It is a corporation or business trust that meets the tax law requirements to be a REIT and invests primarily in real estate. A REIT can give investors the advantages of centralized management, limited liability, continuity of interests, and transferability of ownership (marketability). Furthermore, a REIT can avoid the corporate income tax by distributing most or all of its earnings to its shareholders. The distribution is then taxed to the shareholders as ordinary income or capital gains. However, unlike partnerships or LLCs, REITs are not allowed to pass losses through to their shareholders for tax purposes.

REITs vary considerably in size, origin, and types of real estate investments made. Therefore, investors should consider the investment objective of any REIT. Also, the management of a REIT is critical. Shares of many REITs are traded on organized stock exchanges.

There are three general types of REITs, in terms of their investment approach. *Equity REITs* derive their revenues primarily from rental income and capital gains from properties they own. *Mortgage REITs* receive their revenues mainly from interest income from mortgage loans they make. *Hybrid REITs*

are combinations of the equity and mortgage approaches. REITs may also specialize in particular kinds of real estate or mortgage loans.

**Subaccounts in Tax-Advantaged Plans** Some qualified retirement plans, variable annuities, and possibly variable life insurance plans have subaccounts invested in real estate that participants or owners can select. However, since the investment income of these plans is not taxable currently and all distributions from them are taxed as ordinary income, the tax advantages of direct real estate investments or investments through partnerships or LLCs essentially are lost when real estate is held through these plans.

#### **Kinds of Real Estate Investments**

In terms of investment and tax considerations, real estate can be classified as follows:

- N Unimproved land (bare land)
- N Improved real estate (held for rental), including:
  - New and used residential property (apartment houses and the like)
  - Low-income housing
  - Old buildings and certified historic structures
  - Other income-producing real estate (such as office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses, hotels and motels, and various industrial and commercial properties)
- N Mortgages
- N Vacation and second homes

### **Disposition of Investment Real Estate**

At some point, real estate investors may want to dispose of properties. Depending on the circumstances and the owner's objectives, there are several approaches to doing so.

**Cash Sale** In this case, the investor sells the property and gets the purchase price within one year. Using the previous case example, suppose our investor holds the apartment house for 10 years and then sells it for cash. Assuming the market price increases by 2 percent per year, the sale price would be approximately \$975,000. The outstanding mortgage has declined to about \$600,000 and the investor's income tax basis in the property now is \$556,000 (which is the original basis of \$800,000 reduced by annual depreciation of \$24,400 for 10 years, or \$244,000).4

<sup>4</sup>This assumes there have been no other changes in basis (such as improvements to the property that would increase basis).

| Given these facts, the tax status of this sale would be as follows: |           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Sale price                                                          | \$975,000 |
| Minus:                                                              |           |
| Transaction costs (at 7%)                                           | 68,250    |
| Adjusted basis (\$800,000 minus                                     |           |
| accumulated depreciation of \$244,000)                              | 556,000   |
| Long-term capital gain                                              | \$350,750 |
| Amount of gain attributable to depreciation                         |           |
| taxed at 25% (\$244,000 × 25% = \$61,000)5                          | 61,000    |
| Remainder of net capital gain                                       |           |
| taxed at 15% (\$106,750 × .15)                                      | 16,012    |
| Total tax payable                                                   | \$ 77,012 |
|                                                                     |           |

In addition, if the investor has suspended PALs,6 he or she can use them against passive and nonpassive income in the year the entire interest in a passive activity (the apartment house, in this case) is disposed of. The suspended PALs are used first against the income or gain from the passive activity disposed of, then against passive income from any other passive activities, and finally against nonpassive income or gain (e.g., salary, interest, or dividends).

The after-tax equity position of the investor then would be as follows:

| Sale price                    | \$975,000 |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Minus:                        |           |
| Transaction costs (at 7%)     | 68,250    |
| Mortgage loan balance         | 600,000   |
| Capital gains tax payable     | 77,0127   |
| Net after-tax equity position | \$229,738 |

As a result, the investor would have this cash for other investments or other purposes. However, the investor would realize and recognize capital gain in the year of the sale. The investor also would have received the annual cash flow from the property for the 10 years.

**Installment Sale** An *installment sale* occurs when payment for an asset is made over more than one taxable year.8 Any taxes due are payable pro rata as each installment payment is made as described next.

<sup>5</sup> See Footnote 3. This portion of the gain is referred to as "unrecaptured IRC Section 1250 gain." There would be no ordinary income in this case because the residential real estate always has been depreciated on a straight-line basis.

<sup>6</sup> See the discussion of the PAL rules later in this chapter.

<sup>7</sup>This would be reduced by any tax savings from suspended PALs, as just explained.

<sup>8</sup> If a sale so qualifies, the installment method of taxation must be used unless the taxpayer (seller) affirmatively elects not to use it.

When the installment method of taxing gains (not losses) from sales is used, each payment is divided into parts for tax purposes consisting of untaxed return of basis, taxable capital gains (taxed at 15 percent or 25 percent depending on the circumstances), and interest on the installment payments (at least equal to the applicable federal rate as described in Chapter 3), which is taxable as ordinary income.9 To determine the amount of capital gain that is taxable each year, a gross profit ratio (percentage) is calculated. This is the gross profit on the sale divided by the price paid for the property. The gross profit ratio is then multiplied by each installment payment to determine the portion of the payment that is a taxable gain. The remainder of the payment (after considering the interest) is the untaxed return of basis. As an illustration, in the previous Case Example, if an installment sale were being made, the profit ratio for the apartment house would be the gross profit (\$350,750) divided by the sale price (\$975,000) or 35.97 percent.

If a part of any taxable gain on depreciable property is taxable at 25 percent, this is taken into account before the 15 percent gain part. Interest on the installment payments is taxable as ordinary income.

The installment method can be used for most kinds of property, with some important exceptions. One exception is sales of stock or securities that are traded on an established securities market. Thus, publicly held (traded) stocks and other securities are not eligible for installment sale treatment. Also, to the extent provided by IRS regulations, sales of other kinds of property that are regularly traded on established markets are not eligible. Furthermore, dispositions of real or personal property by dealers in such property are excluded.

Real estate is often sold on an installment basis. Sales of closely held (private) corporation stock and other such business interests also can receive installment sale treatment, as can other kinds of property. To the seller, the main advantage of an installment sale is the deferral of the capital gains tax on the payments still to be made over the installment period. The buyer, on the other hand, does not have to have the entire purchase price available when the sale is made but can pay it over the installment period. However, when property is sold in this fashion, the seller still retains some credit risk that the buyer may not make the future payments.

**Like-Kind Exchanges** These are tax-deferred exchanges of similar (*like-kind*) property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment under Section 1031 of the IRC. These transactions are often called *like-kind*

<sup>9</sup> In some cases, a portion of the gain will be taxable as ordinary income referred to as "recaptured ordinary income under IRC Section 1250." This usually comes from "excess depreciation" which results from taking depreciation deductions (when permitted) in excess of that which would be allowed under straight line depreciation.

*exchanges* or *Section 1031 exchanges.* They are important in real estate because they allow a property owner to exchange property for other real estate without recognizing capital gain on the property exchanged. Thus, an investor can change holdings with no or limited tax consequences by selling his or her property (called the relinquished property) and then buying other real estate (called the replacement property). These transactions are carried out through "qualified intermediaries" who handle the sale and purchase. The tax rules for like-kind exchanges are complex and must be carefully followed to secure nonrecognition treatment. The income tax basis of an owner in the property being exchanged carries over to the new property received.

These Section 1031 nonrecognition exchanges do not apply to stocks, bonds, notes, other securities, and similar property. They also do not apply to exchanges of property held for personal use (such as a family residence). However, if, say, a personal residence is converted to use as a business or investment property for a substantial period, it may become eligible for likekind exchange treatment.

Like-kind exchanges may involve the receipt of *boot* in addition to the exchanged properties. Boot is cash or personal property (unlike property) received in addition to the like-kind exchanged real estate. Boot may be necessary to even out the values in an exchange. The receipt of boot will result in current taxation to the extent of the boot. The remainder of the gain will not be recognized.

**Refinancing of Properties** While not technically a disposition of real estate, refinancing allows owners of appreciated real estate to get cash out of their properties without taxation. However, it also means they will increase their leverage (debt), with the resulting risks or benefits.

If, for example, after 10 years the investor in our previous case example decided to refinance the apartment house with a mortgage at 85 percent of its current appraised value (\$975,000) instead of selling or exchanging it, the following would be the result (ignoring the expenses of refinancing):

| New mortgage loan (85% of \$975,000) | \$828,750 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| Minus:                               |           |
| Current mortgage loan balance        | 600,000   |
| Cash available from refinancing      | \$228,750 |

The investor could use this cash as equity for the purchase of additional real estate (and thus pyramid his or her real estate portfolio), invest it elsewhere, or use it for other purposes.

**Gifting of Property Interests** Real estate, like other property, can be given away to family members as part of an estate-planning gifting program. The advantages and disadvantages of lifetime giving are explored in Chapter 27.

## **Oil and Gas Ventures**

These can be risky investments, but they can yield handsome returns if successful. They tend to be specialized investments, and their economic characteristics are beyond the scope of this book.

Some basic tax incentives exist for oil and gas investments.

- N The deduction from income of intangible drilling costs (IDCs), which could be up to 80 or 90 percent of the initial cost of a productive well. The tax law permits persons with a *working interest* in oil and gas drilling operations (i.e., persons who generally have unlimited liability for their own share of the costs) to deduct their losses from these operations against other taxable income. This also may be true if the investor agrees to become a general partner (with unlimited liability) in the venture. However, a limited partnership interest (with limited liability) is not such a working interest, and losses of limited partners normally would be PALs.
- N A percentage depletion allowance of 15 percent of gross revenue, which taxpayers can deduct from their gross incomes from oil and gas investments.
- N However, the amounts an investor writes off for IDCs and depletion reduce his or her basis in the oil and gas interest. Under certain conditions, these amounts also may be tax-preference items for alternative minimum tax purposes.

People can, of course, invest directly in oil and gas operations. However, oil and gas partnerships are offered to the public as a way of investing in oil and gas.

## **Other Tax Shelters**

Other kinds of tax-sheltered investments include cattle feeding and other farming enterprises; horse and cattle breeding; timber, mineral and mining operations; equipment leasing; movies; and research and development ventures, among others. Space does not permit a discussion of each of them in this book.

## **Impact of Passive Activity Loss Rules**

The kinds of investments just described traditionally have been called *taxsheltered investments* because losses (even though they may not have been real economic losses) were used to reduce an investor's other taxable income.10

<sup>10</sup>While the term *tax-sheltered investments* traditionally has been used as just described, it may also be loosely used to describe many other tax-favored arrangements.

Such tax losses might arise, for example, from depreciation in real estate investments and intangible drilling costs and percentage depletion in oil and gas ventures.

#### **The Issue**

The result was that many high-income persons invested in tax shelters with the aim of reducing their taxable income. They may have used nonrecourse loans to finance their investments. Naturally, it was hoped that the taxsheltered investments would show a profit at some point; then the investor could sell them and take the gains at least partially as capital gains. Investors could also continually make new tax-sheltered investments and get new losses.

Because of alleged abuses in tax-sheltered investments, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 adopted the PAL rules. The main concept of the PAL rules is to prohibit taxpayers (with some exceptions) from using what are defined as *passive activity losses* to offset, or *shelter*, other kinds of taxable income.

#### **What Constitutes a Passive Activity**

For purposes of these rules, a passive activity is (1) a trade or business in which the taxpayer does not *materially participate* on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis11 or (2) an activity primarily involving the rental of property, whether the taxpayer materially participates or not. Thus, rental activities (including rental real estate) generally are passive, regardless of material participation by the owners. There is an exception to this rule for real estate in the case of real estate professionals who materially participate in the rental activity. The law defines such persons quite strictly. There is also an individual real estate investor exception, as explained shortly.

### **Who Is Affected**

Taxpayers affected by these rules include any individual acting as an individual, a partner in a partnership, a member of an LLC, or a stockholder in an S corporation; estates; trusts; and certain closely held C corporations. When there is passive activity, the tax law provides that expense deductions in excess

<sup>11</sup>There also are objective tests in the income tax regulations as to what the statutory term *materially participates* means. For example, a taxpayer is considered to materially participate in an activity if he or she participates more than 500 hours during the year, or if he or she participates more than 100 hours and no one else had greater participation, or if his or her participation during the year constituted substantially all the participation of anyone, among other tests.

#### **Real Estate and Other Equity Investments 159**

of income (i.e., passive activity losses) generally may be used only to offset passive activity income from other passive activities. Thus, PALs may not be used to offset income from other sources, such as salary or personal earnings (called *personal service income*), taxable interest and dividends (referred to as *portfolio income*), and taxable income from *active business pursuits* (i.e., a trade or business in which the taxpayer materially participates).

However, unused PALs are not lost entirely. They are merely suspended until the taxpayer can use them against passive activity income in the future (if any) or until the taxpayer sells the passive activity in a fully taxable transaction (at which time they can be taken against other income as previously described) or to a certain extent at the death of the taxpayer.

#### **Individual Real Estate Investor Exemption**

There is a special exemption from these rules that allows an individual taxpayer who "actively participates" in a rental activity to deduct up to \$25,000 of losses from rental real estate each year from his or her taxable income from other sources, provided the taxpayer's adjusted gross income (AGI) is less than \$100,000. For taxpayers with AGIs over \$100,000, this \$25,000 exemption is phased out by reducing it by 50 percent of the amount the taxpayer's AGI exceeds \$100,000.12

## **Put and Call Options**

Trading in options to buy or sell common stocks (*calls* or *puts*) on organized exchanges is a technique used by some investors. A *call* is an option allowing the buyer to purchase from someone a certain stock or other asset at a set price (called the *exercise* or *strike price*) at any time within a specified period. A *put* is an option allowing the buyer to sell to someone a certain stock or other asset at a set price at any time within a specified period. Options normally are for round lots (100 shares) of common stock. The expiration date is the last day on which the holder of an option can exercise it. Listed options have standardized quarterly expiration dates.

#### **Buying Options**

People may buy options when they want to speculate on whether a stock is going up or down or is going to fluctuate beyond certain limits or for other reasons. The price paid for the option is called the premium.

<sup>12</sup>Thus, the phase-out occurs with AGIs between \$100,000 and \$150,000.

#### **160 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

For example, suppose a person thinks XYZ common stock is too low and the price soon will go up. In this case, he or she might buy a call option for XYZ common. Furthermore, suppose that on June 1, XYZ common is selling at \$62 a share and that a listed XYZ common October 60 call option is purchased for a premium of \$7 per share, or \$700 for the 100-share option. This means that for \$700 (excluding commissions, for the sake of simplicity), the person has purchased a standardized contract allowing him or her to buy (call) 100 shares of XYZ common stock at \$60 per share (the exercise price) at any time prior to the end of October (the expiration date). Now if XYZ common climbs to \$72 a share by September 1, the October 60 call will become more valuable in the listed options market and, let us say, the premium for this option is \$13 per share on September 1. If the person decides to close out the option position on September 1, he or she would sell the call option for \$13 per share. In this case, the profit (excluding commissions) would be as follows:

| June 1—Purchased call option for      | \$700 |
|---------------------------------------|-------|
| September 1—Sold call option for      | 1,300 |
| Profit on the three-month transaction | \$600 |

It can be seen that this profit is 85 percent of the \$700 premium for the option, while the price of the underlying stock rose only 16 percent (from \$62 to \$72 per share). But if the price of XYZ common stays around \$62 or declines during the five-month period, the option buyer will lose the \$700 premium and suffer a 100 percent loss. However, the option buyer's risk of loss will be limited to the premium paid for the option.

While leveraged speculation is the main reason for buying calls, there are other possible reasons, such as to sell some existing investments to release cash while still maintaining a short-term market position, to protect against short-term market uncertainty, and to have a hedge against short sales.

On the other hand, if the person thinks XYZ common stock is overpriced and soon will fall substantially, he or she might buy a put option. It would work the same way as a call, except in the opposite direction.

Another reason for buying puts may be to protect an investment position from the risk of a declining market. As explained in Chapter 11, buying put options can be part of investment *collar transactions* designed to protect the value of highly appreciated stocks from market declines without actually selling the stocks and realizing capital gains.

More sophisticated traders can engage in a variety of option techniques. One is the *straddle,* in which a put and a call on the same stock are purchased with the same exercise price and expiration month. Here the speculator will profit if the underlying stock's price moves far enough in either direction to more than offset the premiums on both options.

#### **Selling (Writing) Options**

The motivation for selling call options normally is entirely different from the motivation for buying them. The option writer typically wants to secure an attractive yield on an existing investment. This increased yield comes from the premiums received by the option writer on the options granted to buyers. The option writer, however, gives up the opportunity for capital appreciation on stock he or she owns that is called away. But if the price of the stock declines, the option writer bears this risk (except that the writer still has the premium for the call).

But writing so-called *naked* call options is highly speculative. These are options where the writer does not own the underlying security. Generally, calls should be sold only on securities in the option writer's portfolio or on securities purchased for this purpose. Also, puts should be sold only against cash and only on stock the writer would otherwise want in his or her portfolio.

Selling call options is the other part of investment collar transactions noted previously and described in Chapter 11.

### **New Issues or Initial Public Offerings**

Stocks and bonds offered by corporations for the first time are called *new issues* or *initial public offerings (IPOs).* Some have been offered by corporate giants, but most new issues are made by smaller, lesser known, or newly formed corporations. Many of them do not have an established track record of operations and earnings. Hence, they are often speculative. Some investors, however, like to buy such new issues as speculations. Those that prove successful offer phenomenal gains for their original buyers. There also may be rapid, initial run-ups in price immediately after an IPO. But many such issues do not prove successful in the long run.

### **Commodity Futures Trading**

People usually engage in commodity futures trading in the hope of profiting from price changes in one or more basic commodities, including wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, potatoes, platinum, copper, silver, orange juice, cocoa, eggs, frozen pork bellies, lumber, and iced broilers. One can speculate on price changes in these commodities by buying and selling futures contracts.

A *futures contract* is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity at a price stated in the agreement on a specified future date. While futures contracts call for the delivery of the commodity (unless the contract is liquidated before it matures), this is rarely done. Speculators in commodity futures usually close out their positions before the contracts mature. This way, the commodity itself never actually changes hands among speculators. On the other hand, contracts to buy or sell the physical commodities are made in the cash (or *spot*) market.

As an illustration, suppose a person thinks the price of corn is going up. He or she might enter into a futures contract to buy 5,000 bushels of corn (a full contract in corn) for delivery in December at a price of \$3 per bushel, which would be the market price for December corn at the time the buy order was executed (assuming it was a market order). This is referred to as being *long* in the commodity. Now suppose the person is correct and in a month the price of December corn futures rises 20 cents per bushel to \$3.20. The speculator now might decide to close out the transaction by selling 5,000 bushels of December corn and taking a profit of 20 cents per bushel, or a total of \$1,000 (5,000 × 0.20 = \$1,000), excluding commissions and other costs. However, the speculator could have magnified this profit through the leverage of trading on margin. Margin requirements in commodities are relatively low—usually 5 to 10 percent of the value of the commodity traded. If the margin requirement in this example had been 10 percent, the speculator would have had to deposit with the broker only \$1,500 as security for the futures contract that had a value of \$15,000. Thus, such leverage can magnify a speculator's potential profits (and losses) in terms of the amount the speculator actually puts up. Of course, if the price of December corn futures had declined and the speculator had closed out the transaction, he or she would have suffered similar speculative, leveraged losses.

Suppose, instead, that the speculator thinks the price of corn is too high and is going down. In this case, he or she would sell short and might, for example, enter into a futures contract to sell 5,000 bushels of corn for delivery in December at a price of \$3 per bushel. Of course, if the price of December corn futures rises and the speculator covers the short position, he or she will lose on the transaction. Many other techniques for dealing in commodity futures exist but are not discussed here.

A word of caution is in order. While the opportunities for speculative profits in commodity futures trading can be enormous and quick, the risks are equally so. Trading in commodity futures is inherently speculative and risky.

### **Gold and Other Precious Metals**

In their asset allocations, some investors want to have a portion (such as 5 to 10 percent) of their portfolios in gold or other precious metals. In recent years, the price of gold has fluctuated widely. Gold is regarded by some as a hedge against inflation, with its price expected to rise when inflation threatens. On the other hand, gold also is viewed by some as a "safe haven" investment

#### **Real Estate and Other Equity Investments 163**

during uncertain and difficult economic times. There is no consensus regarding the desirability of gold or other precious metals as an investment class.

Individuals can invest in gold by buying coins or perhaps even the bullion itself. They can also buy the common stocks of gold and precious metals mining companies whose share prices presumably move with changes in the prices of the metals themselves. These stocks can be purchased directly or through intermediaries like mutual funds. In addition, there are some ETFs whose assets consist of actual gold and whose share prices move with the price of gold.

### **Art, Antiques, Coins, Stamps, and Other Collectibles**

Some people are interested in investing in more unusual items. In recent years, properly selected items in some areas have shown substantial increases in price. Some of these items are unique and specialized, so buying them successfully requires a knowledge of what one is doing. Also, these items produce no investment income—only possible price appreciation. Of course, many people have a collector's interest in such property anyway, so it may be quite logical for them to acquire these items. When such property is sold at a gain, however, the long-term capital gains tax rate is 28 percent, rather than the 15 percent rate applying currently to most long-term capital gains.
