## **Planning for Taking Distributions from Retirement Plans**

*Competence Objectives for This Chapter* After reading this chapter, planners should understand:

- N Factors affecting planning for retirement plan benefits
- N Federal income taxation of retirement plan benefits
- N Planning for lump-sum distributions
- N Planning for rollovers to an IRA or another qualified plan
- N Penalty taxes on premature distributions and insufficient distributions
- N Required beginning date (RBD) and minimum distribution rules
- N Planning for naming plan beneficiaries and designated beneficiaries
- N Minimum distribution rules after a participant's or owner's death
- N Planning for spousal rollover
- N Planning for nonspousal inherited IRAs
- N Federal estate taxation of retirement plan benefits
- N Planning for taking distributions in various circumstances, such as while in service, on separation from services prior to retirement, at retirement, and at participant's or owner's death
- N How to utilize the "stretch IRA" approach
- N Advantages and limitations of taking retirement benefits as a lifetime annuity income

Chapters 13 and 14 described the various kinds of qualified retirement plans and other plans provided by employers, and Chapter 15 dealt with IRAs. This chapter discusses how and when benefits should be taken from these plans.

A person or a couple may need to plan for taking benefits from these plans in one or more of the following circumstances:

- N While a participant-employee is still employed (i.e., is in service)
- N If a participant separates from an employer's service prior to retirement
- N At retirement
- N At the time of a participant's or IRA owner's death

## **General Considerations Affecting Planning Objectives for Plan Benefits**

These may include the following:

- N Provide a secure lifetime retirement income for the person and his or her spouse (if any) or others
- N Provide capital for investment
- N Accumulate capital on a tax-deferred or tax-free basis for as long as possible in order to pass it on to one's heirs
- N Accumulate capital on a tax-deferred or tax-free basis to allow maximum future flexibility in the use of the funds as retirement income or for estate planning purposes as future conditions may dictate
- N Avoid penalty taxes and reduce other taxes to the greatest extent feasible, consistent with other objectives
- N Keep funds in qualified retirement plans (and perhaps in IRAs) for creditor protection

## **What the Plan Allows**

Persons and their advisers must look to the provisions of their particular plan to determine their rights and benefits under it. In some cases, a participant or IRA owner might want to take a particular action, but if the plan documents do not permit it, that may be that.

## **Available Resources and Need for Income**

If benefits are needed to provide current retirement income, they must be taken in a fashion that will produce adequate income. On the other hand, if there are other substantial resources or income, planning horizons are broader.

## **Health Status**

This may affect planning in several ways. For example, a person in poor health would not want to take retirement benefits as a life annuity if alternatives are available, or might elect an annuity form with substantial survivors benefits.

## **Money Management Considerations**

People vary in the extent to which they want or are able to manage the funds behind their retirement benefits. Some methods of distribution imply active management by the recipient (such as a transfer to a self-directed IRA or a lump-sum distribution), while others do not (such as taking a life annuity). Another aspect of this consideration may be concern over the solvency of financial institutions (funding agencies) holding retirement plan assets. If a person or couple is concerned on this score, they may want to transfer their retirement funds into a rollover IRA with a more secure institution.

## **Income Tax Deferral**

As a general principle, participants and IRA owners want to keep their retirement assets inside a qualified retirement plan or IRA as long as possible to take advantage of the deferral of income taxes (or tax-free growth, in the case of Roth IRAs). This normally makes good tax sense, but it may run counter to other considerations, such as a need for current retirement income.

## **Avoiding Penalty Taxes**

Two penalty taxes may apply to distributions from qualified and other retirement plans or IRAs: a 10 percent tax on premature distributions and a 50 percent tax on insufficient distributions (i.e., that do not conform to the minimum distribution rules). These penalty taxes are described later in this chapter. When considering retirement plan distributions, the 50 percent tax should always be avoided, while the 10 percent tax should be avoided (or reduced) if possible.

## **Meeting Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA) Rules**

As explained in Chapter 13, a married participant in a qualified pension plan must have his or her plan benefits payable in accordance with the REA rules, unless they are waived by the participant with the informed consent of his or her spouse. Furthermore, a married participant in a qualified profit-sharing plan, savings plan, or stock bonus plan must either meet the REA requirements for an exemption or have the benefits payable in accordance with the REA rules, unless waived with the spouse's consent. The REA rules do not apply to IRAs.

## **Estate Planning Considerations**

In some cases, estate planning considerations become quite important in determining how qualified plan and IRA death benefits are to be arranged.

### **Creditor Protection**

Participants and owners of retirement plans may find themselves in bankruptcy or with creditors' claims against them. This is particularly true during difficult economic times such as exist as of this writing. In this case, there are two levels of concern for the debtor. One is whether his or her assets are included in the bankruptcy estate under federal bankruptcy law and the other is whether the assets may be subject to attachment or garnishment under state law.

The federal Bankruptcy Abuse and Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) clarified and expanded in some areas the creditor protection available for retirement plan assets. Qualified retirement plans (such as pension, profit-sharing, 401(k), and stock bonus plans) are completely exempt from creditors' claims under federal and state law. When qualified retirement plan benefits are rolled over to an IRA, BAPCPA provides unlimited creditor protection for the rollover IRA assets in federal bankruptcy proceedings. This federal unlimited exemption also applies to SEP-IRAs and SIMPLE-IRAs.

Under BAPCPA, regular traditional and Roth IRAs (i.e., those created and funded by the owner) are exempt in federal bankruptcy proceedings up to an aggregate limit of \$1,000,000 (unless the bankruptcy judge allows more if "the interests of justice so require"). However, creditor protection for IRAs with respect to state insolvency, attachment, or garnishment actions depends on state law. Many states have enacted laws protecting IRA assets from creditors' claims, but they vary in the extent of such protection.

## **Taxation of Benefits from Qualified Plans and IRAs**

The taxation of benefits from qualified retirement plans and IRAs is a complex subject. Only the general principles will be covered here.

#### **Federal Income Tax on Distributions**

The general principle underlying federal income taxation of payments from qualified retirement plans and traditional IRAs is that, to the extent such payments come from money in the plan that was not previously taxed (i.e., employer contributions, before-tax employee contributions, deductible IRA contributions, and investment earnings on plan assets), the payments should be taxed to the participant (or owner), or to his or her beneficiary, when they are finally paid out from the plan. However, to the extent that payments come from money that has already been taxed (generally after-tax employee contributions and nondeductible IRA contributions), they should be excluded from gross income when finally paid out as benefits. On the other hand, qualified distributions from Roth IRAs are entirely income tax–free.

**Periodic Income from Qualified Plans** Employees frequently take benefits at retirement from death-benefit (DB) pension plans in the form of a periodic lifetime income for themselves or for themselves and their spouses. They sometimes also use their account balances under defined-contribution (DC) plans to similarly provide lifetime incomes or to be paid out in periodic installments of a fixed amount or over a fixed period of years. As a general principle, periodic distributions are subject to the rules governing taxation of annuities (in Section 72 of the IRC). However, special provisions are applicable to qualified retirement plans.

Under the *general annuity rule,* the taxable part of any annuity or installment payment is determined by excluding the part of the payment that is attributable to the employee's own net investment in the plan (cost basis), if any. This is done by calculating an *exclusion ratio* as of the annuity starting date and then multiplying this exclusion ratio by the periodic distribution. This determines the nontaxable or excluded amount. The exclusion ratio is the annuitant's net investment in the plan (cost basis) divided by his or her expected return from the plan.

However, for life annuity and installment payments from qualified retirement plans and TSAs, special rules apply, depending on when annuity payments started or will start. Under the most recent rule, which sometimes is referred to as the *modified simplified general rule,* when the annuity starting date is after December 31, 1997,1 the nontaxable portion of each annuity payment is determined by dividing the annuitant's investment in the contract (if any) by a factor from federal tables that is based only on a single annuitant's age, or on the combined ages if the annuity is payable over two or more lives. For a fixed number of installment payments, the number of monthly payments is used as the divisor.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose Mary Riley is a participant in a DB pension plan to which she has made after-tax contributions of \$32,500 over the years. She is age 65 and her husband is 68. Mary is retiring this year and will receive a joint and 50 percent survivor life annuity for herself and her husband of \$3,000 per month while she is alive and, if her

1Other rules apply in each case when the annuity starting date was after November 18, 1996, but before January 1, 1998, or was after July 1, 1986, but before November 19, 1996, or was on or before July 1, 1986. There have been numerous changes in this area, and these are transition rules. Also, this simplified rule does not apply when the annuitant is age 75 or older on the annuity starting date, unless there are fewer than five years of guaranteed payments.

#### **390 Part V. Retirement Planning and Other Employee Benefits**

husband should survive her, reducing to \$1,500 per month for her husband's remaining lifetime (i.e., a QJSA annuity form). Under these assumptions, Mary can exclude \$125 per month from her pension income. This is determined by dividing her net investment in the contract (\$32,500) by 260 from the federal tables.2 The remainder (\$2,875 per month) will be taxable as ordinary income.

Under the annuity rules (both the general annuity rule and the special rules for qualified plans), an annuitant generally can recover only his or her net investment in the contract tax free. After that, all future payments are fully taxable. Thus, in the previous example, after Mary recovers her \$32,500 basis tax-free, the entire \$3,000 monthly pension will be gross income to her. However, if Mary and her husband should die before the \$32,500 basis is recovered tax-free, the unrecovered amount will be deductible on the final income tax return of the last of them to die.

**Distributions from IRAs** As in the case of qualified plans, traditional IRA owners can recover any investment in the contract (nondeductible contributions) tax-free, while other distributions are taxable as ordinary income. In taxing partial distributions from traditional IRAs, the general annuity rules of Section 72 generally apply. All traditional IRAs owned by a person are treated as one contract for this purpose. Any excludible portion of a distribution is determined by dividing the owner's net investment in the contracts by the expected return from the contracts (the IRA account balances plus certain adjustments), and then multiplying this fraction (if any) by the amount of the distribution. The remainder is gross income. As with qualified plans, an owner can recover tax free only the amount of his or her basis. Qualified distributions from Roth IRAs are income tax–free.

**Net Investment (Basis) in the Plan or Contract** An employee's net investment in a qualified retirement plan may include the following:

- N Any after-tax employee contributions to the plan
- N The total term cost of any pure life insurance protection on the employee's life provided by the plan that had been previously taxed to the employee
- N The amount of any plan loans that were repaid by the employee but had been previously taxed to the employee (e.g., loans that did not meet the requirements for nontaxable plan loans)
- N Any employer contributions that, for some reason, had been previously taxed to the employee

2This is the factor to be used when the combined ages of the annuitants is between 130 and 140; in this case, the ages are 65 + 68 = 133.

Then, from this amount an employee must subtract any nontaxable distributions previously received from the plan and any unrepaid plan loans. The result is the employee's net investment in the plan.

A traditional IRA owner's investment in the contract is any nondeductible contributions.

**Plans Where Participants and Owners Have No Basis** In many cases, participants and traditional IRA owners will have no investment (basis) in the plan or contract. Thus, as a practical matter, distributions from many plans will be taxable as ordinary income.

**Lump-Sum Distributions** Many pension plans and virtually all profitsharing, savings, and stock bonus plans permit participants or their beneficiaries to take their benefits as a lump-sum distribution.

*Definition of a Lump-Sum Distribution:* A *lump-sum distribution* is a distribution made to a participant or his or her beneficiary from a qualified retirement plan of the employee's entire account balance or interest in the plan within one taxable year of the recipient. The distribution must be made because of certain triggering events, which are, the employee attains age 59½; the employee's severance from employment, including retirement; or the employee dies. (For self-employed persons, these triggering events are attaining age 59½, death, or becoming disabled.)

In determining whether there has been a distribution of the entire account balance or interest in the plan, all qualified plans of the same type maintained by the employer for the employee must be considered together as one plan. For this purpose, all pension plans are one type of plan, all profit-sharing plans are another type of plan, and all stock bonus plans are still another type. Thus, for example, suppose an employer maintains a DB pension plan and a savings plan for its employees, and John Jones is covered by both plans. John is retiring. He could decide to receive a life annuity from the pension plan and still take his entire account balance under the savings plan as a lump-sum distribution.

*Taxable Amount of a Lump-Sum Distribution:* To determine the taxable amount of a lump-sum distribution, certain items are subtracted from the total distribution. These items may include:

- N The employee's own after-tax contributions (minus any previous nontaxable distributions).
- N The net unrealized appreciation (NUA) on any employer securities included in the lump-sum distribution (i.e., the difference between the fair market value of the securities at distribution and their cost or other basis to the plan). A number of qualified retirement plans, particularly

#### **392 Part V. Retirement Planning and Other Employee Benefits**

profit-sharing, savings, stock bonus, and employee stock ownership plans, may invest at least part of plan assets in employer securities (e.g., common stock of the employer) and may distribute such securities to employees or their beneficiaries as part of a lump-sum distribution. When this is done, the employee or beneficiary can deduct the amount by which the employer securities have appreciated in value in the hands of the plan;3 however, the income tax basis of the employer securities in the hands of the distributee is their value when they were contributed to or purchased by the plan (a carryover basis).4

- N The term cost of any life insurance protection the employee previously included in his or her income.
- N Repayments of any plan loans that previously were included in the employee's gross income.
- N The actuarial value of any annuity contracts that are included in the lump-sum distribution.

*Decision Factors Concerning Lump-Sum Distributions:* If a participant decides to take a lump-sum distribution, he or she still has to decide whether to pay the income tax currently on the taxable amount (perhaps with some favorable tax features) or to directly transfer (rollover) part or all of the distribution into a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA (with current taxation), or into another qualified plan that will accept such transfers.

Many people opt to defer the tax on the lump sum further through a rollover. This option is discussed later in this chapter. However, there may be circumstances favoring taking a lump-sum distribution and paying tax currently. These might include when the distribution is relatively small, when 10-year forward averaging and capital gain treatment applies under a transition rule for persons who were age 50 or older on January 1, 1986,5 or when a substantial portion of a distribution consists of highly appreciated employer securities (containing NUA). In the case of employer securities with NUA, a partial rollover of plan assets other than employer securities also may be done, as explained later in this chapter. It must be remembered, however, that the 10 percent penalty tax on premature distributions also may apply to taxable lump-sum distributions.

<sup>3</sup>The NUA on employer securities attributable to employer contributions and the earnings on employer and any employee contributions generally is excludible only in the case of a lumpsum distribution. The NUA on employer securities attributable to any employee contributions is excludible from any distribution.

<sup>4</sup>A recipient of employer securities may elect to waive this exclusion of NUA.

<sup>5</sup>There also had been a five-year forward averaging rule available in certain circumstances. However, five-year forward averaging has been repealed for tax years after 1999.

*Options for Taxing Lump-Sum Distributions for Employees Age 50 or Older on January 1, 1986:* These choices include (1) pay tax on the entire taxable amount as ordinary income at current income tax rates, (2) use a one-time 10-year averaging method using 1986 ordinary income tax rates, or (3) pay a flat capital gains tax on the pre-1974 portion of the taxable amount and use 10-year averaging for the remainder.

*Lump-Sum Distributions Containing Employer Securities:* As already explained, the NUA on employer securities in a lump-sum distribution is not taxed currently to the recipient. A participant's basis in the distributed securities is the same as their basis in the plan. Thus, when the participant subsequently sells the securities, the NUA and any subsequent gain or loss is subject to capital gains taxation. The NUA is considered long-term capital gain, while any subsequent gain or loss is either short-term or long-term, depending on how long the participant has held the securities since distribution. Upon a participant's death, the NUA does not get a stepped-up income tax basis. Instead, it is treated as income in respect of a decedent (IRD) to a plan beneficiary, who receives the securities in a lump-sum distribution, or to the recipient of the securities under the participant's will. The IRD is realized and recognized as long-term capital gain when the securities are sold by the beneficiary or heir.

Thus, the advantages of taking employer securities in a lump-sum distribution are that the tax on the NUA is deferred until the securities are finally sold (either by the participant or his or her heirs) and that the NUA is converted from ordinary income to a long-term capital gain. But the price for these advantages is that some tax, at ordinary income rates, must be paid immediately on part of the distribution.

Whether a lump-sum distribution or, alternatively, a direct transfer (rollover) to a traditional IRA is best depends on the circumstances. The factors determining which will provide the greatest after-tax results are as follows:

- N The proportion of employer securities in the distribution
- N The extent of NUA
- N Taxable assets in the distribution and whether a partial rollover of assets other than the employer securities is done
- N How and at what after-tax rate of return the securities and possibly the other assets will be invested once they are outside the plan
- N The after-tax opportunity cost for tax currently paid
- N An assumption about how long the employer securities will be held before they are sold and the capital gains tax rate at sale
- N The period of deferral for the traditional IRA
- N Whether any of the plan benefits are placed in a Roth IRA
- N Whether the 10 percent tax on premature distributions will apply to the taxable part of the lump-sum distribution

#### **394 Part V. Retirement Planning and Other Employee Benefits**

This clearly is a complex analysis. Advisers may use computer programs to help in this decision.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that Mary Johnson, age 60, has been employed by a rapidly growing corporation, the XYZ Company, for many years. She is a participant in the company's savings plan with a Section 401(k) option. Her total account balance in the plan is \$685,000 and she has no investment (basis) in the plan. All of her employer's matching contributions have been invested in XYZ common stock (employer securities). Mary's elective contributions have been divided equally between XYZ stock and a bond fund. XYZ stock is publicly traded and has grown rapidly in value over the years. The current value of XYZ stock in Mary's account balance is \$575,000 and it has a total basis to the plan (purchase price by the plan or value when contributed to the plan) of \$120,000. The other \$110,000 is in the bond fund.

Mary is retiring this year. If she takes a lump-sum distribution of the entire account balance in the savings plan (the only profitsharing type plan provided by XYZ) and is in the 35 percent tax bracket, her potential taxable amount on the distribution will be as follows:

| Total Lump-Sum Distribution           | \$685,000 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| Minus:                                |           |
| Employee's investment (basis) in plan | 0         |
| NUA on employer securities            |           |
| (\$575,000 – \$120,000)               | –455,000  |
| Potential taxable amount              | \$230,000 |

Assume Mary plans to rollover the potentially taxable amount of the distribution that is not in employer securities (i.e., the \$110,000 in the bond fund) to her own traditional IRA and further defer the tax on this amount (a partial rollover). Thus, she must pay tax as ordinary income only on \$120,000 (which is the basis of the XYZ stock to the plan). She plans to take this tax from other non-tax-advantaged assets. Thus, when the dust clears, Mary will have \$575,000 of directly owned XYZ stock, with an income tax basis to her of \$120,000 (the plan's basis on which she paid tax) and a traditional IRA with a \$110,000 account balance. She will have paid \$42,000 in tax (\$120,000 r 0.35) from other assets. The XYZ stock may, of course, either increase or decrease in value. Mary may sell or otherwise dispose of the stock during her lifetime or hold it until her death and pass it to her heirs by will. At death, however, the NUA does not get a step-up in basis.

Alternatively, Mary could rollover the \$685,000 account balance to a traditional IRA with no current tax liability. She then could withdraw from the IRA as she needs funds or continue to defer until her RBD (age 70½). However, all distributions from the IRA will be taxed as ordinary income. Mary might also rollover part or all of the account balance directly to a Roth IRA and pay tax on the amount rolled over.

**Direct Transfers or 60-Day Rollovers to an IRA or Another Qualified Plan** This may be done by either having the participant's employer transfer directly all or part of an eligible rollover distribution to a traditional IRA (or Roth IRA with current taxation) or to another qualified retirement plan (or TSA) that will accept such transfers; or having the distribution paid to the participating employee, who then rolls over all or part of the distribution to an IRA or to another qualified plan (or TSA) within 60 days of receipt of the distribution.

For this purpose, an *eligible rollover distribution* is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the employee in a qualified retirement plan (or tax-sheltered annuity); except that it does not include distributions made as substantially equal periodic payments over the lifetime (or life expectancy) of the employee or the lifetimes (or life expectancies) of the employee and his or her designated beneficiary, or distributions for a specified period of 10 years or more, or distributions required to satisfy the minimum distribution rules. Direct transfers and rollovers can be made regardless of an employee's age, are available for any number of eligible distributions, and are not subject to any dollar limit on the amount that can be transferred or rolled over. There also is no triggering-event requirement. Any part or all of an employee's balance in the plan can be an eligible rollover distribution. The entire amount of an eligible distribution may be transferred to a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA (subject to current taxation), or a qualified plan or TSA, or qualified plan, including any employee after-tax contributions, if the qualified plan agrees to separately track the after-tax contributions and their earnings.

To the extent that an otherwise taxable distribution is directly transferred or rolled over, it is not currently taxable (except to rollovers to a Roth IRA) and will be taxed only when paid out to the employee or his or her beneficiary from the traditional IRA or other plan. However, there is a mandatory 20 percent income tax withholding requirement applicable to eligible rollover distributions, except when the distributee elects to have the distribution directly transferred. Thus, a 60-day rollover is subject to mandatory 20 percent withholding, while a direct transfer is not. This distinction strongly favors direct transfers over 60-day rollovers.

In the event a surviving spouse of a deceased participant in a qualified retirement plan, 403(b), or other eligible plan receives an eligible rollover distribution from the plan, as beneficiary, the spouse also may directly transfer or roll the distribution over to the spouse's own IRA or to another qualified retirement plan, TSA, or Section 457 plan in which the spouse participates. Aside from a surviving spouse, no other beneficiary of the plan's death benefits can avail themselves of this rollover treatment.

However, PPA of 2006 provided a different, but important, rollover provision for nonspouse beneficiaries of deceased participants in qualified plans, TSAs, and Section 457 plans. These beneficiaries (including the trustees of trusts named as plan beneficiaries for the benefit of nonspouse beneficiaries) can directly transfer (a trustee-to-trustee transfer) the plan's death benefits to an IRA established by the beneficiary to receive them on behalf of the nonspouse beneficiary. This IRA is in the deceased participant's name but is for the benefit of the nonspouse beneficiary (an inherited IRA). Thus, the nonspouse beneficiary does not own this IRA in the same way that a surviving spouse does in the case of a spousal rollover. However, once the plan's death benefit is in the inherited IRA account, the IRA custodian or trustee will allow the distribution to be paid out over the life expectancy of the non-spouse beneficiary or the remaining life expectancy of the decedent under the minimum distribution rules explained later in this chapter.

**Penalty Tax on Premature Distributions** In an effort to discourage withdrawals from tax-advantaged retirement plans prior to retirement, the tax law imposes an additional 10 percent excise tax on the taxable portion of distributions from such plans made prior to age 59½, subject to certain exceptions. This 10 percent penalty tax is in addition to the regular income tax paid.

For qualified retirement plans, aside from reaching age 59½, the other exceptions to the imposition of this tax include:

- N Distributions made on or after the employee's death
- N Distributions due to an employee's disability
- N Payments made as substantially equal periodic benefits for the lifetime or life expectancy of the employee (or for the joint lives or expectancies of the employee and his or her beneficiary)
- N Distributions to an employee after attaining age 55 upon separation from service

- N Distributions to an employee for deductible medical expenses
- N Distributions to persons (alternate payees) under QDROs
- N Certain other distributions

This 10 percent tax applies to qualified retirement plans, TSA plans, and IRAs. Note that the exceptions for IRAs are somewhat different from those just outlined. TSAs also have some differences in their exceptions.

**Required Beginning Date (RBD) and Minimum Distribution Rules** The tax law requires that persons participating in qualified retirement plans, traditional IRAs, TSAs, and Section 457 plans must meet certain minimum distribution rules. There are three elements in determining the minimum amounts that must be distributed: the required beginning date, the amount of the IRA owner's or plan participant's benefit in the plan as of the valuation date, and the minimum required distribution periods (or divisors) for employees' or owners' ages according to the IRS's Uniform Lifetime Table. There also are special rules when an owner's or participant's spouse is the plan beneficiary. It is important to comply with these rules, because there is a 50 percent penalty tax on the difference between what was actually distributed in a given year and what should have been distributed under the minimum distribution rules. This is called the *penalty tax on insufficient distributions.*

*Required Beginning Date (RBD):* Distributions from qualified retirement plans to participants generally must begin by either April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the person attains age 70½ or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the person retires (but this retirement date applies only if the participant is not more than a 5 percent owner of the sponsoring employer), whichever is later. Distributions from traditional IRAs to owners must begin no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the owner attains age 70½.

*Distributions Before the RBD:* Before the RBD, distributions can or cannot be taken at the discretion of the participant or IRA owner.

*Benefit Amount and Valuation Date:* For *qualified individual account plans* (e.g., profit-sharing plans and 401(k) plans), the benefit for calculating the minimum distribution is the plan's account balance as of the plan's last valuation date in the calendar year preceding the calendar year of the distribution (with certain adjustments). For *traditional IRAs*, the benefit amount is the plan's account balance on December 31 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year of the distribution.

*Minimum Distribution Rules for Distributions at and After the RBD and Before Death:* Once an IRA owner or plan participant reaches the RBD, he or she must begin taking a minimum distribution each year from the plans just noted.6

The minimum amount that must be distributed from a plan (whose benefits are not paid as a life annuity) for the first required distribution year is determined by dividing the owner's or participant's benefit in the plan by the distribution period (or applicable divisor) from the Uniform Lifetime Table for the owner's or participant's age at the end of each distribution year. For example, this period (divisor) is 27.4 for age 70 and 26.5 for age 71.7 This is referred to as *recalculation*. It is used for the participant or owner of a plan and a surviving spouse as direct beneficiary. Its importance lies in the fact that while the divisor declines each year as the person gets older, it does not decline by one full year. Thus, there is always some divisor and so the plan balance is never completely exhausted. This slows distributions and enhances deferral.

For years after the first distribution year, the minimum distribution is determined by dividing the owner's or participant's benefit in the plan, as of the prior year, by the applicable period (divisor) for the owner's or participant's age at the end of the current year. A distribution period is given in the IRS Uniform Lifetime Table for each age up to 115 and over.8 These periods gradually diminish with age. For example, the period for age 75 is 22.9 and for age 85 is 14.8. Aside from the exception to be noted next, the periods (divisors) to be used for minimum distribution calculations during the IRA owner's or plan participant's lifetime are not affected by the plan's

<sup>6</sup>As of this writing, the minimum distribution requirements have been suspended for 2009 as part of the government's economic stimulus program.

<sup>7</sup>As just noted, the first distribution must be made by April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the IRA owner or retired qualified plan participant becomes age 70½ (the RBD). Then, distributions must be made by December 31 for each year after the 70½ year. This means there will be a doubling up of distributions in the calendar year following the 70½ year if the participant delays taking his or her first distribution until the year (by April 1) following the 70½ year. For example, assume that Howard Schwartz became age 70 on February 2, 2006, and is the owner of a traditional IRA. If he takes his first distribution on April 1, 2007 (for the first required distribution year of 2006), he also must take a distribution by December 31, 2007 (for 2007). Then, at a minimum, he must take a distribution by December 31 of each succeeding year. This may require some planning because such doubling up of distributions and hence taxable income in the calendar year following the 70½ year may be undesirable in some cases due to higher income tax rates and taxes. Thus, in these cases, it may be better income tax–wise to take the first required distribution in the 70½ year and spread the taxable income more. This decision depends on the person's circumstances, tax rates, and expected income in the two years.

<sup>8</sup>This "Uniform Lifetime Table" is based on joint life expectancies (on a gender neutral basis) starting at age 70 for an employee or owner and a hypothetical individual beneficiary who is 10 years younger than the employee or owner.

beneficiary designation. On the other hand, after an IRA owner's or plan participant's death, the minimum required distributions of any remaining account balances are determined by the beneficiary designation.

The exception just noted is when the owner or participant names his or her spouse, who is *more than* 10 years younger than the owner or participant, as the sole primary plan beneficiary. In this case, their actual joint life expectancies each year can be used to calculate the minimum required distributions as long as both are alive. This will produce lower required minimum distributions than the IRS Uniform Table.

*Defined-Benefit Plans and the Minimum Distribution Rules:* For *defined-benefit plans* with their benefits payable as a *life income*, the minimum distribution rules will be met by level payments made at least annually, commencing on or before the RBD, over the life of the participant or the joint and survivor lives of the participant and his or her spouse as designated beneficiary.9

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

It may be helpful at this point to illustrate these rules with a common situation. Suppose Martin and Sara Wilson are married, and Martin retired eight years ago when he was age 62 and Sara was age 57. Sara is a self-employed consulting engineer, and Martin had been an executive for a large corporation. Since Martin retired, they have had more-than-adequate income from Social Security, a joint and 50 percent to the survivor life income from Martin's defined-benefit pension plan, current returns from their investment portfolios, and consulting work that Sara still does. Martin also was a participant in a qualified savings plan with a Section 401(k) option (in which he has no cost basis), with an account balance at his retirement of \$280,000. Sara and Martin have one son and three grandchildren to whom they would like to leave as much of their assets as possible after their deaths.

At his retirement, Martin rolled over the entire \$280,000 savings plan balance to a traditional IRA and named Sara as designated beneficiary.10 The IRA has had an average annual total rate

10Note that, unlike the situation for the qualified savings plan, the REA does not apply to an IRA; therefore, Martin could name anyone he wishes as beneficiary of his IRA. In this situation, however, he decided to name his spouse. This has many advantages for both qualified plans and IRAs. However, it also means the spouse will have complete control over the funds after the owner's (Martin's) death. This is something to consider in planning. Its importance depends on the circumstances (state of the marriage, children from prior marriages, and so forth).

<sup>9</sup> If the designated beneficiary is someone other than the spouse, certain minimum distribution incidental death benefit (MDIB) rules must be met. There also are special rules for periodcertain guarantees.

of return of about 8 percent per year over the last eight years. The account balance as of December 31, 2005 (the valuation date), was \$518,260 (we will round down to \$518,000 for this example).

Martin turned 70 on February 1, 2006, and Sara was age 65 on March 5, 2006. Martin's RBD is April 1, 2007, and his first required distribution year (70½ year) is 2006. The first required minimum distribution for 2006 would be determined by dividing the IRA account balance as of the valuation date (December 31 of the preceding year) of \$518,000 by the Uniform Table divisor for age 70 (Martin's age at the end of 2006), which is 27.4. Note that Sara's age does not affect the divisor because she is not more than 10 years younger than Martin.11 Thus, the minimum distribution for 2006 is \$18,905 (\$518,000 ÷ 27.4) and the account balance on December 31, 2006 (assuming an 8 percent total return for all of 2006), would be \$540,535 (\$518,000 + \$41,440 investment return – \$18,905 minimum distribution). The minimum distribution for the next year (2007) would be \$20,398 (\$540,535 ÷ 26.5) and the account balance on December 31, 2007, would be \$563,380 (\$540,535 + \$43,243 investment return – \$20,398 minimum distribution).12

This procedure will continue over Martin's lifetime. Computer programs are available to show this under various assumptions. Financial institutions (e.g., the custodian for Martin's IRA) normally will perform these calculations for their customers. Depending on investment yields, the value of the account normally will continue to grow for a number of years after the RBD, until it begins to decline because of the constantly declining divisors and hence increasing minimum distributions required.

*Designated Beneficiaries:* A *designated beneficiary* is any identifiable individual designated by a participant or owner to receive any remaining plan benefits after the participant's or owner's death. The beneficiary may be any person or persons. But if a participant is married and names anyone other than his or her spouse, the proper waiver and spousal consent requirements of REA must be observed if REA applies to the plan.

<sup>11</sup>But if we were to change the facts and say that Sara is age 50 in 2006, then the divisor would be based on their actual joint life expectancies each year from the IRS Joint and Last Survivor Table. This divisor for a person age 70 and another person age 50 is 35.1. This divisor would be recalculated each year Martin and Sara are alive.

<sup>12</sup>Under the minimum distribution rules, Martin could defer taking the first distribution until April 1, 2007, but for the reasons given in Footnote 6, let us assume he takes his minimum distribution for each year as of December 31 of that year.

If a participant or owner designates *multiple beneficiaries*, the person with the shortest life expectancy is considered the designated beneficiary. A participant or owner also can name a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries by an identifiable status or class, such as children of the participant, provided the beneficiary or beneficiaries themselves are identifiable.

Because of the rules concerning multiple beneficiaries, a useful planning technique when there are to be several beneficiaries of an IRA is to request the IRA custodian or trustee to divide the IRA account into subaccounts or sub-IRAs (within the original IRA), with one subaccount for each beneficiary. Then each beneficiary is the designated beneficiary of his or her subaccount, and his or her own life expectancy will govern minimum distributions. This planning approach is discussed later in the chapter.

A trust can be named as beneficiary to receive any remaining plan benefits after a participant's or owner's death. In that event, the individuals who are beneficiaries of the trust can be considered as designated beneficiaries for purposes of the minimum distribution rules, provided the trust meets certain requirements. These are called *see-through trusts* and:

- N They must be valid under applicable state law.
- N They must be irrevocable, or by their terms will become irrevocable at the participant's or owner's death.
- N The trust beneficiaries must be individuals and be identifiable from the trust instrument.
- N A copy of the trust instrument must be provided to the plan administrator or IRA custodian, or a list of beneficiaries with a description of the conditions of their entitlement must be provided.

Another kind of trust where the individual trust beneficiaries can be considered designated beneficiaries is called a *conduit trust*. A conduit trust is the same as a see-through trust except that the trustee must distribute to an individual trust beneficiary any distribution the trustee receives from the retirement plan. This means the trustee cannot accumulate plan distributions in the trust as is possible for a see-through trust.

The significance of being a "designated beneficiary" is that the life expectancy of a designated beneficiary, whether named directly or as a beneficiary of a see-through trust, may be used to determine the required minimum distributions after a participant's or owner's death. The rules regarding minimum distributions after death are discussed in the next section.

There can be plan beneficiaries who are not "designated beneficiaries," such as charities, a trust that is not a see-through trust, or the participant's or owner's estate. In this case, no life expectancy is used and any remaining account balance must be paid out within five years after the year of the participant's or owner's death (the "five-year rule"). Furthermore, if there are multiple beneficiaries and some are designated beneficiaries but one or more are not, then none will be considered designated beneficiaries. For example, if an IRA owner with a \$1,300,000 account balance names a charity as a beneficiary to receive \$100,000 and names her three children as equal beneficiaries to receive the balance, since the charity is not a designated beneficiary (even though the children are), at the owner's death none will be considered designated beneficiaries and the five-year rule will apply.

However, a helpful rule is that the identity of a designated beneficiary does not need to be finally determined until September 30 of the calendar year following the year in which the participant or owner dies. The importance of this is that planning actions can be taken after the owner's or participant's death and before this September 30 date) to produce the most appropriate designated beneficiary or beneficiaries for tax-deferral purposes. Such actions may include disclaimers by one or more beneficiaries (disclaimers are covered in Chapter 26); total distributions ("cash-outs") to some beneficiaries (such as charities); and account divisions in the case of multiple individual designated beneficiaries. For example, in the case situation in the previous paragraph, the \$100,000 could be paid to the charity before the September 30 date (i.e., it could be "cashed out"). Then, on the September 30 date there would be only individual designated beneficiaries and their life expectancies could be used for minimum distribution planning.

However, this does not mean that, for example, a deceased owner's or participant's executor can name one or more new designated beneficiaries after the owner's or participant's death. The owner or participant should name the beneficiary or beneficiaries he or she wants prior to his or her death. It is just that these planning actions can deal with an existing beneficiary designation.

*Minimum Distribution Rules After an Owner's or Participant's Death Before the RBD:* In this event, the required minimum distributions depend on whether a surviving spouse is the sole primary designated beneficiary (either directly or as the sole designated beneficiary of a trust),13 an individual other than the spouse is the designated beneficiary, or there is no designated beneficiary (e.g., a charity or the decedent's estate is named as beneficiary).

When a *surviving spouse* is sole primary designated beneficiary, the required minimum distributions may begin either by December 31 of the calendar year following the year of the owner's or participant's death, or by

<sup>13</sup>A spouse is the sole designated beneficiary of a trust when he or she can withdraw all distributions to the trust from the IRA or plan.

December 31 of the year in which the decedent would have reached age 70½, whichever is later. The decedent's interest in the plan or IRA may be paid out in annual amounts over the life expectancy of the spouse, determined each year from the Uniform Lifetime Table with recalculation. Upon the spouse's subsequent death, any remaining balance may be paid out in annual amounts to the spouse's estate or to a subsequent designated beneficiary over the deceased spouse's life expectancy as of the date of his or her death and subtracting one year for each year thereafter.

When *someone other than the spouse* is the designated beneficiary (children, for example), the required minimum distributions must begin no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the owner's or participant's death. Then, the decedent's interest in the plan or IRA may be paid out in annual amounts over the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary as of the year after the owner's or participant's death using the Single Life Table and subtracting one year for each year thereafter.

The rules just stated for spousal designated beneficiaries and nonspousal designated beneficiaries involve the *life expectancy distribution option.* This option requires minimum annual distributions over a beneficiary's life expectancy (i.e., the account balance at the end of the previous year divided by the life expectancy number for the distribution year). This can be a relatively long time and result in considerable income tax deferral. For example, under the IRS Single Life Table, life expectancies are 43.6 years for age 40, 34.2 years for age 50, and 25.2 years for age 60.

On the other hand, when the beneficiary is *not a designated beneficiary*, a different rule applies. In this case, the decedent's entire interest in the plan must be distributed to the beneficiary by the end of the fifth year following the year of death. This is known as the *five-year rule.* It clearly provides much less opportunity for tax deferral than the life expectancy option.

*Minimum Distribution Rules After an Owner's or Participant's Death After the RBD:* These are similar to the rules just described, but with some differences. When a *surviving spouse* is the sole primary designated beneficiary, the required minimum distributions must begin by December 31 of the calendar year following the year of the owner's or participant's death. The decedent's remaining interest in the plan or IRA then may be paid out in annual amounts over the spouse's life expectancy, determined each year from the Uniform Lifetime Table with recalculation. Upon the spouse's death, the treatment is the same as described previously for death before the RBD.

When *someone other than the spouse* is the designated beneficiary, minimum distributions must begin by December 31 of the calendar year following the year of the owner's or participant's death, and the plan balance may be paid out in annual amounts over the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary as of the year after the owner's or participant's death using the Single Life Table and subtracting one year for each year thereafter.

When the beneficiary is not classified as a designated beneficiary, distributions must begin by December 31 of the year following the year of death. But in this case, the plan balance may be paid out in annual amounts over the life expectancy of someone the age of the deceased owner or participant as of the year of the owner's or participant's death using the Single Life Table and subtracting one year for each year thereafter.

With regard to the previously discussed minimum distribution rules, it should be noted that an IRA agreement or the provisions of a qualified plan can specify whether the five-year rule or the life expectancy option is to apply, or the plan terms can permit either the participant or owner, or the beneficiary, to choose which rule applies. As a practiced matter, qualified retirement plans usually require that the decedent's plan balance be paid out to the beneficiary immediately or within the five-year rule allowing little or no deferral. IRA agreements, on the other hand, normally allow the life expectancy option. Therefore, if a participant in a qualified plan dies and deferral is desired for the designated beneficiary (as it usually is), it is desirable to roll the decedent's account balance over into an IRA for the beneficiary. This could always be done if the designated beneficiary were the participant-decedent's surviving spouse who could roll the account balance over into his or her own IRA. Fortunately, PPA of 2006 now also allows a nonspouse designated beneficiary to directly transfer the qualified plan account balance to an inherited IRA for the beneficiary and thus be able to utilize the beneficiary's life expectancy.

A designated beneficiary can be named directly or indirectly as an identifiable beneficiary of a see-through trust meeting the requirements noted earlier. If a trust does not meet these requirements, the five-year rule or the owner or participant age life expectancy rule applies. But if a trust for the spouse is named as beneficiary (even if the spouse is designated beneficiary of the trust), the spouse in most cases cannot transfer (roll over) plan benefits to his or her own IRA or treat an IRA as his or her own, as a surviving spouse could if named as the individual designated beneficiary.

*Rollover Option for Surviving Spouse Only:* When a surviving spouse is the sole primary designated beneficiary of a qualified plan or IRA, an alternative to taking distributions under the rules just described is to rollover the account balance to the spouse's own traditional IRA or to treat the decedent's IRA as the spouse's IRA. In this case, the minimum distribution rules apply to the IRA as the spouse's own IRA and hence distributions would not have to begin until the spouse's own RBD (spouse's age 70½). This may be an attractive alternative, particularly if the spouse is younger than the participant. The spouse also could convert or rollover to a Roth IRA (if eligible) and then delay distributions from the Roth IRA until the spouse's death.

Then, we assume that the spouse names, for example, a child or children as the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of the spouse's IRA (either traditional or Roth), the IRA balance could be paid annually over the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries (the children) using the Single Life Table and subtracting one year for each year thereafter after the spouse's death. This could allow a long period of tax deferral or tax-free growth. This is the concept of the "stretch IRA."

Also, if the designated beneficiary of an IRA is the spouse of a deceased owner, the surviving spouse may elect to assume the IRA and treat it as if it were his or her own, or roll it over into another IRA as if the surviving spouse had originally established it. In either event, the minimum distribution rules for IRAs would apply just as for the spouse's own IRA. Thus, the RBD for a traditional IRA would be the surviving spouse's age 70½. Distributions from a Roth IRA would not have to start until the surviving spouse's death and then would be payable to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, as just noted.

*Rollover (Direct Transfer) Option for Nonspouse Beneficiaries:* As already explained, PPA of 2006 now allows a nonspouse designated beneficiary to directly transfer the account balance of a deceased participant in a qualified retirement plan, TSA, or Section 457 plan to an inherited IRA for the beneficiary. A nonspouse beneficiary of a deceased IRA owner's IRA can also treat it as an inherited IRA.

#### **Federal Estate Taxation**

The full value of any death benefits payable under a qualified retirement plan, TSA, traditional or Roth IRA, or similar plan are includible in the decedent's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. To the extent that such death benefits are payable to a decedent's surviving spouse (either directly or through a qualifying trust), they will qualify for the marital deduction and be deductible from the gross estate in arriving at the taxable estate. (See Chapter 26.)

Married persons with estates large enough to need federal estate tax planning may want to have qualified plan and IRA death benefits qualify for the marital deduction. It can be argued that these often are good kinds of property interests to qualify because they generally are *wasting assets.* That is*,* they are burdened with an inherent income tax liability at the time of any distribution (except for Roth IRAs) to the surviving spouse, which will further reduce the surviving spouse's own estate at his or her subsequent death. This planning idea really is true of any IRD item in the gross estate.

There are several ways these death benefits can be made to qualify for the marital deduction, including by being payable:

- N In a lump sum to the surviving spouse as beneficiary14
- N As a joint life and last survivor annuity for the participant and his or her spouse if no person other than the participant and his or her spouse can receive any payments prior to the death of the last spouse to die
- N To a trust that will qualify for the marital deduction

The planning issues involving these methods are discussed in the final section of this chapter.

## **Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Taxation**

In some cases, a GST tax might apply to qualified plan or IRA death benefits. The GST tax is described more fully in Chapter 26.

## **Planning for Distributions from Qualified Retirement Plans and IRAs**

Planning for these benefits is an extensive subject. Only the salient issues are presented here. In doing so, we have divided the issues into those applying while a participant (or owner) is still in service, at separation from service before retirement (as when the person changes jobs or is laid off), at retirement, and at death.

## **While in Service**

Plan participants may face several issues while in service. Some of these have already been discussed. With regard to getting cash from qualified plans while still in service, the choices may be:

- N Use of plan loans.
- N Possible in-service withdrawals. While such withdrawals may be permitted in some cases, they have lost much of their attraction.

14Another approach to this issue is to name the spouse as beneficiary and then, after the participant's or owner's death, the spouse at his or her option can *disclaim* (meeting the tax requirements for a valid disclaimer) part or all of the plan benefits, with those benefits then going into a nonmarital trust or other trust. This, in effect, allows the surviving spouse to fund a nonmarital trust or gift if he or she wishes to do so for estate planning reasons. This approach may be particularly useful after EGTRRA.

## **At Separation from Service Prior to Retirement**

With regard to vested qualified plan benefits, the choices may be as follows:

- N Leave vested benefits in the former employer's plan if permitted. However, the person's rights to the benefits then will depend on the plan's terms.
- N Take a lump-sum distribution. This will be discussed more fully in the next section.
- N Elect a direct transfer to an IRA, to a new employer's qualified plan (if that plan accepts such transfers), or to another eligible plan. This also is covered more fully in the next section.

## **At Retirement**

Again, many planning issues face the former employee (and his or her spouse, if any). With regard to qualified plan and IRA benefits at retirement, there may be the choices discussed in the following sections.

**Receiving Periodic Annuity Income (and What Annuity Form to Select)** Some plans contemplate the taking of retirement benefits as a life annuity or a joint life and last survivor annuity. There are two basic planning issues in this area: whether to take benefits as a life income or as a lump sum (if available) and if a life income is desired, selecting the annuity form.

#### *Advantages of Lifetime Annuity Income:*

- N Security of income for life. This is one of the basic purposes of a pension plan. Also, if a joint life and last survivor annuity form is chosen, a lifetime income can be guaranteed for the retiring employee or IRA owner and his or her spouse. It gives them an income they cannot outlive.
- N The retiree may be able to secure relatively generous life annuity rates from a pension plan or perhaps even under a defined-contribution plan. On the other hand, the reverse also may be true. This factor simply must be evaluated in each case based on the annuity income from the plan compared with what can be received or earned on a lump sum outside the plan after taxes.
- N For married retirees, this is the form of pension plan benefit mandated by the REA (a QJSA), unless the employee waives it and his or her spouse consents in the proper form.
- N Some employers may make voluntary increases for inflation in lifetime pension benefits. If benefits are taken as a lump sum, such adjustments will be lost in the future.

- N The retiree may need the largest available current income to make retirement financially feasible.
- N The retiree and his or her spouse are relieved of the need to make investment decisions concerning lump-sum distributions.

*Limitations of Lifetime Annuity Income:* On the other hand, there may be disadvantages of a life annuity.

- N The *annuity risk* or *mortality risk* is perhaps the most important, since there is a loss of capital at the retired employee's or spouse's death. Therefore, a person or couple, in making this decision, might want to evaluate what kind of after-tax investment yield they can conservatively secure on the capital that would result from any available lump-sum distribution. Alternatively, they might evaluate the return while they are alive and what would remain for their beneficiaries after their deaths from a rollover IRA.
- N Loss of flexibility (investment, withdrawal, etc.) inherent in taking a lifetime annuity income.
- N Loss of possible tax advantages of a lump-sum distribution, particularly if the distribution contains appreciated employer securities (NUA).
- N The retiree and his or her spouse will be dependent on the financial soundness of the funding agency (a pension trust or life insurance company) for a long time. On the other hand, with their own investments (from a lump-sum distribution) or their own IRA (from a rollover IRA), they can change investments or financial intermediaries quite easily. They may also be able to convert a rollover traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. However, the PBGC does cover defined-benefit pension income from insolvent plans up to a limit.
- N A life annuity is not a good choice if the retiree is in poor health.

*Deciding What Annuity Form to Use:* Assuming a retiring employee and his or her spouse, if married, have decided to take some or all of their retirement benefits as a life annuity (or in installments), they now must decide what kind of annuity among those offered by the plan to use. This is known as selecting the *annuity form.* The following are various kinds of annuity forms that could be available under qualified retirement plans. They are described more fully in Chapters 17 and 21.

- N Single (or straight) life annuity.
- N Joint life annuity with a 50 percent survivor's benefit to the second annuitant. This is the minimum QJSA form described previously.
- N Other joint life and last survivor annuity forms.
- N Life annuities with various refund features.
- N Payments for a fixed period or in a fixed amount.

An important planning issue in selecting the annuity form is how much, if any, benefit is to be provided for a survivor. A factor in this decision is how much, if any, a straight life annuity will be reduced for the QJSA (or other survivorship) protection for a surviving spouse. This actuarial reduction, if any, varies among plans, but is normally less when the parties are younger. The following are some sample reduction factors for one corporate pension plan.

| Ages at Retirement |        | Percentage by Which Single Life Annuity |
|--------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| Plan Participant   | Spouse | Will Be Reduced for QJSA Form           |
| 55                 | 55     | 7.5%                                    |
| 60                 | 60     | 9.0%                                    |
| 65                 | 65     | 10.7%                                   |

In general, unless there are other resources or existing life insurance to protect a surviving spouse, it probably is logical to accept the QJSA form or even to use a larger survivor's percentage to protect a surviving spouse if a life annuity is being taken. Of course, if a QJSA form is subsidized by a particular employer, there really is no choice.

**Taking a Lump-Sum Distribution and Paying Some Tax Currently** Following are some of the reasons to take this approach:

- N The main reason would be if there is favorable income tax treatment, such as NUA on employer securities (as illustrated earlier) and possible transitional tax rules.
- N After the distribution, the participant gains complete investment and other control over the funds (after taxes).
- N The participant and his or her spouse may feel that income tax rates are relatively low currently, compared to what they might be in the future. However, this kind of guesstimate can be uncertain.
- N In some cases, defined-benefit pension plans may offer relatively liberal lump-sum options.
- N It may be convenient to take smaller benefits as a lump-sum distribution.

#### **Making a Direct Transfer to a Rollover IRA** Such transfers to an IRA can be quite advantageous.

- N There is no current income tax for traditional IRAs.
- N The investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains on the amount transferred continue to accumulate income tax–deferred or –free.
- N The IRA owner generally can decide when to take money from the IRA. However, the owner must comply with the minimum distribution rules.

#### **410 Part V. Retirement Planning and Other Employee Benefits**

- N A traditional IRA owner (or his or her surviving spouse) can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA over time (i.e., to spread out the tax payments).
- N The owner has control over the IRA and, if the owner chooses, can direct its investments over a broad range of investment instruments. Furthermore, if the owner wishes a life annuity, he or she can place originally, transfer, or roll over the IRA to a life insurance company individual retirement annuity.
- N A surviving spouse as beneficiary can assume the IRA and treat it as his or her own with no current income taxation.
- N The REA rules do not apply to IRAs. Therefore, from the viewpoint of the plan participant, to the extent the REA rules may cause estate planning complications, being free of them may be an advantage. On the other hand, from the viewpoint of the participant's spouse, the reverse may be true, and REA protection may be lost. In reality, this may or may not be a controversial issue, depending on the circumstances.
- N A rollover now can also be made from a qualified plan or TSA directly to a Roth IRA.
- N In some cases, defined-benefit pension plans may offer relatively liberal rollover eligible distributions.

**Leaving Benefits in a Former Employer's Plan** This may be done if the plan's terms permit it. It may be attractive if the plan has especially favorable investment options or other features. Depending on state law, there also may be more favorable creditor protection for assets in a qualified plan than in an IRA. On the other hand, the terms of the plan will continue to apply to the retiree's account, and the REA rules will apply.

**General Considerations on Taking Plan Benefits at Retirement** Unfortunately, there are no pat answers for this important decision. It depends largely on the facts and circumstances of each case. However, the following general principles may be helpful:

- N With respect to many retirees, it probably is wise to provide at least a base level of guaranteed lifetime income for the person or couple.
- N If the special tax advantages of a lump-sum distribution (e.g., a large amount of highly appreciated employer securities with substantial NUA) are especially significant in a particular case, the participant might consider taking a lump-sum distribution and paying some tax currently.
- N If a retiree wants flexibility, control, and yet continued income tax deferral, often little would seem to be lost by transferring to a rollover traditional IRA and then making withdrawal or conversion decisions later.

- N If a traditional IRA owner wants long-term tax-free deferral and wealth growth for himself or herself, or his or her heirs, a conversion or direct rollover to a Roth IRA should be considered, provided the owner can afford (or can finance) the tax on conversion or rollover.
- N There may well be merit in following a diversified approach to taking retirement plan benefits. For example, a person or couple may take a lifetime retirement income from a defined-benefit pension plan and then directly transfer the account balance from a defined-contribution plan to an IRA.

## **Death Benefits Under Qualified Plans and IRAs**

**Kinds of Death Benefits** There may be significant death benefits prior to retirement as well as after retirement.

Preretirement death benefits may include:

- N QPSA (under REA)
- N Account balances under DC plans and IRAs
- N Incidental life insurance as part of a qualified plan

Postretirement death benefits may include:

- N QJSA (under REA) or other survivors' benefits
- N Any remaining account balances under DC plans and IRAs

**Strategies for Naming Beneficiaries of Death Benefits** This choice really is part of the owner's or participant's estate planning. If the primary beneficiary is an individual, a contingent beneficiary or beneficiaries normally should be named to take the benefits in the event the primary beneficiary predeceases the owner or participant. Details on beneficiaries is given in the following sections.

*The Owner's or Participant's Spouse Directly (Outright):* This is a common choice and offers many advantages. These include the ability to rollover qualified plan's death benefits to his or her own traditional IRA, or to assume a deceased spouse's IRA as his or her own, and hence, defer income taxation; the ability to qualify for the federal estate tax marital deduction, and hence, defer estate taxation; and exemption from the REA rules for qualified plans other than pension plans. On the other hand, this gives the surviving spouse complete control over the death benefits after the owner's or participant's death. For personal, family (e.g., a second marriage), or estate planning reasons, this may not be acceptable in some cases.

A planning technique that may be used in some cases is to name the spouse as primary beneficiary with a trust (that can skip the spouse's estate for estate tax purposes—a nonmarital or credit-shelter trust as described in Chapter 28) named as contingent beneficiary. Then, after the owner's or participant's death, the surviving spouse can decide whether to take the death benefit as the designated beneficiary or transfer it to his or her own IRA, or disclaim15 part or all of the death benefit within nine months after the owner's or participant's death and have the disclaimed part pass to the trust, which would avoid overqualifying the decedent's estate for the marital deductions and reduce estate taxes. This decision will depend on the circumstances after the owner's or participant's death. Of course, this technique also gives the surviving spouse complete control after death.

*An Individual or Individuals Other Than the Spouse Directly (e.g., a Child or Children):* As indicated earlier, if multiple beneficiaries are to be named, a useful planning technique to attain maximum income tax deferral after death is to divide an IRA into separate IRAs or to request the IRA custodian or trustee to divide the IRA account into subaccounts or sub-IRAs, with one for each beneficiary. Then, each beneficiary's life expectancy will govern minimum distributions from his or her IRA or subaccount.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume Helen Smith died, leaving her husband, Frank, as primary beneficiary of her \$1,100,000 401(k) account. After Helen's death, Frank decides to roll over the account balance to his own traditional IRA. The Smiths have three children: Tom, Susan, and Mary. Frank wants to name his (and Helen's) three children as equal beneficiaries of his IRA. Assume further that Frank tragically is killed in an automobile accident two years later, when the account balance in his IRA is \$1,200,000, and in the year after his death, the children's ages are as follows: Tom, age 55; Susan, age 52; and Mary, age 38.

If Frank simply named the children as equal multiple beneficiaries of his one IRA, Tom, age 55, who has the shortest life expectancy, would be considered the designated beneficiary and the entire IRA account balance would have to be paid out in annual amounts to the beneficiaries over Tom's life expectancy of 29.6 years (based on the Single Life Table and reduced by one year for each subsequent year). This means the entire account balance would have to be distributed to all beneficiaries within about 30 years since the 29.6 life expectancy number is reduced by one each year thereafter. On the other hand, if Frank had provided for the division of his IRA into a separate IRA (or subaccount)

<sup>15</sup>Qualified disclaimers are described in Chapter 26.

for each beneficiary (of about \$400,000 each), each child's own life expectancy (as designated beneficiary) would govern the minimum distributions to him or her starting the year after their father's death. This would be expectancies of 29.6 years for Tom, 32.3 years for Susan, and 45.6 years for Mary. The result would be substantially longer tax deferral (about 16 years, or 56 percent longer for the youngest beneficiary in this example).16

*A Trust That Qualifies for the Federal Estate Tax Marital Deduction (a Marital Trust):* This would be a trust for the surviving spouse's benefit during his or her lifetime, and then the corpus would pass to others at the surviving spouse's death. The benefits (trust corpus) would qualify for the federal estate tax marital deduction, so estate taxation would be deferred. Furthermore, if the trust meets the requirements described earlier, the surviving spouse, as beneficiary of the trust, will be considered the designated beneficiary for purposes of the minimum distribution rules, and plan or IRA benefits could be paid out in annual amounts over the spouse's life expectancy, determined by his or her age in each distribution year (i.e., recalculated). However, the rules for both minimum distributions and qualifying for the marital deduction must be met. Also, rollover of qualified plan balances to IRAs or treating IRAs as his or her own generally would not be available to a surviving spouse since he or she would not be the outright beneficiary. In addition, there would be no exemption from the REA and so the spouse would have to consent in the proper form for qualified plans.

*A Trust That Does Not Qualify for the Federal Estate Tax Marital Deduction (a Nonmarital, Credit Shelter, or Bypass Trust):* In essence, the corpus of these trusts is intended to be subject to federal estate taxation in the decedent's estate, but the estate tax is absorbed by the applicable credit amount (unified credit). Plan benefits might have to be paid to such a trust for estate planning reasons, usually because there are not enough other assets in the estate to fund such a trust at death. In general, however, use of qualified plan, TSA, or traditional IRA death benefits to fund nonmarital trusts is not attractive because they are IRD items. (See Chapter 28 for a more complete discussion of marital deduction planning.) Also note the use of such nonmarital trusts as contingent beneficiaries discussed previously.

<sup>16</sup> It may be noted that these principles and results would be substantially the same after Frank's death if this had been a Roth IRA (converted by Frank from his traditional IRA), except that Frank would not have had to take any minimum distributions during his lifetime, and so the balance would have been greater at his death and the distributions after his death would be tax free to the beneficiaries. Roth IRAs are subject to the minimum distribution rules after the owner's death.

*A Charity or a Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT):* When a participant or IRA owner is charitably inclined, this can be an interesting possibility. A charity named as beneficiary avoids income taxation, since a charity is taxexempt, and also avoids federal estate taxation because of the charitable estate tax deduction. Hence, the normal heavy taxation at death of these IRD items is avoided. CRTs are described in Chapter 19.

If a CRT is named as beneficiary, a surviving spouse could be the noncharitable income beneficiary and thus receive an income (either a unitrust or an annuity trust amount) for his or her lifetime. This income would be taxable. At the spouse's death, the corpus would go to the charity. As with any CRT, life insurance in an estate tax–protected irrevocable life insurance trust might be used to recoup the amount of the charitable gift for the family.

As noted earlier, the tax regulations have facilitated the naming of charities for at least part of a plan's death benefits. This is because the final designated beneficiary does not have to be determined until September 30 of the year following the year of the owner's or participant's death. Thus, when a charity and an individual(s) or trust are named, the charity's interest can be paid ("cashed out") before that date, leaving only the individual or individual trust benefcicaries as designated beneficiaries over whose life expectancy minimum distributions can be made. Of course, the same result could be achieved by the owner's dividing an IRA into separate IRAs or subaccounts during the owner's lifetime: one for the owner with the charity as beneficiary and one for the owner with the individual as beneficiary.

*Other Trusts:* Participants or owners (who perhaps are not married) may want to name other trusts as beneficiaries in particular circumstances.

*The Participant's or Owner's Estate:* This designation seems to have few planning advantages.
