#### **166 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

- Strategies for call protection
- Investment quality considerations (high-yield securities)
- Overall strategies

The previous two chapters have dealt with various equity-type investments. Yet, for most individuals, equity investments should form only part of their overall asset allocation strategy. One or more types of fixed-income securities generally should also be included. Simply stated, fixed-income investments generally promise the investor a stated amount of income periodically, and in most cases, also promise to pay the face amount at its maturity date.

# **Types of Fixed-Income Investments**

Fixed-income securities and investments include the following:

- N Corporate bonds
- N Municipal bonds
- N Marketable U.S. government obligations
- N U.S. savings bonds
- N U.S. government agency securities
- N Mortgage- and asset-backed securities (pass-through securities)
- N Zero-coupon bonds (corporate, municipal, and U.S. government)
- N CDs
- N Stable-value funds
- N Liquid assets (cash equivalents)
- N Preferred stocks

# **Ways of Taking Returns from Bonds**

Before discussing the various types of bonds, it will be helpful to note the ways in which investors can purchase marketable bonds and take returns from them. This discussion will help explain the income tax status of various bonds. Furthermore, as with common stocks, the total return from a bond over a given period is the market price at the end of the period minus the market price at the beginning of the period (capital gain or loss) plus interest paid during the period.

## **Bonds Purchased at Par**

When the purchase price of a bond is equal to its value at maturity (par value or face amount), it is purchased at par. The investor receives the interest payments (coupon rate) until maturity, at which time the investor receives the face amount. If the investor sells or redeems the bond prior to maturity, the investor will realize a capital gain (or loss) if the sale price is more (or less) than his or her tax basis (cost) in the bond.

#### **Market Discount Bonds**

These are bonds purchased in the open market after issuance at a price less than the face amount of the bond (assuming the bond was originally issued at par). For example, an investor might purchase a 4.5 percent \$1,000 faceamount bond due to mature in 10 years for \$937. In this case, the investor receives the interest payments (coupon rate of 4.5 percent times \$1,000 or \$45 per year) until maturity, at which time the investor will receive the \$1,000 face amount, which includes \$63 of market discount.

If the investor sells or redeems the bond prior to maturity, he or she will realize a gain (or loss) if the sale price is more (or less) than his or her adjusted tax basis in the bond. A gain may be partially a recovery of market discount and partially a capital gain. A loss will be a capital loss.

## **Original Issue Discount (OID) Bonds**

Here the bonds are originally issued at a price less than the face amount of the bond. When these bonds pay no current interest (they have a coupon rate of zero), they are called *zero coupon bonds* or *zeros.* For example, an investor might purchase a \$1,000 bond with a zero percent coupon rate due to mature in 20 years for a price of \$255. In this case, he or she receives no current interest payments, but at maturity receives the \$1,000 face amount, which includes \$745 of original issue discount. If the investor sells the bond prior to maturity, he or she will realize a gain (or loss) if the sale price is more (or less) than his or her adjusted tax basis in the bond.

#### **Bonds Purchased at a Premium**

These are bonds purchased in the open market after issuance at a price greater than the face amount. For example, an investor might purchase a 6.25 percent \$1,000 face-amount bond due to mature in 28 years for a price of \$1,091. Here, the investor receives the interest payments (coupon rate of 6.25 percent times \$1,000 or \$62.50 per year) until maturity, when he or she receives the \$1,000 face amount. If the investor sells and redeems the bond prior to maturity, he or she will realize a capital gain (or capital loss) if the sale price is more (or less) than the adjusted tax basis in the bond.

#### **Bonds Held by Intermediaries**

When bonds are held in mutual funds, in variable life insurance and variable annuity products, or in qualified retirement plans, their returns are generally treated like returns in these funds or accounts.

# **Corporate Bonds**

These are bonds issued by private corporations and usually are based on the creditworthiness of the issuing corporation. They are viewed as less secure than U.S. Treasury issues (the most secure) and less secure than most municipal bonds.

## **Security for Corporate Bonds**

Some bonds, such as equipment trust certificates and mortgage bonds, are secured by a lien on all or a portion of the property of the company. Many bonds, however, are *debentures,* bonds backed by the full credit of the issuing corporation but with no special lien on the corporation's property. Debentures generally have first claim on all assets not specifically pledged under other bond indentures. *Subordinated debentures* have a claim on assets after claims of senior debt. Bond issues may have sinking-fund provisions designed to retire a substantial portion of the bonds before maturity.

# **Call Provisions**

Many corporate bonds can be redeemed, or *called,* before maturity. However, many corporations now issue securities that offer investors call protection for a specified period. Investors are willing to accept lower yields in exchange for some call protection or for bonds that are not callable at all. Call protection in bonds tends to vary with economic conditions. Unfortunately, no one really knows how interest rates will move in the future.

## **Tax Status of Corporate Bonds**

As a general principle, the investment income from corporate bonds is fully taxable for federal income tax purposes. It also is generally fully taxable for state income tax purposes. (Some states do not have income taxes.) The *current interest paid* (coupon rate) is taxable as ordinary interest income. *Market discount* also is generally taxed as ordinary income. *Original issue discount* (OID) is taxed as ordinary income.

If a corporate bond is purchased at a premium, the investor may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining life of the bond (or sometimes until an earlier call date). Depending on when the bond was purchased, the investor may use the amount amortized each year to reduce the otherwise taxable interest on the bond or as an itemized deduction. Either way, the amount amortized serves to reduce otherwise taxable ordinary income. The amount amortized also reduces the investor's tax basis in the bond. If the investor does not elect to amortize the premium, it is added to the basis and either reduces capital gain on disposition of the bond for more than the basis or produces a capital loss on disposition for less than the basis.

If a corporate bond is sold or redeemed prior to maturity, amounts received in excess of the basis generally are taxable as capital gains. However, in the case of market discount bonds or OID bonds, part or all of any gain may be taxed as ordinary interest income.

# **Municipal Bonds (Munis) Tax-Free versus Taxable Returns**

An important feature of municipal bonds is that interest is exempt from federal income tax and from state and local income taxes in the states in which the bonds are issued. Municipals are particularly attractive to persons whose income tax brackets enable them to realize greater after-tax return from taxfree interest than from interest that is fully taxable. Columns 2, 3, and 4 of Table 7.1 illustrate the relationship between the effective after-tax returns on municipal bonds and those of certain other fixed-income investments. Column 5 shows the equivalent taxable yields to a 5.5 percent tax-free yield at various marginal federal income tax rates applicable in 2009.

For example, a husband and wife who file a joint return and are in a 33 percent federal income tax bracket would keep, on an after-tax basis, all the income from a tax-free municipal bond (or 5.5 percent, as shown in Table 7.1). But this same couple could keep only 3.35 percent from a CD paying 5 percent (taxable) and only 4.69 percent from a 7 percent corporate bond (taxable). Based on these figures, this couple should consider municipals. Note that while yields will change over time, it is the investor's top marginal tax rate combined with the relationship between municipal bond yields and comparable taxable yields that are the basic points for the investor to consider.

If state and local taxes are considered, the after-tax yields on municipals that are free from federal, state, and local taxes are even more attractive.1 To determine the combined effective federal and state top marginal income tax rate, assuming an investor itemizes federal income tax deductions, it is necessary to adjust the top marginal state tax rate to reflect the fact that state and local income taxes are deductible in arriving at federal taxable income. This adjustment involves multiplying the state rate by 1 minus the marginal federal rate to determine the effective state rate.

<sup>1</sup>These are sometimes called *triple-tax-free* municipal bonds. They are free of federal income tax, and states and municipalities generally do not tax the interest (and sometimes the capital gains) on municipal bonds issued in the state.

**Table 7.1.** After-Tax Returns on Fixed-Income Investments\*

\*All values are in terms of percentages. These yields do not consider the possible effects of state or local government income taxation, which can vary considerably among the states.

†This equivalent taxable yield is calculated by dividing the tax-free yield (5.5% ) by 1 minus the top marginal federal income tax rate.

If we assume the married couple in our example has a top marginal state and local tax rate of 6 percent and itemizes federal deductions, their effective state rate is 6 percent × (1 – 0.33) or 4.02 percent. Their combined effective federal and state rate then is 37.02 percent (33 percent federal rate + 4.02 percent effective state rate). In this event, the after-tax (federal, state, and local) return from the 7 percent corporate bond from Table 7.1 would be 4.41 percent and the equivalent taxable yield for a 5.5 percent municipal would be 8.73 percent.

If an investor does not itemize deductions for federal tax purposes and, hence, state and local income taxes are not deductible, the combined effective federal and state rate can simply be stated as the top federal rate plus the top state rate (or 33 + 6 = 39 percent in the previous illustration). Note that this analysis does not apply to U.S. Treasury securities or other direct U.S. government obligations because their interest is exempt from state and local income taxation.

# **Call Provisions**

Like corporate bonds, municipals are often callable. However, they may be callable only after a certain date and/or have other call protection. Also, some municipals are not callable at all.

# **Kinds of Municipal Bonds**

**General-Obligation Bonds** This is an important category of municipal bonds; they are secured by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the issuing state or municipality. General-obligation bonds are normally considered to offer a high level of security for the investor, consistent, of course, with the credit rating of the issuer.

**Special Tax Bonds** These bonds are payable only from the proceeds of a single tax, a series of taxes, or some other specific source of revenue.

**Revenue Bonds** Revenue bonds are issued to finance various kinds of projects, such as water, sewage, gas, and electrical facilities; hospitals; dormitories; hydroelectric power projects; and bridges, tunnels, turnpikes, and expressways. The principal and interest on such bonds are payable solely from the revenues produced by the project.

**Housing Authority Bonds** These bonds are issued by local authorities to finance the construction of low-rent housing projects and are secured by the pledge of unconditional, annual contributions by the Housing Assistance Administration, a federal agency. Housing authority bonds are considered top-quality investments.

**Industrial Development Bonds (IDBs)** These bonds are issued by a municipality or other authority but are secured by lease payments made by industrial corporations that occupy or use the facilities financed by the bond issue.

**Insured Municipal Bonds** Many municipal bonds carry insurance to protect investors against the risk of default on the bonds. Such insurance enhances the creditworthiness of the bonds and normally gives them the highest-quality rating. Three large insurers of municipal bonds are the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), Municipal Bond Investors Assurance (MBIA), and the American Municipal Bond Assurance Corporation (AMBAC). It is the financial strength of these private insurers that stands behind their insurance of municipal bond issues. In the uncertain economic conditions as of this writing, however, some questions have been raised concerning the financial strength of some bond insurers. It seems prudent, therefore, for municipal bond investors to consider the fundamental credit quality of the bond itself and not rely solely on the bond insurance.

# **Municipal Bond Ratings**

Quality ratings on municipal bonds are provided by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the financial services that also rate corporate bonds. (See the section in this chapter, "Bond Ratings and Investment Quality.") In general, high-grade municipals rank second in quality only to securities issued by the U.S. government and government agencies.

# **Tax Status of Municipal Bonds**

Interest on all municipal bonds issued prior to August 8, 1986, generally is exempt from all federal income taxation. However, for municipal bonds issued after August 7, 1986 (or other applicable dates), there is a three-tiered system of federal income taxation, as follows: (1) interest on public-purpose municipals remains free from all federal income taxation; (2) interest on taxexempt private-activity municipals (*qualified bonds* or *alternative minimum tax bonds*) is exempt from regular federal income taxation, but generally is a preference item for AMT purposes; and (3) interest on taxable privateactivity municipals is fully taxable for federal income tax purposes. To date, relatively few fully taxable municipals have been issued.

Since the interest on AMT bonds (private activity bonds used to finance such projects as airports, stadiums, and student loan programs) is a preference item for AMT purposes, it will cause AMT at either a 26 or a 28 percent rate for those subject to the AMT system.2 For those investors, AMT bonds are not attractive. However, since AMT bonds normally have higher yields than comparable public-purpose bonds, they may be attractive for investors who are not subject to the AMT.

For municipal bonds purchased after April 30, 1993, accrued market discount generally is taxed as ordinary income upon sale, redemption, or maturity of the bond. For bonds purchased before May 1, 1993, market discount is treated as capital gain.

OID in municipal bonds is not taxable, but for municipal bonds issued after September 3, 1982, and acquired after March 1, 1984, the owner's tax basis is increased by accrued tax-exempt OID.

If a fully tax-exempt, coupon-paying, municipal bond is purchased at a premium, the owner must amortize the premium over the remaining life of the bond (or sometimes until an earlier call date). However, the amount amortized each year is not deductible, nor does it reduce otherwise taxable interest. Instead, it simply reduces the tax-free interest received. Also, the owner must reduce his or her basis in the bond by the amount amortized each year.

If a municipal bond is sold or redeemed prior to maturity, amounts received in excess of basis generally are taxable as capital gains. However, for market discount bonds, part or all of any gain may be interest income.

# **U.S. Government Obligations**

#### **Treasury Bills**

Treasury bills are issued on a discount basis and are redeemed at face value at maturity. They generally have maturity periods of 13 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks, and are considered highly liquid (cash equivalents).

## **Treasury Notes**

Treasury notes have maturities from 1 to 10 years. They are issued at or near par, and their interest is paid semiannually.

## **Treasury Bonds**

Treasury bonds mature in more than 10 years. They also are issued at or near par, and their interest is paid semiannually.

2The AMT system is described in Chapter 11. As part of the economic stimulus program in 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provides that tax-exempt interest or private activity bonds issued in 2009 and 2010 will not be treated as AMT preference item.

## **Call Provisions**

In general, Treasury notes and bonds are not callable. Some long-term bonds are callable at par five years before maturity; otherwise, they are not callable. This lack of call risk and their highest credit standing can be important factors in planning a bond portfolio. They may lead investors to use long-term Treasury notes and bonds for the longest-maturity rung in laddering a bond portfolio, as explained later in this chapter.

# **Tax Status of Treasury Notes and Bonds**

The interest income from U.S. Treasury notes and bonds is taxable for federal income tax purposes. However, it is exempt from state and local income taxation. This somewhat increases the after-tax yields from Treasury notes and bonds, depending on the level of state and local taxation (if any) where the investor resides.

The current interest paid (coupon rate) is taxable as ordinary interest income. Market discount is generally taxed as ordinary income. In addition, OID is taxed as ordinary income. If Treasury notes or bonds are purchased at a premium, the investor may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining life of the bond. This operates in the same way as for corporate bonds. The sale of Treasury notes and bonds also produces the same general federal tax results as for corporate bonds.

## **Inflation-Indexed Treasury Notes and Bonds**

The Treasury has issued Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). These are Treasury notes or bonds with a fixed interest rate applied to a principal amount that is adjusted periodically for inflation or deflation based on an adjusted Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (CPI-U). They pay semiannual interest and then the principal amount (including any inflation or deflation adjustments) at maturity. However, there is a minimum guarantee payment at maturity if the principal at that time is less than the principal at issuance.

As an example, suppose the Treasury issued a \$1,000 10-year inflationindexed note with a fixed interest rate of 3.5 percent. Furthermore, assume that during the first year inflation was at 3 percent. At the end of the year, the note's principal amount would be adjusted to \$1,030 and 3.5 percent interest would be paid on that amount (\$36.05 per year). The principal amount would be adjusted regularly over its duration and paid to the bondholder at maturity. For tax purposes, the investor has gross income each year equal to the current interest paid plus any adjustment to principal for inflation (or less any deflation adjustment), even though the adjusted principal is not paid until maturity. Thus, an investor can have tax liability on an inflation adjustment without current cash from the note or bond with which to pay the tax. Thus, TIPS may be best suited for tax-advantaged vehicles, such as IRAs.

#### **Savings Bonds**

U.S. savings bonds are registered, noncallable, and nontransferable (i.e., nonmarketable) securities. Two kinds of savings bonds now being issued are Series EE (or E) and Series I, which are inflation-indexed. There are also Series HH bonds, but they are no longer being issued.

Series EE bonds are sold in face-volume denominations of \$50 to \$10,000, with the purchase price of paper bonds being 50 percent of the face amount, while electronic EE bonds are sold at face value. EE paper bonds pay no current interest; instead, they are issued at a discount and are redeemable at face value on the maturity date. The interest rate on EE bonds issued prior to May 1, 2005 is a *market-based rate* and is set by the Treasury every six months. Bonds issued after April 30, 2005 carry the *fixed interest rate* that was in effect when the bonds were purchased and that continues for the 30-year lifetime of the bond. Such EE bonds are guaranteed to double in value in 20 years. EE bonds are redeemable at any time starting six months after issue, but redemption within the first five years reduces the effective yield.

Series I bonds are sold at face amount and accrue earnings until they are redeemed or mature (in 30 years). They accrue annual earnings at a composite rate consisting of a fixed rate for the bond's duration and a semiannual inflation rate (or deflation rate). When investors redeem EE and I bonds, or when they mature, investors normally are taxed on the difference between the purchase price and the redemption value as ordinary interest income. However, investors can elect to be taxed annually as bond interest accrues, but few do so. In addition, interest on Series I bonds and some EE bonds used for tuition and fees at colleges, universities, and qualified technical schools can be excluded from the bond owner's income under certain conditions. Also, savings bond interest is exempt from state and local income taxes.

Series HH bonds are interest-paying savings bonds that pay interest every six months. Previously, they could be secured at par in exchange for EE and similar bonds. HH bonds can be redeemed six months after issue, but they may be held to earn interest for as long as 20 years.

#### **Other U.S. Government and Agency Securities**

**U.S. Government Agency Securities** These securities are not issued directly by the federal government, but some have government guarantees. They typically carry somewhat higher yields than comparable U.S. government

#### **176 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

securities. Some of the governmental agencies that issue these securities are the federal home loan banks, Ginnie Mae (formerly the Government National Mortgage Association), and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank).

**Flower Bonds** These were U.S. government bonds that the federal government formerly accepted at par in payment of federal estate taxes. However, they are no longer being issued, and the last issue outstanding matured in 1998. Therefore, they now are of historical interest only.

#### **Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities (Pass-Through Securities)**

This is a participation in a pool of assets (e.g., mortgages) in which the investor receives a certificate evidencing his or her interest in the underlying assets. Probably the most important are the Ginnie Mae pass-throughs (which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and are considered as safe as U.S. government securities), Fannie Mae pass-throughs, and Freddie Mac pass-throughs. These certificates permit investors to earn higher mortgage yields.

A special feature of these securities is that part of the principal is returned with the interest each month as the underlying mortgages in the pool are amortized by the borrowers. Thus, these securities provide a higher level of secure income. On the other hand, there is inherent reinvestment risk in pass-throughs, in that if market interest rates decline significantly, mortgage borrowers will tend to pay off and refinance their loans at the lower rates. This will cause higher principal payments to the pass-through investors, who then must reinvest these payments at the current, lower interest rates. It also means the prices of pass-throughs will be less sensitive to declines in interest rates than for other bonds.

There are several categories of these securities. *Mortgage-backed securities* are participations in pools of mortgages, *asset-backed securities* are similar participations in pools of consumer or other loans, and *collateralized mortgage obligations* (CMOs) are a form of mortgage-backed security that may consist of portions with different investment characteristics. Another category is collateralized debt obligation (CDOs). These have caused considerable problems in recent years.

# **Market Discount Bonds General Characteristics**

As noted previously, market discount bonds sell in the market for less than their face amount (par value). Investors may like such bonds for several reasons. First, in effect, they provide automatic call protection because their coupon rates are relatively low, compared with current market interest rates. Also, their issuers normally must pay at least par value on redemption, which increases the cost of a call. In addition, they provide built-in income (or gain) upon maturity. Any kind of bond—corporate, municipal, or U.S. government—may sell at discount in the open market. The availability of such bonds and extent of the discounts depend on movements of interest rates. Rising interest rates—and hence, declining bond prices—tend to produce market discount bonds.

#### **Tax Status of Market Discount Bonds**

For taxable bonds issued after July 18, 1984, or for bonds issued on or before July 18, 1984, and purchased on the open market after April 30, 1993, any gain on sale, redemption, or maturity to the extent of accrued market discount will be taxed as ordinary interest income rather than capital gain.3 Any gain in excess of this amount will be taxed as capital gain, and any loss will be treated as capital loss. (For other taxable bonds, accrued market discount on sale, redemption, or maturity will be taxed as capital gain.)

However, cash-basis bondholders may elect to include accrued market discount each year in their gross income and have it taxed then, rather than deferring taxation until sale, redemption, or maturity of the bond. Most bondholders will not make this election; however, it might be made if the bondholder has unused interest expense to carry investments that can only be deducted against investment income (e.g., taxable interest) or in certain other situations.

For tax-exempt obligations purchased after April 30, 1993, any gain on sale, redemption, or maturity to the extent of accrued market discount will be taxed as ordinary interest income rather than as capital gain.

# **Zero Coupon Bonds (Zeros) General Characteristics**

These are OID bonds sold without any stated coupon rate; hence, they pay no current interest income. They are sold originally at usually substantial discounts from par, and their return to the investor is measured by their yield to maturity. Zeros may be U.S. government bonds (taxable), corporate bonds

<sup>3</sup>There is a *de minimis* rule that ignores any market discount of less than one-quarter of 1 percent of the stated value at maturity times the number of years until maturity.

(taxable), or municipal bonds (tax exempt). The main advantage of zeros for investors is to lock in current interest rates for the duration of the bond.

#### **Tax Status of Zero Coupon Bonds**

For taxable bonds issued after July 1, 1982, an annual amount of accrued original issue discount (calculated by applying the bond's yield to maturity to an adjusted issue price) is currently taxable to the owner as ordinary interest income, even though the investor currently receives no cash income from the bonds.4 This treatment of taxable zeros has caused them to be used almost entirely in tax-protected vehicles, such as IRAs, qualified retirement plans, variable annuities, and variable life insurance, because in these vehicles, otherwise taxable income is not taxed currently.

For tax-exempt zeros (municipal bonds), accrued OID is not included in gross income. It is tax exempt, just like interest on other tax-free munis. This treatment of tax-exempt zeros results in investors holding them directly, since the accrued OID is not taxable.

# **Preferred Stocks**

Preferred stocks (or *preferreds*) represent equity capital of a corporation. The claim that preferred stockholders have against the assets of the corporation follows the claim of bondholders but precedes that of common stockholders. In almost all cases, a company must pay dividends on its preferred stock before paying anything on its common stock. However, a corporation can pass (omit) its preferred dividends without becoming insolvent. Thus, it is less risky for a corporation to issue preferred stock than bonds or some other debt instrument. On the other hand, the corporation cannot deduct preferred dividends for corporate income tax purposes, although it can deduct interest on bonds or other true indebtedness.

The dividend rate on preferred stock is usually fixed. When dividends are *cumulative,* any arrears of preferred dividends must be paid before dividends can be paid on the common stock. On the other hand, when dividends are noncumulative, common dividends can be paid even though preferred dividends have been omitted in the past and remain unpaid. Although preferreds typically do not have fixed maturities, they may be subject to call. Preferred

<sup>4</sup>There is a *de minimis* rule here, too, like that indicated in Footnote 3. Also, for OID bonds issued before July 2, 1982 (and after December 31, 1954), OID is included in gross income when the bond is sold, is redeemed, or matures.

stockholders normally do not have voting rights, but they may have them in some cases or under certain conditions. Some preferreds are convertible into common stock.

# **Guaranteed Principal Fixed-Income Investments**

The types of fixed-income investments we have discussed so far provide guaranteed investment income and/or a promised value at maturity, but during the term of the investment (e.g., until a bond matures), the market price of the security can fluctuate, depending on market interest rates and other economic conditions.

The fixed-income investments we are now considering have both a guaranteed principal value throughout their term and certain guaranteed investment income. Such investments do not have any market risk or interest risk to their principal value. They may, however, have some financial risk in that their security (in the absence of government insurance) depends on the ability of the issuer to meet its financial commitments.

# **Certificates of Deposit (CDs)**

**Traditional Fixed-Dollar CDs** These are interest-bearing, redeemable evidences of time deposits issued and sold through banks and savings institutions. They are sold in varying amounts and with maturities ranging from a few months to 10 years or more. The interest rate usually is fixed and guaranteed for the duration of the CD, with the rate normally being higher the longer the maturity. There is an interest penalty for early withdrawal if these CDs are redeemed prior to maturity, but any penalty is deductible by the investor from gross income to arrive at adjusted gross income. As of this writing, most CDs are insured up to \$250,000 per eligible account through the FDIC. Also, an investor may purchase insured CDs up to \$250,000 each from multiple banks and still be fully insured. Interest payable on CDs is fully taxable for federal and state purposes as ordinary interest income.

**Negotiable CDs** These are CDs that are not redeemable by the issuer before maturity but can be traded in a secondary market prior to maturity. If they are sold before maturity, the value received may be less (if market interest rates rise) or more (if market rates fall) than the face amount (purchase price). However, the full face amount is payable at maturity. In this sense, they are much like bonds. Negotiable CDs are issued by banks but usually sold through investment firms.

#### **180 Part II. Investment Planning and Financial Management**

**Market-Linked CDs** Some banks issue CDs whose principal (original investment) is guaranteed by the issuer and often is insured up to \$250,000 by the FDIC, but whose investment return is based on some equity index (like the S&P 500 stock index), provided the purchaser holds the CD until maturity. In other words, if the market goes up, the investor receives his or her original principal plus an investment return based on the appreciation of the applicable market index. If the market goes down, the investor is guaranteed to receive at least his or her original investment back. However, these CDs, which are often called *market-linked deposits* (MLDs), may not pay 100 percent of the original investment, or any investment income, if an investor withdraws from them prior to maturity.

A difficulty with MLDs is that the depositor does not receive any investment returns until maturity, but those gains are taxed currently as ordinary income. For this reason, MLDs are often considered for tax-protected accounts. Also, as of this writing, MLDs are not generally available.

#### **Guaranteed-Dollar Life Insurance Cash Values**

As noted in Chapters 9 and 21, the cash values of guaranteed-dollar life insurance contracts (traditional whole life, universal life, or interest-sensitive whole life) can be viewed as a guaranteed principal fixed-income investment.

#### **Guaranteed-Dollar Annuity Cash Values**

Guaranteed-dollar (or fixed-dollar) annuity cash values also can be considered guaranteed principal fixed-income investments. The characteristics of investment annuities are discussed in Chapter 17.

## **Stable Value Funds**

These are investment options for employees under certain kinds of qualified retirement plans provided under a contract with a life insurance company or other financial institution. The issuer guarantees the principal and interest of the fund for the specified period. Employees should remember, however, that the security behind a stable value fund is the financial soundness of the company providing it.

# **Cash Equivalents (Liquid Assets)**

Cash equivalents should be highly liquid (convertible into cash immediately with no loss of principal) and financially secure (low or no financial risk). On the other hand, these assets are short-term and tend to offer a lower yield than other fixed-income securities.5 Investors may want liquid assets for possible emergencies, as security in times of severe economic uncertainty, to quickly take advantage of investment opportunities, as an investment strategy if interest rates are expected to rise significantly, or as a repository for cash while deciding on an investment or other large expenditure.

Some common types of cash-equivalent assets include:

- N *Shorter-term CDs* (insured).
- N *Bank savings accounts* (insured).
- N *Money market funds.*
- N *Treasury bills.*
- N *Commercial paper*. These are short-term unsecured loans normally made to large creditworthy corporations. Commercial paper often is purchased by money market mutual funds.
- N *Banker's acceptances*. These are time drafts usually used to finance international trade that are "accepted" (guaranteed) by a bank. They also are often purchased by money market mutual funds.
- N *Eurodollars.* These are dollar-denominated accounts or CDs in Europe that are issued by foreign banks or foreign branches of U.S. banks.
- N *Yankee CDs.* These are dollar-denominated accounts or CDs that are issued by branches of foreign banks in the United States.

# **Conversion Privileges in Fixed-Income Securities**

Investors may consider whether to buy *convertible bonds* or *convertible preferred stocks,* which provide the security of a bond or a preferred, but also provide an opportunity for capital appreciation through anticipated appreciation of the underlying common stock. Convertible bonds and preferreds give the holder the right to convert the security into a certain number of shares of common stock at a predetermined price for the common.

But this opportunity is not free. The price effectively is the difference between the yield on a convertible bond or preferred and the yield on an

<sup>5</sup>This statement reflects the general principle that for a given quality of fixed-income investment, the yield will rise with duration. This may be referred to as a positive (or normal) yield curve. However, under certain economic conditions, this yield curve can be quite flat (with little or no difference in yields between shorter-term and longer-term securities of the same type) or even inverted (with shorter-term yields higher than longer-term yields). A flat or inverted yield curve may occur, for example, when investors generally believe that interest rates will fall significantly in the future and thus are seeking to lock in the present rates by buying (and hence bidding up the prices of) longer-term securities with adequate call protection (such as longer-term Treasury notes and bonds).

otherwise comparable nonconvertible security. Convertible securities generally are callable.

# **Bond Ratings and Investment Quality**

Bonds issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government are considered the safest of investments. Other bonds have varying quality ratings in terms of financial risk.

# **Bond Rating Systems**

To help investors assess the investment quality of many corporate and municipal bonds, bond ratings are published, periodically reviewed, and revised when needed by independent rating agencies. The two main rating agencies are Moody's and Standard & Poor's.6 The corporate and municipal debt-rating systems of these two agencies are outlined in Table 7.2. These ratings consider the creditworthiness or financial ability to meet the specific obligations of the issuer of the particular bonds involved. Bonds with one of

| Quality                   | Standard & Poor's† | Moody's† |
|---------------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Investment grade:         |                    |          |
| Highest quality*          | AAA                | Aaa      |
| High quality              | AA                 | Aa       |
| Upper medium grade        | A                  | A        |
| Medium grade              | BBB                | Baa      |
| Below investment grade:   |                    |          |
| Moderately speculative*   | BB                 | Ba       |
| Speculative               | B                  | B        |
| Highly speculative        | CCC                | Caa      |
| Lowest quality (including | C, D               | C        |
| in default)               |                    |          |

**Table 7.2.** Bond Rating Systems

\*These are abbreviated terms used to describe these rating systems and are not the complete descriptions used by the rating agencies themselves to describe their ratings.

† There may be subclasses within these letter ratings, designated as 2 or 3 by Moody's and + or – by Standard & Poor's.

6These agencies also rate many insurance companies for financial soundness or claims-paying ability. They also rate commercial paper.

the top four ratings from one or both agencies are often considered investment grade.7 Bonds with lower ratings are considered by the rating agencies to have varying degrees of speculative elements.

# **High-Yield Bonds**

*High-yield,* or *junk, bonds* generally are considered those with ratings below investment grade. As can be seen from Table 7.2, however, this can embrace a wide range of financial risk. Therefore, in evaluating high-yield bonds, the investor should consider the relative degrees of financial risk involved. In other words, some bonds are "junkier" than others. Of course, the spread between the yields on investment-grade bonds and high-risk bonds should be evaluated to see if the extra financial risk is worth it.

# **Bond Ratings and Yield**

**General Considerations** A major question in high-yield investing is whether the higher yields on lower-quality bonds at least make up for the higher default rates on such bonds. Part of this question, of course, is what the real, long-term, average annual default rates are on bonds of lower quality. While a review of the research on this issue is beyond the scope of this book, it appears at this writing that no one really knows.

**Diversification Issues** Diversification seems to be the key idea in this area. First, to be a successful investor in high-risk bonds, it seems necessary to be reasonably diversified over a number of issues and perhaps maturities. The investor really has no way of knowing which particular bond or bonds may default. For investors with relatively small amounts of these bonds, mutual funds may be a logical answer to their diversification needs. It may also be desirable to invest only a small percentage of one's overall portfolio in highrisk bonds.

# **Strategies for Investing in Fixed-Income Securities**

As the discussion in this chapter has unfolded, it can be seen that there are several areas where investors need to develop strategies with respect to the fixed-income portions of their overall asset allocations.

7Moody's judges bonds in its top two ratings to be of high quality.

#### **Investment Duration Considerations**

One approach to duration issues would be to adjust maturities, at least to some degree, with regard to expected changes in interest rates. As a rule, maturities should be lengthened when interest rates are expected to decline and should be shortened when interest rates are expected to rise. In this way, investors will have committed their funds at the present high rates, when future rates are expected to be lower, and will have funds available to commit later at the expected higher rates, when it is anticipated that interest rates will be higher. Of course, no one really knows which way interest rates will move in the future. On the other hand, investors can follow a *diversified approach* toward the maturity structure, such as laddering a bond portfolio.

**Laddered Diversification to Deal with Interest Rate and Reinvestment Risks** In view of the uncertainties concerning interest rates just noted, one possible approach for the risk-averse investor is to diversify the bond or bond-and-CD portion (the fixed-income portion) of the overall portfolio according to the maturity of the instruments in the portfolio. This is referred to as *laddering* a bond portfolio.

**Maturity Range Percentages of Bond-and-CD Portion of the Overall Fixed-Income Portfolio**

Thus, just as an example, the bond-and-CD portion of an investor's overall portfolio might be laddered, as shown in the table.

 1–5 years (short-term bonds or CDs) 5–15 years (intermediate-term bonds) 15–30 years (long-term bonds) 33% 33% 34% With this kind of allocation, there would be some protection for the investor, no matter which way interest rates went. If market rates declined, the inves-

tor would benefit at the long end of the portfolio and be harmed only at the short end. The portion of the portfolio with longer maturities could provide a locked-in interest income stream and bond market prices would rise. However, for these benefits to remain, the securities at the long end should be noncallable or have reasonable call protection. (See the following section on "Strategies for Call Protection and Reinvestment Risk".) On the other hand, if interest rates rose, in terms of bond prices, the investor would not be greatly harmed at the short end of the portfolio and would be significantly harmed only at the long end, although there would be at least some bond price declines at all maturity levels. The values of any bank-distributed CDs would not change, except for possible interest penalties for early redemption. Furthermore, at the short end of the portfolio, there would be some bonds or CDs maturing each year whose maturity values then could be reinvested at the current higher rates.

The allocation of maturities in a portfolio could be periodically reviewed in light of the investor's expectations for future interest rates. If rates are expected to rise, relatively greater weight can be given to shorter maturities; the strategy can be reversed if rates are expected to decline. Or the investor can simply stick with a more balanced and longer-term allocation, as shown in the example, and not try to outguess the economy. This is an example of *immunizing a bond portfolio* against fluctuating interest rates.

**Barbell Strategy** A variation of this approach is the so-called *barbell strategy.* This essentially involves buying only short maturities and long maturities.

## **Taxable versus Nontaxable Considerations**

Investors need to evaluate the relative after-tax attractiveness of taxable as compared to tax-exempt securities. This should be done considering federal, state, and local income taxes, particularly in states with high income taxes. The factors involved in this analysis were discussed earlier in this chapter.

# **Strategies for Call Protection and Reinvestment Risk**

Investors also need to evaluate their exposure to interest rate and reinvestment risks. Some strategies for doing this have already been discussed (e.g., laddering). The following are some approaches investors can use to protect themselves from the call (or redeemability) risk:

- N Investors can buy noncallable securities (such as U.S. Treasury notes and bonds). When municipal and corporate bonds are issued on a noncallable basis, they usually are for relatively shorter maturities. Zero coupon bonds may not be callable.
- N They can buy securities with call protection.
- N Investors can buy bonds or preferreds selling at a deep discount (market discount) from their maturity or par value. However, sometimes, such deep discount securities are scarce in the bond markets, and the investor normally must accept a lower yield on them than for comparable securities selling around par.
- N Investors may be able to diversify their purchases over time so that only a small portion of the portfolio will be called at any one time.
- N They may purchase high-quality, higher-yielding common stocks, which, of course, have no maturity date and are not callable. However, dividends on common stocks could be cut or eliminated by the corporation during "hard" economic times.

#### **Investment-Quality Considerations**

We have already discussed the relationship between yield and bond ratings, and have noted that there do not seem to be any pat answers. Much depends on an investor's personal circumstances, investment objectives, and tolerance for risk. On the other hand, modern portfolio theory tells us that if lowerquality bonds have low correlations with other asset categories in a portfolio, overall portfolio risk may not be increased (and may even be decreased) by the addition of high-return, high-financial-risk, but low-correlation bonds.

There can be a variety of strategies regarding investment quality. Highly risk-averse investors may decide to purchase only bonds rated in the top two or three grades according to Moody's or Standard & Poor's and U.S. Treasury notes and bonds or U.S. government-guaranteed or backed bonds, or to invest only in mutual funds or other financial intermediaries that have these investment objectives. In contrast, other investors may decide to allocate the bulk of their bond portfolio—say, 75 to 80 percent—only to such investment-grade securities, while allowing the balance to be in below-investment-grade bonds if market conditions and yield spreads seem propitious. At the other end of the scale, investors who are more aggressive may be willing to allocate a larger portion of the fixed-income part of their portfolio to higher-yield bonds when they think market conditions and yield spreads warrant it.

#### **Overall Diversification Strategies**

Investors should decide when and how they want to diversify their fixedincome investments. This might include diversification by maturities (laddering), by high-quality and high-yield issues, by investing in municipal securities, and by investing in a number of different issues.
