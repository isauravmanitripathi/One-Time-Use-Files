## **Marital Deduction Planning**

For persons or couples with potential estates large enough to attract federal estate taxation, proper use of the unlimited federal estate tax marital deduction is a critical decision issue in estate planning.

#### **Using the Marital Deduction to Save Federal Estate Taxes**

The basic idea of the marital deduction is to allow married estate owners to leave as much of their estates as they wish to their surviving spouse free of federal estate tax.1 But this "marital" part must be left to a surviving spouse in such a way that it potentially would be included in the survivor's gross estate at his or her subsequent death. In tax language, these are referred to as transfers that *qualify* for the marital deduction. Thus, the marital deduction is essentially a tax-deferral technique.

Aside from tax deferral, another essential part of saving taxes through marital deduction planning is making sure that the applicable credit amount (unified credit) is fully used in *both* spouses' estates or lifetime gifts. This means the applicable exclusion amount will escape federal estate taxation in both spouses' estates and can pass tax free to their children or other family members. Thus, this exclusion amount, often in trust, bypasses the surviving spouse's gross estate and goes to the children or others. However, a surviving spouse can be given some or all of the so-called almost-owner powers (described in Chapter 26) in this bypass (nonmarital) trust. On the other hand, for tax or other reasons, the surviving spouse's rights in a bypass trust may be more limited.

Furthermore, it often is anticipated that a surviving spouse will consume, make lifetime gifts within the exclusions,2 make charitable gifts, or take other planning actions so that the marital deduction share he or she received from the deceased spouse will not actually end up in the surviving spouse's gross estate. These actions will be influenced in part by how the marital share is left to the surviving spouse.

#### **Essential Components of a Marital Deduction Strategy**

These include deciding how much (if any) of the marital deduction should be used; making sure each spouse can utilize his or her applicable credit amount, regardless of which spouse dies first; deciding how (i.e., through what vehicles or in what ways) property is to qualify for the marital deduction; and deciding how the marital share should be funded. These issues can be complex, so only their basic elements are covered here. The illustrations used in this chapter are for explanatory purposes only.

<sup>1</sup>The marital deduction was originally placed in the tax code in 1948 with the goal of generally equalizing the tax situation of married persons in common-law states and communityproperty states. The maximum deduction then was one-half the adjusted gross estate. It became unlimited in 1981 under the Economic Recovery Tax Act.

<sup>2</sup>An attractive plan here may be for the surviving spouse to directly pay tuitions and/or medical expenses for, say, children or grandchildren, as well as make annual exclusion gifts out of his or her marital deduction share.

### **Overall Goals of Marital Deduction Planning**

In many cases, spouses want first to assure the financial security of the surviving spouse for his or her remaining lifetime (sometimes called the surviving spouse's "overlife") and then plan for maximum wealth transfer for other generations. But if both spouses have significant assets and adequate income, they may give more weight to wealth transfer to future generations. In some cases, such as second marriages where both spouses have children or grandchildren from prior marriages, both spouses may be thinking primarily of leaving their wealth (or much of it) to their own children and grandchildren. Naturally, the spouses' objectives should guide their marital deduction strategies.

#### **How Much (If Any) of the Marital Deduction Should Be Used?**

Since the marital deduction is unlimited, at first blush, married estate owners may be tempted to plan on leaving all their assets outright to their spouse. These are sometimes dubbed "I love you wills." However, for tax reasons, the maximum deduction normally should not be used in situations where a federal estate tax may be payable. This will result in the estate being overqualified for the marital deduction, which may result in higher overall taxes. The following illustrations3 point out some common issues in deciding how much property to qualify.

**Estates Less Than the Applicable Exclusion Amount** In situations where the gross estates of both spouses combined are expected to be less than the applicable exclusion amount, property can be left in full (or in lesser amounts) to either spouse with no adverse estate tax effects. In Example 1, assume that Harry Carter has an adjusted gross estate (gross estate minus debts and expenses) of \$2,000,000 and his wife Martha has an adjusted gross estate (AGE) of \$1,500,000. They each have wills leaving everything outright to the other (reciprocal wills). If Harry dies in 2009, his estate situation will be as follows.

*Example 1*

| Adjusted gross estate      | \$2,000,000                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Marital deduction          | –\$2,000,000 (to Martha under Harry's will) |
| Taxable estate             | \$0                                         |
| Federal estate tax payable | \$0                                         |

<sup>3</sup> In all these illustrations, state death taxes and the federal estate tax deduction for state death taxes paid are ignored for the sake of simplicity. It is also assumed that administration expenses are taken as deductions on the estate tax return.

Now, if Martha dies later with the same unified credit, her estate situation will be4 :

| Adjusted gross estate      | \$1,500,000 (in her own name)   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
|                            | \$2,000,000 (from Harry's will) |
|                            | \$3,500,000                     |
| Marital deduction          | \$0                             |
| Taxable estate             | \$3,500,000                     |
| Tentative estate tax       | \$1,455,800                     |
| Applicable credit amount   | –\$1,455,800                    |
| Federal estate tax payable | \$0                             |

The estate tax situation would not change if Martha dies first.

**Avoid Overqualifying for Marital Deduction** Once the combined estates of husband and wife exceed the applicable exclusion amount, it is better taxwise to qualify less than the maximum allowable deduction. This is because there is no tax advantage in an estate owner qualifying that part of his or her estate that will be shielded from estate tax by the unified credit. However, when the surviving spouse dies, there is a tax disadvantage if the first spouse to die qualified all of his or her estate for the deduction. This is because all the property that passes to the surviving spouse in a qualifying manner will be included in that spouse's gross estate at death, unless he or she consumes it or makes nontaxable gifts while alive. As just noted, when all or "too much" property is qualified, it is referred to as an estate being *overqualified* for the marital deduction. This can occur in a variety of ways.

*All Property to Spouse:* Let us use the same facts as in Example 1, except Harry's adjusted gross estate is \$4,500,000 and Martha's is \$2,500,000. They have reciprocal wills as before. In this case (Example 2), if Harry dies in 2009, his estate situation will be as follows.

*Example 2*

| Adjusted gross estate      | \$4,500,000                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Marital deduction          | –\$4,500,000 (to Martha under Harry's will) |
| Taxable estate             | \$0                                         |
| Federal estate tax payable | \$0                                         |

<sup>4</sup> In all these illustrations, appreciation or depreciation in assets between the deaths is ignored for the sake of simplicity. It is also assumed that the surviving spouse does not remarry and no specific bequests to others are made. Furthermore, it is assumed that the federal estate tax is not repealed and the applicable credit amount (unified credit) remains at \$1, 455, 800 in the future. These assumptions are in line with the likely changes in the estate tax law noted in Chapter 26

Adjusted gross estate \$2,500,000 (in her own name) \$4,500,000 (from Harry's will) \$7,000,000 Marital deduction \$0 Taxable estate \$7,000,000 Tentative estate tax \$3,030,800 Applicable credit amount –\$1,455,800 Federal estate tax payable \$1,575,000

But if Martha dies later, her estate situation will be:

Note that this tax occurs because an applicable credit amount is used in only one of the two estates (in the survivor's estate). This tax situation would be the same if Martha had predeceased Harry. It may be observed, however, that the estate tax would have been substantially eliminated if the unused unified credit at Harry's death could have been transferred to Martha's estate. This is the possible change of "portability" of unified credits between spouses as noted in Chapter 26.

*Too Much Jointly Owned Property:* Now suppose that Harry and Martha Carter own all of their \$7,000,000 adjusted gross estate as joint tenants with right of survivorship.5 In this situation (Example 3), if Harry dies in 2009, his estate situation will be as follows:

*Example 3* Adjusted gross estate (0.5 × \$7,000,000) \$3,500,000 Marital deduction –\$3,500,000 Taxable estate \$0 Federal estate tax payable \$0 If Martha dies later, her estate situation will be: Adjusted gross estate (\$7,000,000 by operation of law) \$7,000,000 Marital deduction \$0 Taxable estate \$7,000,000 Tentative estate tax \$3,030,800 Applicable credit amount –\$1,455,800 Federal estate tax payable \$1,575,000

The result would be the same if Martha had predeceased Harry.

*Estate Consisting of Qualified Retirement Plan or IRA Death Benefits:* The same kind of overqualification can occur in situations where people have the bulk of their estates in qualified retirement plans or IRAs

5This, of course, is unlikely as a practical matter. However, this assumption helps illustrate the problem of owning too much property as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

naming their spouse as beneficiary. In this event, the plan's death benefits will be in the participant's gross estate but will qualify for the marital deduction. Thus, the participant's estate may be overqualified.

**Reduce-to-Zero (Zero-Tax) Formula Provision** This type of provision in a will or revocable living trust6 is designed to pass to the surviving spouse just enough of the estate to eliminate (or reduce to the lowest possible figure) the federal estate tax at the first spouse's death and to pass the remainder of the estate so that it does not qualify for the marital deduction. This normally results in no tax at the first spouse's death.

This kind of clause might provide, for example, that the smallest fractional share of the estate, when added to other items in the gross estate that have passed to the surviving spouse outside the probate estate or under other parts of the will or trust and that qualify for the marital deduction, will reduce the federal estate tax payable at the first spouse's death to zero or the lowest possible amount, after taking into account deductions from the gross estate (other than this marital deduction) and credits allowed in calculating the federal estate tax, will pass to the surviving spouse in a way that will qualify for the marital deduction (e.g., outright or in a marital trust).7 Then, the residue of the estate, which normally will equal the applicable exclusion amount, passes in a way that does not qualify for the marital deduction. It may go, for example, to a *nonmarital trust,* in which the surviving spouse may (or may not) be given some or all of the almost-owner powers during his or her lifetime (overlife) and then with the corpus going to their children or others upon the surviving spouse's death. It also may go outright to other family members. The property in this trust or gift will not be in the surviving spouse's gross estate upon his or her death. Any state death taxes (and other nondeductible amounts) may be paid from this nonmarital trust or gift under a tax clause. This method of using marital and nonmarital trusts (sometimes called A and B trusts or marital and family trusts) or marital and nonmarital gifts to qualify the right amount or share for the marital deduction is commonly used.

To illustrate the reduce-to-zero formula clause, let us return to the facts in Example 2, except that Harry Carter follows a reduce-to-zero marital strategy

<sup>6</sup>Note that this formula provision or other marital deduction provision may be in a person's will or revocable living trust (described in Chapter 30), whichever document is the main vehicle for disposing of the person's estate at death. Neither vehicle has an advantage over the other in this respect.

<sup>7</sup> In terms of how the marital deduction is funded, this is a fractional share marital gift with the residue to a bypass gift. See further discussion under "Types of Marital Gifts" later in this chapter.

in his will or revocable trust. In this situation (Example 4), if Harry dies in 2009, his estate situation will be as follows:

| Example 4                                            |              |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Adjusted gross estate                                | \$4,500,000  |
| Marital deduction (which goes under the formula      |              |
| to the marital trust or gift or qualifies outside of |              |
| the will or trust)8                                  | –\$1,000,000 |
| Taxable estate (which goes to the bypass or          |              |
| credit-shelter trust or gift)                        | \$3,500,000  |
| Tentative estate tax                                 | \$1,455,800  |
| Applicable credit amount                             | –\$1,455,800 |
| Federal estate tax payable                           | \$0          |
|                                                      |              |

If Martha dies later, her estate situation will be:

| \$2,500,000 (in her own name)              |
|--------------------------------------------|
| \$1,000,000 (from Harry's will or trust as |
| the marital gift or qualifying outside     |
| the will or trust)                         |
| \$3,500,000                                |
| \$0                                        |
| \$3,500,000                                |
| \$1,455,800                                |
| –\$1,455,800                               |
| \$0                                        |
|                                            |

There is no estate tax at either death in Example 4 if the order of deaths is as shown. This can be contrasted with the situations in Examples 2 and 3, where the Carters' estates were overqualified for the marital deduction and an estate tax of \$1,575,000 was due at the second death. As can be seen from Example 4, if the combined adjusted gross estates of both spouses are equal to or less than their combined applicable exclusion amounts, there may be no

8This is the total amount of marital deduction (probate property and nonprobate property) that will result in zero tax in this situation. If the entire \$4,500,000 of AGE were in Harry's probate estate (e.g., owned in his name), the \$100,000 would be in the marital trust or gift under his will. Normally, however, there will be several items of nonprobate property in an estate. If we assume, therefore, that Harry's AGE consists of \$600,000 in a 401(k) account, with Martha named as beneficiary (a nonprobate asset qualifying for the marital deduction), and the remainder in stocks, bonds, and real estate in his own name, the \$600,000 in 401(k) account balance would go directly to Martha and \$400,000 would be in the marital trust or gift under the will. The marital deduction still would be \$100,000, but it would consist of \$600,000 of nonprobate property and \$400,000 of probate property. The wording of the formula clause automatically adjusts the marital bequest for nonprobate property that qualifies for the marital deduction.

federal estate tax payable at either death, provided there is proper planning. Of course, if the estates were larger, say Harry's AGE was \$10,000,000, there would be some tax payable by the estate of the second spouse to die. Again, it may be observed that this marital trust (gift)-nonmarital trust (gift) strategy (the optimal marital) would no longer be necessary for purely estate tax savings reasons if unused unified credits were transferable between spouses, as has been proposed (see Chapter 26). In that case, each spouse could leave as much as he or she wished to the other spouse (up to the full marital deduction) and then any unused unified credit in the estate of the first spouse to die would be transferred to the estate of the second to die. Even in this situation, there may be non tax reasons to establish marital and nonmarital trusts.

However, if the order of deaths in Example 4 were reversed (i.e., Martha predeceased Harry), as matters now stand, there would be federal estate tax at Harry's subsequent death, even if Martha left her estate so as to bypass Harry's estate (for example, in trust for their children with almost-owner powers for Harry so that the corpus would not be in his gross estate at his death). The solution for this could be for Harry to make lifetime gifts to Martha so that the available applicable credit amount would shield both of their estates from taxation no matter who died first. Here again, the possible change in the law of allowing "portability" of unified credit between spouses, if enacted, would solve this problem without lifetime gifts between spouses.

**Status of Surviving Spouse Under the "Optimal Marital"** Particularly after EGTRRA with its increased unified credit, an issue with respect to reduce-tozero formula clauses is that they may cause too much wealth to flow into credit-shelter trusts (bypass or family trusts) that perhaps are mainly for children or others, as compared to wealth passing to the surviving spouse (in trust or outright). This may or may not be a problem, depending on the circumstances.

An example may help illustrate this issue. Suppose now that Harry and Martha were both married before, and each has one child from his or her prior marriage. There also is one child from their present marriage. Also suppose that Harry owns the bulk of their wealth (\$4,000,000) and Martha only has about \$200,000. Now assume Harry has a standard reduce-to-zero formula provision in his will under which two trusts are created: a martial trust (a Q-TIP trust) for Martha and a credit-shelter trust (the "family trust") which mainly benefits Harry's children. At Harry's death, under this formula, the least amount necessary to reduce the federal estate tax to zero is to go into the marital Q-TIP trust and the remainder is to go into the nonmarital family trust to take full advantage of the existing applicable exclusion amount.

In this situation, if Harry dies in 2009, the formula provision would act as follows:

| Adjusted gross estate                           | \$4,000,000  |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Marital deduction (by way of the Q-TIP trust)   | –\$500,000   |
| Taxable estate (which goes to the family trust) | \$3,500,000  |
| Tentative tax                                   | \$1,455,800  |
| Unified credit                                  | –\$1,455,800 |
| Federal estate tax payable                      | \$0          |

Thus, only \$500,000 would go to Martha (in trust) and \$3,500,000 would be in the family trust.

Also note that, aside from EGTRRA, this same issue can arise if estate values were to decline substantially, such as during a recession or depression.

Various suggestions have been made for dealing with this issue. Some of these include:

- N Give the surviving spouse various rights in or powers over the credit-shelter trust. For example, the spouse could be an income beneficiary (mandatory or discretionary), could be given limited powers of appointment over trust corpus, could be trustee if distributions are limited to an ascertainable standard, or could have other rights or powers that will not cause the corpus to be in his or her gross estate at the surviving spouse's subsequent death.
- N Use a dollar or fractional cap on the credit-shelter trust.
- N Provide for a minimum marital bequest (outright or in trust).
- N Use three trusts: a marital trust (Q-TIP trust) for the spouse, a creditshelter trust for the spouse but with no Q-TIP election, and a traditional credit-shelter trust for children or other beneficiaries.
- N Make a bequest to the surviving spouse (outright or in trust) and provide for a possible disclaimer by the spouse (discussed later in this chapter) to a nonmarital family trust.
- N Provide alternative trusts (marital and nonmarital) with authority in the executor or trustee to select amounts to fund each.
- N Separate marital and nonmarital trusts would not be needed (for tax reasons) if "portability" of unified credits were enacted.

Each of these approaches has its advantages and limitations. They vary in the power they give to the spouse or others to make final decisions at an estate owner's death. Of course, depending on family circumstances, nothing may need to be done.

**Equalization of Estates or Equalization of Rates Formula Provisions** An alternative formula provision in a will or trust was designed to equalize the spouses' estates or to equalize the tax rates in both estates at the first death. This results in some tax at the first death and some tax at the second death, but perhaps less aggregate tax on both estates. However, at present, this approach is no longer attractive because effectively there is a flat 45 percent federal estate tax rate over the exclusion amount.

## **Planning For Each Spouse**

In planning the appropriate use of the marital deduction, a common procedure is to assume one spouse dies followed by the other and to determine the taxes payable (if any) and the estate shrinkage at each death. Estate liquidity and income needs for the survivor can be evaluated after each death. Then the order of deaths is reversed and the analysis repeated. This is sometimes called the *hypothetical probate.* Recommendations then can be made for improvements in the situation.

#### **How Should Property Be Qualified for the Marital Deduction?**

Property can pass to a surviving U.S. citizen spouse in a variety of ways to qualify for the marital deduction.9 It can make considerable difference in planning how property qualifies.

**Outright Gifts or Bequests** This is the most direct way and gives the surviving spouse sole ownership and complete control over the property.

**Joint Ownership with Spouse (WROS)** Property held jointly by the spouses (with right of survivorship) will qualify to the extent that the property is included in the deceased spouse's gross estate (normally one-half). Here again, the surviving spouse has sole ownership and complete control over the property after the first spouse's death.

**Life Insurance Proceeds Payable to Surviving Spouse or to a Qualifying Trust for His or Her Benefit** Life insurance proceeds that are in the deceased spouse's gross estate and that are payable to the surviving spouse as beneficiary in a lump sum or under a settlement arrangement giving the spouse full withdrawal rights or only a life income will qualify. Also, life insurance proceeds payable to a trust which itself meets the requirements for qualifying its corpus will qualify.10

<sup>9</sup>QDOTs can be used for transfers to noncitizen spouses (see Chapter 26).

<sup>10</sup> It may be noted, however, that if a person's estate is going to be subject to federal estate taxation, it normally is better tax-wise to have life insurance on his or her life owned by and payable to an ILIT, as explained in Chapter 29. This allows the proceeds to be removed from the gross estates of both spouses and to go in trust for the benefit of their children, grandchildren, or others as beneficiaries of the ILIT.

**Other Beneficiary Designations Payable to Surviving Spouse** This can include a variety of situations. Probably most important are qualified retirement plans and IRAs.

The next items involve leaving or giving property in trust for a surviving spouse so that the trust corpus qualifies for the marital deduction.

**General Power of Appointment Trusts** Prior to the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, this was the traditional way to qualify property in trust for the marital deduction. To meet the requirements for a general power-of-appointment trust, all trust income must be payable at least annually to the surviving spouse for his or her lifetime, and the surviving spouse must have a general power of appointment over the trust corpus exercisable in all events during the spouse's lifetime, at the spouse's death (i.e., exercisable by his or her will), or both.

**Q-TIP Trusts** These probably are by far the most common choice of marital trusts today. To qualify the corpus for the marital deduction as a Q-TIP trust, all trust income must be payable, at least annually, to the surviving spouse for life, with no person having power to appoint any part of the property to anyone other than the surviving spouse during the spouse's lifetime. However, the original estate owner (or another person) can create powers over, or control the ultimate disposition of, the trust property, which will take effect after the surviving spouse's death. For a trust that meets the requirements just stated to become a Q-TIP trust, the deceased spouse's executor must make an irrevocable election on a timely filed (with extensions)11 estate tax return to treat the whole trust or only a specific portion (fraction or percentage) of it as a Q-TIP trust. A trust also may be divided by an executor after a decedent's death into two or more separate trusts, with one being a Q-TIP while the other is not.

At the surviving spouse's death, the corpus of a Q-TIP trust is included in the surviving spouse's gross estate. However, the surviving spouse's estate is entitled to reimbursement from the Q-TIP trust for any additional estate tax due because of the inclusion of the Q-TIP property in the estate, unless the surviving spouse affirmatively waives this right to reimbursement.

**Estate Trusts** In this case, trust income may be payable to the surviving spouse or accumulated in the trust at the trustee's discretion. At the surviving spouse's death, trust corpus and any accumulated income are payable to the

<sup>11</sup>As noted in Chapter 26, the federal estate tax return normally must be filed within nine months after a decedent's death, but a 6-month extension often can be secured. Thus, an executor may have up to 15 months after a decedent's death to decide whether to qualify some or all of an otherwise-qualifying trust for Q-TIP marital deduction treatment, depending on the circumstances. This affords significant postmortem planning opportunities and is an important advantage of the Q-TIP trust.

surviving spouse's estate to be distributed, along with the surviving spouse's own probate property, under the terms of his or her will. Estate trusts are used under some circumstances.

**CRT with Spouse as Sole Unitrust or Annuity Trust Beneficiary** When established during a donor's lifetime, charitable remainder trusts (CRTs) can qualify a surviving spouse's remaining lifetime annuity trust or unitrust interest (provided there is no other noncharitable beneficiary) for the marital deduction at the donor's death, as well as provide the lifetime advantages noted in Chapter 19. When CRTs are established at death (under a will), the same can be true, except then they should be compared with a Q-TIP trust, with the charity named as remainderperson, as to which is the most efficient approach.

**Factors in Choice of Method** In terms of planning for the spouse and family, this can be an important decision.

*Control Issues:* Depending on the circumstances, a married estate owner may wish to retain control over the ultimate disposition of marital property after his or her death and after the death of his or her surviving spouse. This may be true because it is a second marriage with children from a prior marriage; out of concern about his or her spouse's money management interests or abilities, or about demands that may be placed on the surviving spouse by others; out of concern about the "dreaded" new spouse, possibly with children of his or her own; or for other reasons.

The only method for qualifying property for the marital deduction that will give the original estate owner such control is the Q-TIP trust.12 With a Q-TIP, the first spouse to die can designate the recipients of the corpus after the surviving spouse's death, or the property can remain in trust for such recipients. The surviving spouse can be limited to a life income interest only in the Q-TIP, although a trustee can be given (but is not required to be given) discretionary power to distribute corpus to the surviving spouse.

On the other hand, from the surviving spouse's viewpoint, he or she would have greatest control over marital property with an outright marital bequest, jointly owned property (although this may present overqualification problems), and outright beneficiary designations.

*Management of Property:* If management of property is desired, a trust is the logical choice.

<sup>12</sup>The CRT with the surviving spouse as sole remaining noncharitable unitrust or annuity trust beneficiary also gives a measure of such control, but in that case the property must go to charity after the surviving spouse's death.

*Creditor and Marital Protection:* Similarly, a trust with a spendthrift clause normally can protect trust corpus from the surviving spouse's creditors. A marital trust also generally would be protected from any marital property claims of a new spouse against the surviving spouse.

*Possible Incapacity of Surviving Spouse:* Again, depending on the circumstances, if the surviving spouse is, or may become, physically or mentally incapacitated, a trust (and probably a Q-TIP trust) seems appropriate.

*Availability of Postmortem Estate Planning:* The Q-TIP trust has an advantage here because, as indicated in Footnote 11 of this chapter, the executor of the estate of the first spouse to die can decide within the time period for filing a timely estate tax return with extensions (which could be as long as 15 months after the first spouse's death) how much, if any, of an otherwise eligible trust contained in a will to elect to qualify for Q-TIP treatment. This allows the executor to make this decision well after the first spouse's death, when circumstances often are much clearer than when the estate planning documents were drafted. This delayed election is only possible under a Q-TIP trust because only it requires an affirmative irrevocable election by the executor to be activated.13

*Flexibility After EGTRRA:* The need for estate planning flexibility after EGTRRA has made the Q-TIP trust even more attractive. The executor can make full, partial, or no Q-TIP election, depending on the circumstances at the time of the estate owner's death.

One technique in this regard is the so-called "single-fund Q-TIP trust." In this case, the will or revocable trust provides that at the death of the estate owner, the entire residuary estate is placed in a single Q-TIPable trust. Then, the executor can make whatever Q-TIP election for a portion, all, or none of this trust, as is appropriate given the circumstances at that time.

#### **How Should the Marital Gift Be Funded?**

This is the final component of a marital deduction strategy. It essentially deals with the type of marital gift to be used. This is a complex area, and a full discussion of it is beyond the scope of this book. Only a brief outline of the issues is presented here.

<sup>13</sup>However, as will be explained in the section entitled "Postmortem Estate Planning," the same kind of adjustment can be made by a surviving spouse through a qualified disclaimer of part or all of a marital interest he or she would have received under a deceased spouse's will or revocable living trust.

**Types of Marital Gifts** There are two basic types of formula marital deduction gifts. One is a *pecuniary amount marital,* where the marital gift is defined as an amount of money (or value of assets to be distributed in kind). The other is a *fractional share marital,* where the marital gift is expressed as a fraction of the estate. The numerator of this fraction is the amount of the marital deduction desired, and the denominator is the value of the assets available for funding the deduction.

**Order of Funding** For pecuniary amount maritals, one approach is for the will or revocable trust to make the *pecuniary bequest or gift to the marital* (i.e., outright to the surviving spouse or to a marital trust), with the residue going to the credit-shelter (bypass) trust or gift. This may be referred to as a *preresiduary marital.* Assuming estate assets are valued at date-of-distribution values, this freezes the amount of the marital gift and protects the surviving spouse from depreciation of asset values from the date of death to the date of distribution. On the other hand, if there is appreciation in asset values between these dates, it results in the appreciation going into the credit-shelter (bypass) trust or gift, which will not be included in the surviving spouse's gross estate at his or her subsequent death. Any such growth goes to the bypass trust or gift.

The other approach is for the will or revocable trust to make the pecuniary bequest or gift to the nonmarital trust or gift (e.g., to the trustee of a trust), with the residue going to the marital gift or trust. This has the reverse effects from those just described. In effect, appreciation or depreciation of asset values from the date of death to the date of distribution goes to the marital. This approach may be called a *reverse pecuniary,* a *residuary marital,* or a *front-end credit-shelter,* among other names.

**Values or Shares in Funding** A pecuniary amount formula can use the following valuation methods for estate assets used to fund the marital gift or bequest. One is a *true-worth pecuniary gift,* in which assets distributed in kind are valued at their date-of-distribution values.14 Thus, for example, one could have a reduce-to-zero, true-worth, pecuniary to the marital formula clause. Another is a *fairly representative approach*, under which assets generally are valued at their federal estate tax values (i.e., their values as of the date of death),

<sup>14</sup>The amount of the marital deduction as reported on the estate tax return is determined as of the date of death based on estate asset values at that time. These are also referred to as the estate tax values of the assets in the estate. But estate assets can appreciate or depreciate in value between the date of death and the date of distribution (i.e., when they are used to fund a marital bequest or trust or a nonmarital bequest or trust), which may be some time from the date of death. This is essentially the issue here.

and the assets used to fund the marital and nonmarital gifts are fairly representative in each case of appreciation and depreciation in their values from the date of death until the date of distribution.15 Finally, there can be a *minimumworth* pecuniary gift or bequest. In this case, each asset is valued for funding purposes at the smaller of its estate tax value or its date-of-distribution value.

On the other hand, a fractional share formula can use two different approaches to funding the marital and nonmarital shares. One is a *pro rata allocation* of assets in which the marital share is allocated a pro rata portion of each asset in the estate. The other is a so-called *pick-and-choose* approach in which a fractional share formula is used but assets can be distributed in whole or in part to the marital and nonmarital shares.

## **Postmortem Estate Planning**

This means, in effect, that an estate plan need not be "cast in concrete" at the time of a decedent's death, but rather, with proper planning, it can be modified in certain respects after death to better fit the circumstances then. Following are some common postmortem planning techniques.

#### **Making the Q-TIP Election**

The need for a decedent's executor to make an affirmative Q-TIP election with respect to an otherwise eligible Q-TIP trust on a timely filed estate tax return in order to effectuate a Q-TIP marital deduction has introduced considerable postdeath flexibility in marital deduction planning, as noted previously.

#### **Use of Qualified Disclaimers**

**General Considerations** The tax law permits persons to give up their rights to property or property interests that they otherwise would be entitled to receive at someone's death by executing a *qualified disclaimer* under the

15This approach arises from the rather well-known IRS Revenue Procedure 64-19. In this Rev. Proc., the IRS addressed the concern that if date-of-death values were used in funding the marital gift, an executor might allocate to the marital gift or trust in a disproportionate manner assets that had declined in value from the date of death to the date of distribution. Thus, the marital gift might effectively be diminished when the surviving spouse died. In a fairly representative approach, however, assets would have to be allocated to the marital gift in a way that represented both appreciation and depreciation in their values since date of death and so the concern would be resolved. When assets are valued at their date-of-distribution values (a true-worth approach), the problem does not exist.

rules of the IRC. Disclaimers can also be used for lifetime gifts and GST tax purposes. When a person makes a valid disclaimer of a property interest, it is treated as though the property was never transferred to him or her (i.e., as if he or she had predeceased the transferor of the property). Thus, the disclaimed property interest goes to whomever or wherever the will or applicable state law indicates should take it if the disclaimant (the person making the disclaimer) had predeceased the decedent.

There are several requirements for a qualified disclaimer for federal transfer tax purposes, as follows:

- N A qualified disclaimer must be a written, irrevocable, and unqualified refusal to accept an interest in property.
- N A qualified disclaimer must be timely. It must be received by the original transferor (or his or her legal representative) no later then nine months after the later of the date the transfer creating the interest in the disclaimant was made or the day on which the disclaimant turns age 21.16
- N There can be no acceptance of the interest or any of its benefits by the disclaimant.
- N The disclaimed property must pass to the surviving spouse or someone other than the disclaimant. The fact that disclaimed property can pass to a surviving spouse (even if he or she is the disclaimant) can be important because it means a spouse can disclaim part or all of the marital bequest, have it pass to a credit-shelter (bypass) trust under the will, and still benefit from the credit-shelter trust (other than having a special power of appointment over the corpus that is not subject to an ascertainable standard).
- N Thus, wills or revocable trusts should have an express provision as to what will happen if a property interest is disclaimed. A disclaimer may be of an entire interest, a partial interest, or a pecuniary amount (a specific dollar amount).

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Ahmed and his wife, Aysha, are in private equity and consulting, and work for different corporations. They have three children. They both would like their estates to pass to the surviving spouse and then to their children in the event of their deaths. However, they want the survivor to be able to make tax-efficient decisions and they are aware of the uncertainties of estate tax legislation.

<sup>16</sup>There are some special rules for disclaimers of jointly owned property, which can be important because jointly owned property can be a source of overqualifying property for the marital deduction.

Therefore, Ahmed and Aysha have executed reciprocal wills in which each leaves everything outright to the other, if living and if the survivor does not disclaim; otherwise, everything goes to a trust for their children in equal shares.

Assume Ahmed dies in 2009 when Aysha is age 56, in good health, and successfully employed. At his death, Ahmed's AGE is \$5,000,000 and Aysha's is \$4,000,000. Since Ahmed's estate is overqualified for the marital deduction and Aysha feels she has adequate resources, she decides to execute a qualified disclaimer within nine months of Ahmed's death to refuse to accept that part of his AGE equal to \$3,500,000. This amount (the applicable exclusion amount in 2009) will go to the trust for their two children under the terms of Ahmed's will (a nonmarital bequest). The remainder, \$1,500,000, will go outright to Aysha as a marital bequest and qualify for the marital deduction. Thus, with the use of a qualified disclaimer, an overqualified estate has been adjusted through postmortem planning into a reduce-to-zero marital.

#### **Allocation of GST Lifetime Exemption**

A decedent's executor may allocate the decedent's unused exemption to lifetime or other transfers. Also, in cases where the GST exemption has not been used or fully used, first-generation heirs (e.g., children with sizeable estates) can disclaim their interests so that they will pass to skip persons (e.g., grandchildren of the decedent) to the extent necessary to make full use of the decedent's exemption. Furthermore, if there is going to be a GST tax, skip persons may disclaim their interests to the extent they exceed the GST exemption.

#### **Choice of Where to Deduct Estate Administration Expenses**

A decedent's executor normally can choose whether to deduct certain estate administration expenses (e.g., executor's commissions, legal fees, and other fees) on the federal estate tax return (for estate tax purposes) or to deduct the expenses on the estate's income tax return (for income tax purposes). Income tax rates are lower than estate tax rates, so this favors an estate tax deduction. However, if a reduce-to-zero formula is used, there will be no estate tax due at the first death, so the effect of an estate tax deduction will be delayed until the second spouse's death, if ever. On the other hand, if a current estate tax is payable, the situation is different. The decision will be based on the facts of each case and the desires of the parties.

## **Alternate Valuation Date**

An executor can choose date-of-death values or the alternate valuation date (six months from date of death) for valuing estate property for federal estate tax purposes. This should be considered if estate values are falling. Refer to Chapter 26 for a discussion on this topic.

## **Other Techniques**

Other techniques, such as special-use valuation of certain real property (see Chapter 26) and selecting a fiscal year for the estate's income tax return, also may be used.

## **Estate Liquidity**

This is the need for cash or assets that can readily be converted into cash to meet the obligations of an estate.

## **Estimating an Estate's Liquidity Needs**

These needs should be estimated for an estate so that planning can include providing the resources to meet them. They may include:

- N Estimated funeral expenses
- N Estimated last illness expenses not covered by health insurance or Medicare
- N Estimated costs of estate administration
- N Current debts
- N Unpaid mortgages
- N Other debts (bank loans, margin or other securities loans, etc.)
- N Federal estate tax
- N State death tax
- N Any specific dollar bequests in the will

The importance of these items will depend on the facts of each case.

## **Providing Estate Liquidity**

Liquidity can be a serious problem for some estates, but of minor importance for others. Much depends on the composition of the estate and what previous

planning has been done. Estate liquidity may be a problem when a large part of an estate consists of relatively unmarketable assets, such as closely held business interests and undeveloped real estate.

Meeting the claims and taxes against an estate generally is the responsibility of the executor, who does this using probate assets. These are the only assets directly available to the executor. However, other assets, such as life insurance proceeds payable to a third-party beneficiary or owned by and payable to an ILIT, that pass outside the probate estate may be made available to the executor by the person or trustee receiving them as a loan to the estate or by purchasing assets from the estate. This is discussed further in Chapter 29.
