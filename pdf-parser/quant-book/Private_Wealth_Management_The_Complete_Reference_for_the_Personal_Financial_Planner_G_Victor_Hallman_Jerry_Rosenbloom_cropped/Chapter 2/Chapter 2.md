This chapter provides an overview of the institutional, economic, and tax environments in which wealth management is carried on.

## **Institutional Environment**

A number of financial institutions provide the products and financial services embraced by private wealth management. These institutions operate in the economy's *capital markets,* in which the available supply of funds is allocated to those who wish to borrow or invest. They act as *financial intermediaries* in that they receive funds from savers and investors and then allocate them to those who want to consume, buy property, or invest in productive enterprises. These institutions include commercial banks; securities and brokerage firms; investment company (mutual fund) organizations; insurance companies; trust companies; credit unions and other thrift institutions; and newer entities, such as hedge funds and private equity firms.

## **Commercial Banks**

**Functions, Purpose, and Federal Deposit Insurance** Commercial banks traditionally have accepted customer deposits and made loans to businesses and consumers. Their deposits include checking accounts (demand deposits), saving accounts, certificates of deposit (time accounts), and money market accounts. Current interest rates on these accounts for a number of banks are reported on the Internet at www.bankrate.com.

These accounts are insured against loss due to the insolvency of the financial institution by the FDIC. For many years, accounts were insured up to \$100,000 for each depositor in each insured bank. However, on October 3, 2008, the *Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008* temporarily increased this basic limit to \$250,000 per depositor per bank, until December 31, 2009. It then is scheduled to return to the former limit. In addition, self-directed retirement accounts, such as individual retirement accounts, are insured by the FDIC up to \$250,000 (which was not changed by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act). The FDIC is an independent agency of the U.S. government, and FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.

A depositor can obtain up to \$250,000 of insurance per bank for single accounts held in any number of insured banks. Furthermore, a depositor might have an account in an insured bank in his or her own name (a single account) and then another account in the same bank in the joint names of the depositor and someone else (a joint account), and each account would be covered by the FDIC up to \$250,000 per depositor. There are other rules for covering accounts held in other ownership categories, such as revocable trust accounts, irrevocable trust accounts, employee benefit plan accounts, and others. Online sites for further information include www2.fdic.gov/edie (for calculating insurance coverage using the FDIC's electronic deposit insurance calculator) and www.fdic.gov/deposit (for information on FDIC insurance).

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Marie Napoli's asset allocation planning calls for her to hold \$400,000 in 12-to-36-month traditional certificates of deposit (CDs). Upon investigation of their respective yields, Marie decides to buy a \$150,000 12-month insured CD in Bank "A," a \$100,000 24-month insured CD in Bank "B," another \$100,000 24-month insured CD in Bank "C," and a \$50,000 36-month insured CD in Bank "D." In addition, Marie and her husband, Paul, have a joint insured checking account in Bank "A" with a \$10,000 balance. Finally, Marie has a \$200,000 IRA account invested in 36-month CDs in Bank "E." As of this writing, all of these accounts would be fully covered by FDIC insurance. However, depending on what happens to the Stabilization Act temporary limit increase, \$50,000 of the 12-month CD in Bank "A" would not be covered under the former \$100,000 basic limit.

Commercial banks also have a unique role in the execution of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. They maintain *reserves* in the form of deposits with the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. The Federal Reserve then conducts monetary policy by affecting the levels of commercial bank reserves.

**Products and Services** As just noted, the traditional services of commercial banks are accepting deposits and making loans. However, in recent years, commercial banks, through their affiliates, now offer a wide variety of other products and services, including brokerage services, investment banking and other securities activities, mutual funds, insurance and annuities, private banking (wealth management services), and others. Commercial banks traditionally have also had trust departments and provided trustee and other fiduciary services.

**Regulation** Commercial banks may be chartered by the federal government and called *national banks*, or chartered by a state, in which case they are called *state banks.* Three federal agencies may regulate commercial banks. The Comptroller of the Currency charters and regulates national banks. Also, all national banks must be members of the Federal Reserve System and hence subject to the regulations of the board of governors of that system. Finally, all member banks of the Federal Reserve System are insured by and subject to the regulations of the board of directors of the FDIC.

State banks are regulated under the banking laws of their respective states. In addition, state banks may elect to join the Federal Reserve System and thus be insured by the FDIC. In this case, they also would be regulated by these two federal agencies.

### **Securities and Brokerage Firms**

**Functions, Purpose, and Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)** These firms provide brokerage services in buying and selling securities, commodities, and the like for their customers, for which they usually charge commissions. In this role, they are also referred to as *broker–dealers*. Securities firms also engage in investment banking in which they originate (underwrite) securities issued by corporations, government bodies, and other entities and then distribute those securities to the investing public. They provide other investment and financial services as well.

Following several sizable brokerage-house failures, in 1970 the *Securities Investor Protection Act* was passed, which created the *Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).* The SIPC is intended to protect customers of SIPC member firms if a firm becomes insolvent and is liquidated under the provisions of the Act. If a member firm is to be liquidated, a trustee is appointed to supervise the liquidation. The trustee attempts to return to customers the securities that can be "specifically identified" as theirs. (Generally, these are fully paid securities in cash accounts and excess margin securities in margin accounts that have been set aside as the property of customers.) SIPC pays any remaining claims of each customer, up to \$500,000, except that claims for cash are limited to \$100,000. In general, customers' securities and cash are covered by the Act. Other kinds of property, such as commodities accounts, are not covered. The SIPC, of course, does not provide any protection to investors against losses from fluctuations in securities prices. The SIPC is funded by the member brokerage firms. In addition, many brokerage firms voluntarily provide private insolvency insurance protection for their customers above the SIPC coverage, up to much higher limits.

**Products and Services** Like commercial banks, securities firms have broadened their offerings to include a wide range of financial products and services, such as mutual funds, insurance and annuities, wealth management services, mortgages and other loans, credit cards, check writing, and others. Some of these firms also operate trust companies. With respect to their brokerage operations, securities firms may be full-service brokers, discount brokers, or exclusively online electronic brokers.

**Regulation** Following the onset of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the federal government enacted several important statutes, which remain the basis of federal securities law today.

*Securities Act of 1933:* The first was the *Securities Act of 1933,* which requires that securities offered for public sale by an issuing company or any person in a control relationship with the company, with some exceptions, must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is done by filing a *registration statement* with the SEC that discloses required material information about the new issue. It also requires that a *prospectus* (a selling document) containing essential information from the registration statement be supplied to purchasers of the new issue. The Act further prohibits misrepresentations, deceit, and other fraudulent acts in the sale of securities (a general antifraud provision).

*Private Placements and Other Exemptions from Registration:* From the viewpoint of private wealth management, an important exception to the registration requirements of the 1933 Act is for private offerings to certain persons or entities who presumably have adequate information or investment sophistication so that they can protect themselves and who do not plan to redistribute the securities—commonly called *private placements.* There is a commonly used safe-harbor rule contained in Rule 506 of Regulation D issued by the SEC that defines the private placement exemption. Under this rule, an issuer can sell securities (in any amount) to an unlimited number of "accredited" investors (for whom no disclosures or sophistication requirements are imposed) and to no more than 35 "nonaccredited" investors (who the issuer reasonably believes have sufficient knowledge and experience to evaluate adequately the investment and who receive specified written disclosures about the securities). *Accredited investors* include individuals who (with their spouse, if applicable) have a net worth of more than \$1 million or who have had and expect to have an annual income of \$200,000 or more, or \$300,000 or more including their spouse. Accredited investors also include institutional investors, key inside persons (such as directors and executive officers of the issuer), certain trusts, and others. The securities issued in a private placement are *restricted securities* and cannot be resold in the public market without SEC registration or complying with another rule exempting them from registration.

Other exemptions from registration include offerings restricted to residents of the state in which the issuing company is located (intrastate offerings); small offerings; offerings by small business investment companies; certain exempt categories of assets, such as U.S. government notes and bonds, state and local government securities, securities issued by banks and regulated savings and loan associations, insurance and annuity policies, and qualified retirement plans; and others. Even if an offering is exempted from registration, the Act's antifraud provisions still apply.

*Securities Exchange Act of 1934:* This was the second basic pillar of federal securities regulation. The 1934 Act, with its many amendments, is wide-ranging and regulates national securities exchanges and trading markets, securities firms and registered representatives, periodic disclosure by public companies, fraudulent and abusive practices, and many other matters. The Act also created the *Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),* which is an independent federal agency charged with administering the federal securities laws.

The Securities Exchange Act requires the registration of national securities exchanges, broker–dealers, and their sales associates with the SEC. However, actual day-to-day regulation of these exchanges, of the over-the-counter market, of broker–dealers, and of registered representatives is mainly done through self-regulation by the firms themselves and private *self-regulatory organizations (SROs)* under the administrative supervision of the SEC.

Because of this rather unique regulatory system, broker–dealers and their registered representatives are subject to a wide range of regulation through the SEC, SROs, court decisions, and federal antifraud rules.1 For example, these securities professionals are subject to several *rules of conduct*, which include the need to know their customers' financial situation, ability, and desire to assume

<sup>1</sup>The 1934 Act defines a *broker* as any person engaged in the regular business of affecting securities transactions for the account of others. A *dealer* is defined as any person engaged in buying or selling securities for his or her own account as part of his or her regular business. Neither definition includes a bank. As noted earlier in Chapter 1, *investment advisers* are regulated by the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

#### **Environment for Wealth Management 33**

risk ("know your customer"); to have reasonable grounds for investment recommendations based on their customers' situation; to know the securities they recommend; to not "churn" (frequent buying and selling of securities for little or no investment reason and mainly to earn commissions) in discretionary customer accounts; to not charge "unreasonable" commissions or markups; and to execute customer orders properly, among others.

*Rule 10b-5 Fraud Actions:* A wide-ranging SEC rule concerning the antifraud provisions of securities law is *Rule 10b-5.* This important rule prohibits any person from engaging in fraudulent activities or making untrue statements of material facts with intent to deceive in connection with securities transactions. Much securities litigation is based on Rule 10b-5.

*Arbitration Agreements:* Securities disputes may be settled through *arbitration,* rather than in the courts, if the parties so agree. As a result, the account agreements between securities firms and their customers routinely contain a provision requiring arbitration of disputes. These arbitration clauses have been enforced by the courts.

*Regulation of Publicly Traded Companies:* The 1934 Act also extends disclosure requirements and substantive securities regulation on an ongoing basis to publicly traded companies. Thus, companies whose securities are listed on an exchange or are traded over the counter and meet certain size requirements must *register their securities* and *file periodic disclosure statements* with the SEC. These are called *reporting companies.* The periodic statements include an annual report (on *Form 10-K* ), quarterly reports, and special reports on certain material events affecting the company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires certain certifying officers of the company (the CEO and CFO) to certify that they have reviewed the annual and quarterly reports and, based on their knowledge, that they are not false or misleading and "fairly represent" the condition of the company. Reporting companies also are subject to other reporting and conduct requirements.

*Insider Trading:* Another important area of regulation in the 1934 Act and other securities law involves *insider trading.* This occurs when a corporate insider who has a duty of confidentiality buys or sells his or her company's securities (or the securities of another company—called "outsider trading") using material, nonpublic information secured from his or her insider status. Insider trading may give rise to Rule 10b-5 liability. Such liability may attach not only to insiders themselves, but also to others who obtain material, nonpublic information due to their relationship with the company (such as lawyers, bankers, and accountants) or who obtain such information from persons who have a duty of confidentiality (such as someone receiving an improper tip). Of course, once information becomes public, there is no insider trading issue.

Other aspects of insider trading are the requirements in Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act for specified insiders to report to the SEC and on the company's Web site their trading in their company's securities, and to pay to the corporation any "short-swing" profits from company securities. Such short-swing profits arise from the purchase and sale of company securities within any six-month period.

*Market Practices:* The 1934 Act also regulates certain *market practices.* For example, the Act prohibits *market manipulation,* which can involve certain activities that intentionally create misleading appearances of market movements in listed securities. Similarly, the Act regulates *issuer repurchases* of a company's own securities. Furthermore, the Exchange Act authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to set *margin requirements* for the extension of credit to purchase securities. The Federal Reserve Board has done so in Regulation T for securities market intermediaries (such as broker–dealers). As of this writing, the initial margin requirement is set at 50 percent. Buying securities on margin is discussed in Chapter 5.

*Other Federal Laws Affecting Investments:* A number of other federal laws deal with securities, investments, and wealth management. Soon after passage of the Securities Act of 1933, the *Glass-Steagall Act* was passed in 1934. Glass-Steagall required the separation of commercial banking and investment banking, and created the FDIC. However, in 1999, this separation was reversed by passage of the *Financial Services Modernization Act (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act),* which repealed this part of Glass-Steagall.

Two important laws were passed in 1940. The *Investment Advisers Act of 1940* has already been described in Chapter 1. The other was the *Investment Company Act of 1940,* which created the regulatory framework for the mutual fund industry. This law is described in more detail later in the chapter in the discussion of investment companies.

Another federal law of note is the *National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996.* This law preempts state securities law in important areas involving "covered securities." This, in large measure, ends dual federal-state regulation for most categories of securities. This law also divides regulation of investment advisers into federal regulation of advisers managing \$25 million or more of client assets and advising registered investment companies, and state regulation of all other advisers.

*State Securities Regulation ("Blue Sky Laws"):* Every state has securities laws that cover subjects such as the offering of securities intrastate, registration of broker–dealers, regulation of investment advisers, and securities antifraud laws.2 State agencies administer these laws. Thus, except for the areas preempted for federal regulation by the National Securities Markets Improvement Act just noted, there is dual federal-state securities regulation.

#### **Investment Companies**

**Functions and Purpose** Investment companies are organizations that gather assets from investors and invest those assets in specified categories of investment media, such as common stocks, preferred stocks, various types of bonds, money market instruments, and other kinds of assets. The investors are shareholders in the investment company. The investment company provides its shareholders with professional investment management or an indexed fund that mirrors a particular market index, diversification over a number of individual securities, convenience and ready marketability of their shares, and the ability to invest reasonable amounts in the fund.

There are four basic types of investment companies. By far, the most important is *mutual funds,* which legally are called "open-end investment companies." These are structured either as corporations or business trusts. Mutual funds do not have their own staff, but instead are operated by separate management companies that serve as a fund's investment adviser, act as the fund's principal underwriter to distribute the fund's shares to the public (as a broker–dealer), and perform other administrative functions for the fund. These management companies have contracts with the funds and may be compensated based on fees expressed as a percentage of a fund's net assets. Mutual funds also have boards of directors who are elected by the shareholders and have responsibility for overseeing the fund's affairs, including approving the contracts between the fund and its management company and other service providers.

Mutual funds are required to redeem their shares at the request of shareholders on a daily basis. This is done at a price equal to the net asset value (NAV) of the shares (in a few cases, less a redemption charge), the value of which is determined at the close of New York Stock Exchange trading normally at 4 p.m. eastern standard time. The funds also normally stand ready to sell shares to investors at the same NAV per share (plus a sales charge in the case of load funds) on a daily basis as of the same time.

Mutual funds can be sponsored by fund management companies, brokerage firms, banks, and insurance companies. These organizations normally sponsor a number of individual funds, called "families of funds." In terms of

<sup>2</sup>The term "blue sky laws" reputedly comes from an old saying that unethical securities dealers sold no more than a piece of the blue sky.

distribution, many funds are sold through third-party sales operations, such as brokers, fund management company sales representatives, banks, insurance agents, and financial planners. Load funds (containing sales charges) are sold in this way because it is necessary to compensate the marketing representative. Some no-load funds (generally containing no sales charges) are also sold in this manner. Other funds are sold directly from the fund itself without a third-party marketing representative. These would include most no-load funds.

The second type of investment company is *exchange-traded funds (ETFs)*. ETFs are like mutual funds except that they are bought and sold by investors on organized exchanges rather than through the funds themselves. Thus, ETFs do not redeem or sell their shares based on their NAVs. The prices of ETFs are determined by supply and demand for their shares in the market, and may differ from the funds' NAVs.3 Also, ETFs are continuously traded during market hours and their prices are determined for each trade, just like other stocks and bonds that are on organized exchanges. Furthermore, ETFs can be bought on margin and sold short. ETFs are bought and sold through brokers, so a commission normally is charged on each trade.

The third type of investment company is the *closed-end fund.* Closed-end funds are corporations with a fixed number of shares that are actively and continuously traded on organized exchanges. Their share prices are determined for each trade based on the supply and demand for their shares in the market. Thus, the prices for closed-end fund shares may be greater (trade at a premium), about the same, or less (trade at a discount) than the funds' NAVs, depending on the market's perceptions concerning a fund's management and prospects. Since they are market traded, closed-end funds can be bought on margin and sold short. Furthermore, many closed-end fund companies use borrowed money to attempt to enhance their investment returns (i.e., are leveraged). This may increase or decrease their returns, depending on market conditions.

The final category is *unit investment trusts (UITs).* This type of investment company holds a fixed portfolio of securities or investments. Units in the trust are then sold to investors. UITs often have a fixed termination date, at which time the unit holders receive a distribution of their proportionate share of the trust's net assets.

**Products and Services** As just noted, the main products of investment companies are pooled, diversified investment funds sold to investors in

<sup>3</sup>As a practical matter, since most ETFs are index funds and not actively managed, their market prices generally should not deviate much from their NAVs.

convenient units. The investment characteristics of mutual funds and other investment companies are discussed in detail in Chapter 8.

Like banks and brokerage firms, some mutual fund management companies have broadened the financial services they offer through subsidiaries or contractual arrangements. These might include sale of insurance and annuity policies, brokerage services, and providing trust services.

**Regulation** The principal federal law regulating investment companies is the *Investment Company Act of 1940.* This law requires investment companies to register with and report to the SEC, maintain proper records, have a majority of independent directors on mutual funds' boards of directors (in most cases), and other matters.

Investment organizations whose investors meet certain requirements are exempt from registering as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and other laws. Such an exemption applies if all the investors are "qualified purchasers." In general, a *qualified purchaser* is any natural person who owns \$5 million or more in investments; certain family-owned entities that own \$5 million or more in investments; certain trusts whose trustees and persons contributing assets to the trust meet any of the previous requirements; and any person who is acting for his or her own account or for other qualified purchasers and who owns, in the aggregate, \$25 million or more in investments.4

Thus, we have now dealt with the concepts of accredited investors (to whom an issuer can sell securities without registration under the 1933 Act and other laws as a private placement) and qualified purchasers (to whom an issuer can sell investments without being classified as an investment company under the 1940 Act and other laws). A significant aspect of these definitions is that hedge fund and private equity fund managers usually restrict sales of their investment interests only to persons and entities that are both "accredited investors" and "qualified purchasers." By so doing, they avoid having to register their offerings under the 1933 Act and other laws, and do not have to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act and other laws. The same restrictions on eligible purchasers also normally apply to sales of private placement life insurance for the same reasons.5

Investment companies also are subject to other federal and state securities laws. They must register public offerings of their securities, such as mutual fund

<sup>4</sup>There is another exemption from registration without limiting sales to "qualified purchasers" that requires a fund not to admit more than 100 investors, but such investors still must meet the definition of an "accredited investor."

<sup>5</sup>Hedge funds, private equity, and other alternative investments are covered in Chapter 8; private placement life insurance is covered in Chapter 21.

shares, under the 1933 Act and deliver a current prospectus to all prospective purchasers. Their principal underwriters and other sales agents are regulated as broker–dealers under the 1934 Act and other laws. Their investment advisers are regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

**Taxation** The tax status of regulated investment companies is dealt with under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC of 1986). To qualify as a regulated investment company (RIC) for tax purposes, a fund must be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a management company, unit investment trust, or certain other entities; at least 90 percent of its gross income must come from investment sources; it must distribute at least 90 percent of its annual investment company taxable income and all of its net taxexempt interest income to its shareholders; and it must meet certain investment diversification requirements. Regulated investment companies are allowed to deduct from their ordinary taxable income and net realized capital gains (entitylevel income) the dividends they pay to their shareholders. As a result, RICs generally distribute all of their earnings each year as dividends to their shareholders and thus avoid corporate-level taxation. The funds' shareholders are then taxed on the dividend distributions they receive as ordinary income dividends, qualified dividends, capital gains, or exempt interest dividends, whichever the case may be. (The taxation of RIC shareholders is described further in Chapter 8.) Thus, RICs serve as a conduit for their shareholders for tax purposes.

### **Insurance Companies**

**Functions, Purpose, and State Guaranty Associations** Insurance companies sell contracts (policies) that financially protect individuals and businesses against many of the perils of life (insurable risks). As a general principle, insurers can effectively insure against these perils because they cover large numbers of insureds (exposure units) and so by employing the principles of probability (including the law of large numbers), they can reasonably and accurately predict their losses on whole groups by insureds. This is the concept of *pooling.*

In the United States, insurance companies generally are divided into life insurance companies (which write life insurance, annuities, and health insurance), property and liability companies (which write personal lines and commercial lines of insurance covering property losses, legal liability claims, and other exposures), health insurers (writing medical expense and other health coverages), and monoline or specialty insurers (such as title insurers and bond insurers).

In terms of organizational and ownership structures, insurers are unique among financial institutions in that there are stock insurance companies, mutual insurance companies, and reciprocal insurance exchanges. Like other for-profit corporations, *stock insurance companies* have stockholders who own the company, elect the board of directors, and are entitled to their proportionate share of any dividends declared by the board on their stock. The stock generally is traded on organized exchanges or markets. *Mutual insurance companies* also are structured as corporations, but they are organized to provide insurance for their policyholders and not for profit. They are like cooperatives. Mutual insurers do not have common stock outstanding or stockholders, but rather are technically owned by their policyholders, who elect the board of directors, may receive policyholder dividends on insurance purchased from the company, and are entitled to their proportionate share of the company's surplus if the mutual insurance company should be converted into a stock insurance company under state law (referred to as *demutualizing*), or in the unlikely event the insurer should be liquidated. *Reciprocal insurance exchanges* are entities of policyholders who technically exchange insurance contracts with each other and share in any cost savings from the insurance operation. Reciprocals resemble mutual insurance companies, but are not structured as corporations. Rather, reciprocals are managed by outside management companies that are referred to as attorneys-in-fact. In life insurance, there are also fraternal companies and benefit societies that sell insurance within religions or other groups to their members.

In terms of distribution systems, most insurance is sold through insurance agents and insurance brokers, who typically are independent businesspersons or corporations. *Insurance agents* legally are agents of one or more insurance companies and have agency contracts with the companies they represent. Independent agents have contracts with a number of insurers, while exclusive agents generally represent only one insurer. *Insurance brokers* legally are agents of their insureds and can secure insurance contracts for them from any one of a number of insurance companies that will accept brokerage business. Both agents and brokers typically are compensated by commissions paid by the insurers with whom they place the policies they have sold. As a practical matter, many insurance marketing persons (often referred to as "producers") act as both agents and brokers, and have agency contracts with some insurers but also place brokerage business with others.

A few large insurance companies sell policies directly to consumers without an agent or broker. This may be done through the Internet or by mail. In addition, insurance may be distributed through securities firms, banks, and investment companies.

Insurers generally have had a good record for financial strength and solvency. However, in recent years, several high-profile insurance companies have become insolvent, so when purchasing insurance or recommending coverage for clients, due diligence must be paid to the financial strength of the insurers being considered. Such due diligence is covered in Chapter 20.

If an insurer should experience financial difficulty, the state insurance regulator normally becomes involved and may take various actions to rehabilitate the insurer. If this is successful, the policyowners are not seriously harmed. However, if rehabilitation is not practical or successful, the regulator will liquidate an insolvent insurer.

In order to protect policyholders, beneficiaries, and claimants of insolvent insurers, every state has enacted some type of guaranty association law. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has created two model statutes: one for life and health insurance and the other for property and liability insurance. The state guaranty association laws are largely based on these model acts, but individual state laws may differ in important respects. These laws generally apply to policyholders of insolvent or impaired insurers who are residents of the state where the insurer is deemed insolvent. However, they apply to life and accident insurance beneficiaries, regardless of their state of residence. The laws have limits on the amounts of insolvency losses they will cover. For example, many state laws cover up to \$300,000 of life insurace death benefits, \$100,000 of life insurance cash values, and \$100,000 of annuity cash values per insured person; various limits on health insurance; and various limits on other insurance coverages.

Benefits paid from state guaranty associations are financed by postinsolvency assessments against the insurers writing the business involved in the state. Thus, there is no advance funding of the associations. In addition, the laws put limits on insurer assessments in a calendar year, such as no more than 2 percent of an insurer's annual premiums on covered business. Assessments can also be limited if they would harm an insurer's ability to carry out its obligations. It can be seen that these state guaranty association plans differ in important respects from the insolvency protection provided by the FDIC and SIPC discussed earlier.6

**Products and Services** Of course, the main products of insurance companies are various insurance policies. In the United States, insurers normally are organized and licensed either as life and health insurers (or only health insurers) or as property and liability insurers, or monoline insurers. However, groups of insurers containing life and health companies and property and liability companies are frequently organized under common ownership.

Like other financial institutions, insurers have broadened the products and services they offer to the public. For example, insurers or groups of insurers might own securities firms, management companies for families of

<sup>6</sup>They also differ materially from the insolvency protection for defined benefit pension plan participants provided by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) discussed in Chapter 13.

mutual funds, investment advisory firms, banks or thrift institutions, trust companies, and other financial services firms.

**Regulation** Insurance companies and their representatives are primarily regulated at the state level through state government departments headed by an official typically called the insurance commissioner, director of insurance, superintendent of insurance, or some similar title. The nature and quality of state insurance regulation varies markedly among the states. Some regulatory coordination among the states is achieved through the *National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).* However, the actions of the NAIC are advisory only and its model laws and regulations only become operative when, and if, they are actually enacted by the individual states.

## **Trust Companies**

Acting as trustees, estate administration and other fiduciary activities may be carried out by individuals (i.e., individual trustees) or corporate trust companies (often referred to as "professional trustees"). An important issue in planning for trusts is whether individual trustees, corporate trustees, or a combination of both should be named as trustee(s). This issue is discussed in Chapter 25.

Most corporate trustees operate as trust departments of commercial banks. However, some corporate trustees operate solely as trust companies. Also, as noted previously, other trust companies may be subsidiaries of securities firms, investment companies, and life insurance companies.

Trust companies generally operate under state law. The trust departments of state banks are regulated under state banking law. The Comptroller of the Currency may authorize national banks to operate trust departments, but they must do so within the confines of state trust law where they are located.

Trust companies perform a number of *fiduciary functions.* Primarily, they act as trustees under various kinds of trusts, in which capacity they invest trust assets, prepare trust tax returns, make discretionary and mandatory distributions to trust beneficiaries, and generally administer the trust according to its terms and state trust law. They also may act as executor or administrator of estates, serve as guardian of property for those not able to act for themselves, act as investment and property managers, serve as registrar of stocks and bonds, and other similar functions.

## **Savings Institutions and Credit Unions**

Savings (thrift) institutions include savings banks and savings and loan (S&L) associations. The primary functions of these institutions are to accept

#### **42 Part I. Introduction**

deposits from the public (such as savings accounts and certificates of deposit) and make loans from those deposits. Their lending traditionally has been primarily for home mortgage loans, but over the years, their lending authority has been expanded to include other types of loans. However, like other financial services organizations, many thrift institutions have broadened their products and services to include insurance sales, mutual funds, trust services, and other financial services.

These institutions may be organized as stock companies (owned by stockholders) or as mutual fund associations (technically owned by their depositors). However, there has been a distinct trend for mutual fund associations to demutualize and become stock companies. Thrift institutions may be chartered by states or by the federal government, in which case they are regulated by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision. Accounts in thrift institutions generally are insured by the FDIC, in which case the institutions themselves also are regulated by the FDIC.

Credit unions are nonprofit organizations that both accept deposits from and make loans to members. The members have some common association with each other, such as working for the same employer, belonging to the same union, belonging to the same fraternal group, and so forth. It is argued that such member associations make loan defaults less likely. The loans may be personal loans, mortgage loans, installment loans, and others.

Credit unions may be state-chartered and regulated by the state or chartered by the federal government and regulated by the National Credit Union Administration. Member accounts usually are insured against insolvency of the credit union, on the same terms that the FDIC insures commercial bank and thrift institution accounts, now up to \$250,000 per account by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, which is a federal agency backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

#### **Deregulation of Financial Institutions and the Financial Services Movement**

Prior to 1999 in the United States, there were various regulatory boundaries between commercial banks and other financial institutions. Perhaps best known was the Banking Act of 1933, commonly called the *Glass-Steagall Act,* which prohibited commercial banks from associating with any business organization that engaged principally in the issue, floatation, underwriting, public sale, or distributions of securities. Furthermore, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and its 1970 Amendments generally limited bank holding companies to activities "closely related" to commercial banking.

This changed in 1999 with passage of the *Financial Services Modernization Act* or *Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.* This law allowed banks and bank holding companies to engage in various financial activities that previously had been denied to them, with some limitations. First, it repealed the securities activities prohibitions on commercial banks in Glass-Steagall. In addition, it created a new type of bank holding company called a *financial holding company,* which has the authority to engage in various financial activities, such as underwriting or dealing in securities, and others. The Act further allowed national banks to have *financial subsidiaries* to engage in many of these financial activities. It also allowed other financial institutions, such as insurance companies, securities firms, and investment companies, to own commercial banks and thrift institutions.

As of this writing, the economy is suffering through a "credit crunch" (and recession), characterized by loan defaults, restricted bank lending, liquidity problems, and potential insolvencies of banks and other financial institutions resulting in massive federal "bailouts." How these developments will affect the regulation of financial institutions remains to be seen.

## **Economic Environment and Wealth Management**

Implicit in any wealth management or financial planning are at least some assumptions as to what the economy may look like in the near and distant future. These assumptions may or may not be explicitly stated, but they are imbedded in the recommendations made and actions taken.

Of course, no one can know what the future may bring. This gives rise to two foundational principles of planning: (1) the need for *caution* in making financial decisions and (2) the desirability of *diversification* in asset allocation and other planning. It also means that a basic understanding of economics is an important backdrop for wealth management.

#### **Microeconomics and Macroeconomics**

The field of economics is broadly divided into two areas: microeconomics and macroeconomics. *Microeconomics* deals with the actions of individuals and firms in purchasing and selling specific products and services. It involves supply, demand, costs, and price considerations for individual products and industries. Price theory (supply and demand) is part of microeconomics.

*Macroeconomics,* in contrast, involves the study of aggregate or "macro" (large) economic forces, such as overall production, economic growth (or decline), employment, money supply, government revenues and expenditures, general price levels (i.e., inflation, deflation, or stable prices), and so forth. Monetary policy and fiscal policy are part of macroeconomics.

#### Supply and Demand—Price Determination

The price paid and quantity sold for a product in any given market are equal to the point where the supply curve and demand curve for the product intersect. This is called the equilibrium price and quantity. In competitive markets, the actual price will tend to move to this price until supply and demand are at the equilibrium price. This is referred to as the law of supply and demand.

This is illustrated in Figure 2.1. The demand curve  $(D_1 D_2)$  slopes downward and to the right, indicating consumers will demand more of a product as its price decreases.

The supply curve  $(S_1, S_2)$  slopes upward and to the right, indicating that firms normally are willing to supply more of a product as its price increases. The equilibrium price and quantity sold in this market are determined at the point where the demand curve  $(D_1, D_2)$  and supply curve  $(S_1, S_2)$  intersect, or at point E. At this point, the equilibrium price is \$3 per unit, 10 million units will be sold, and there will be no unsold units in the market.

The previous discussion assumes competitive markets and is referred to by economists as the *competitive model*. This is considered economically the

![](_page_17_Figure_7.jpeg)

Figure 2.1. Demand and Supply Curves and Market Prices and Quantity Equilibrium

most efficient market structure. In this regard, economists define *perfect competition* as a market structure in which there are many individual buyers and sellers so that no one individual can affect the price paid and quantity sold as determined by the law of supply and demand. Some markets for agricultural products (e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans, etc.) may be examples of this. Properly functioning organized securities exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange and others, also probably come close to this definition.

However, in many other markets, the strict definition of perfect competition does not hold. For example, in a *monopoly,* only one firm supplies the whole market and can determine the quantity supplied and influence the price. A *natural monopoly* exists when it would be inefficient to have two or more firms competing in the same market. Some utilities may be examples of this. In the United States, government regulation is often the way such natural monopolies are controlled.

In many markets, however, there is competition, but it is imperfect. One form of imperfect competition is *oligopoly,* where there is a small number of firms supplying the market; when making moves in the market, they each must be concerned with the reactions of the others. The automobile industry may be an example of oligopoly. The other form of imperfect competition is *monopolistic competition.* Here there are a larger number of firms than in an oligopoly and each firm does not need to be concerned about the market reactions of the others, but each firm is sufficiently differentiated from the others (through product design, advertising, and so forth) so that competition is limited. Many markets probably fit this model.

Price and output determination in monopoly and imperfect competition are different in varying degrees from that just described for the competitive model. In general, under these market structures, the economic results will be less efficient (with a lower amount produced and at higher prices) than under the competitive model.

#### **Behavioral Economics (Behavioral Finance)**

This is a comparatively new field and combines psychology with economics and finance. It is concerned with how people actually make economic decisions and recognizes that their decision-making process may not be entirely "rational," as assumed in the preceding discussion.

Studies in this field have developed a number of concepts, such as the following:

- N Anchoring (use of irrelevant information in decision making)
- N Loss aversion (people are more concerned with avoiding losses than with making gains)

#### **46 Part I. Introduction**

- N Favoring the status quo (a tendency to accept things as they are rather than make changes)
- N Regret theory (people make irrational choices because they fear making wrong ones)

Some of these concepts may help explain certain attitudes clients display in making wealth management decisions. For example, some investors want to continue holding a losing stock that should be sold, hoping that its market price will somehow return to the price they originally paid. This original price is irrelevant to the current investment quality of the stock (an example of anchoring). Also, some investors tend to sell stocks with gains too soon while tending to hold losing stocks too long (loss aversion). An example in the employee benefits field might be the situation where an employer's 401(k) savings plan (see Chapter 13) provides that eligible employees will be automatically enrolled to make elective contributions to the plan (automatic enrollment) unless they affirmatively elect not to do so. Then enrollment in the plan will be greater than if eligible employees initially had to affirmatively elect to participate (an example of the bias in favor of the status quo). (The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows such automatic enrollment for this reason.)

## **Inflation, Deflation, and Stagflation**

The section "Supply and Demand—Price Determination" dealt with the determination of the prices of individual goods and services. In this section, we will deal with changes in overall average prices of many or all goods and services in the economy. Here we will take a macroeconomic view of prices.

**Inflation** *Inflation* is the increase in the general level of prices in the economy. The *inflation rate* is the percentage rate at which the general price level increases from one period to another.

*Price Indexes:* In order to measure inflation (or deflation) in average prices over time, economists construct *price indexes,* which show average weighted price changes in a given "basket," or grouping, of goods and services as compared to their average prices in a selected base period, which is given an index value of 100. An important price index is the *consumer price index (CPI),* which measures the prices of baskets of goods and services assumed to be important to U.S. urban households (retail consumers). The CPI is widely cited as an inflation measure and is used to index a number of tax, benefit, and financial product values for inflation. These include, for example, federal income tax brackets and other tax values, Social Security benefits, some pension benefits (usually for state and local government plans), retirement plan contribution and benefit limits, the federal gift-tax annual exclusion and other transfer tax limits, the changes in values for Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), and I series U.S. savings bonds, among others.

Other commonly used price indexes include the *producer price index (PPI)* and the *gross domestic product (GDP) deflator.* The PPI shows changes in average prices of goods sold by producers. The GDP deflator measures changes in the weighted average prices of all goods and services produced within the United States. It is said to be closely watched by the Federal Reserve authorities for inflationary trends. There also are commodity price indexes. Perhaps the best known is the Reuters Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Futures Price Index, which tracks the prices of 19 commodities.

Rates of inflation, as measured by the CPI, are often cited as both *overall inflation* (sometimes called *headline inflation*) and *core inflation.* Overall inflation considers the prices of all goods and services included in the index. Core inflation excludes items of food and energy from the calculated rates. The theory behind this is that the prices for food and energy are thought to fluctuate considerably from one period to another (i.e., they are volatile) and hence might distort any inflationary trend in the economy. Some believe central banks (like the Federal Reserve) rely more on the core rate in making monetary decisions.

*Economic Effects of Inflation:* Persistent inflation tends to distort economic activity over time. One of the goals of the Federal Reserve is to control inflation (or to keep average inflation "low," depending on one's economic philosophy) through monetary policy.

A major adverse effect of persistent inflation is to reduce over time the real value (value in terms of purchasing power) of assets or benefits expressed in terms of a fixed number of dollars (fixed-dollar assets). These include saving accounts, CDs, currency and checking accounts, nonindexed bonds, and nonindexed pension payments, among others. Economists refer to this loss of purchasing power as an *inflation tax.*

Inflation also adversely affects taxpayers since the U.S. tax system is only partly indexed for inflation (see Chapters 10 and 26 for information on the structure of the tax system). This means inflation causes more income and estate and gift tax values to exceed nonindexed limits and deductions, resulting in greater taxation. A good example is the alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption amount, which is not indexed for inflation.

Consumers are adversely affected when their cost of living increases and their incomes do not keep pace. This is particularly true for persons on a fixed income, such as retirees. Consumers also may be encouraged to increase current consumption beyond normal levels to "beat" future price increases. This, along with the loss of purchasing power of fixed-dollar assets, may discourage aggregate saving in the economy.

Finally, inflation usually results in higher nominal interest rates in the economy. First, bondholders and other lenders will demand higher interest rates to offset the loss of purchasing power in their bonds and other debt securities. In other words, they will seek to maintain an appropriate real interest return on their loans, as discussed in the next section. Second, the Federal Reserve, in fighting inflation (or "excessive" inflation), will act to increase the federal funds rate and the discount rate, which will increase short-term interest rates. Higher interest rates will put a "brake" on economic activity.

Everything considered, it seems that inflation (or perhaps "excessive" inflation) is bad for the economy. One of the objectives of wealth management is to consider the impact of inflation on clients' affairs and to plan for potential purchasing power risk.

*Real versus Nominal Interest Rates and Values: Nominal interest rates*  (or yields) are the periodic percentage dollar returns on bonds (generally the current yield), savings accounts and CDs, and other fixed-dollar type securities without considering inflation. *Real interest rates* (or yields) are such returns minus the current rate of inflation or plus the current rate of deflation (discussed in the next section). For example, if the current yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is 4.5 percent and the current rate of inflation (measured by the CPI) is 3 percent, the real rate of interest on such notes is 1.5 percent [nominal interest rate (4.5%) – rate of inflation (3%) = 1.5% real current yield]. On the other hand, if the current yield on the 10-year note is 2.5 percent and the current rate of deflation is 3 percent, the real rate of interest on the note is 5.5 percent [nominal rate of interest (2.5%) + rate of deflation (3%) = 5.5% real current yield]. It can be seen then that depending on nominal interest rates and inflation rates or deflation rates at any given time in the economy, it is possible to have positive or even negative real rates of return. However, bond investors and other savers normally will seek high enough nominal returns to more than offset the effects of inflation and produce a positive real rate of return.

Other economic values also may be stated in nominal terms or in real terms (adjusted for inflation). For example, comparisons of economic indicators over time, like gross domestic product, may be stated in inflation-adjusted terms in order to compare actual output from one period to another. The prices of commodities, like oil or gold, similarly may be inflation-adjusted for purposes of comparison.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assuming that inflation fears for the economy are rising, the dollar is falling in value relative to other currencies, and interest rates are low, Maria Rodriquez, age 45, is considering investing in gold and perhaps other precious metals for perhaps 5 to 10 percent of her overall asset allocation. (How she can do so is discussed in Chapter 6.) She notes that on March 13, 2008, the price of gold for April delivery on the Comex was \$993.80 per ounce. This was well in excess of the previous peak in the nominal price for gold on January 21, 1980, of \$850 per ounce. Maria wonders then if the current price of gold is at an all-time high. However, when inflation from 1980 to 2008 is considered, the inflation-adjusted price of gold on March 13, 2008, would be \$2,239.67 per ounce in real terms, or more than double the current price.7

#### **Adjusting for Inflation in Planning**

*Future Dollar Amounts:* In several areas of wealth management, we are essentially planning to meet a need for funds many years in the future. Retirement income needs and education needs are examples. Therefore, considering past long-term inflationary trends in our economy, many planners view it as only realistic and prudent to adjust nominal future needs for anticipated future inflation in order to maintain the purchasing power of future funds.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

David Jones, age 50, and his wife Sara, age 48, are engaged in retirement planning. After considering their current expenditures and taxes (using the cash-flow analysis discussed in Chapter 1) and how their outlays might change during retirement, David estimates that he and his wife will need a retirement income of about \$6,000 per month (in today's dollars) when he is 65, in 15 years, when they both plan to retire.

However, in view of past inflationary trends, David and Sara recognize that, to be realistic, their retirement income objective should be adjusted for inflation to maintain the planned-forretirement income's purchasing power. David and Sara, with the help of their wealth management advisers, decide to assume a 3 percent average annual inflation rate for the next 15 years. Given this assumption, \$1 today will be worth only 64.19 cents

<sup>7</sup> See *The Wall Street Journal*, March 14, 2008, p. C1.

in 15 years. This is the present value of \$1 due at the end of 15 years at 3 percent compound average annual interest. (See Table 3.2 in Chapter 3.)

Therefore, to convert their objective of \$6,000 per month in current dollars to a corresponding dollar amount of equal purchasing power 15 years hence, we should divide the \$6,000 per month by the present value of \$1 due at the end of 15 years at 3 percent compound interest (or 0.6419). The result is an inflation-adjusted retirement income objective of \$9,347 (\$6,000 ÷ 0.6419) per month. David and Sara also should consider possible inflation during their retirement years. They might want to plan for a reserve investment fund or account balance, which could be used to provide additional retirement income as needed depending on conditions then. Possible purchase of an immediate life annuity later in life also might be used to make up any future shortfall in needed retirement income. (See Chapter 17 for planning techniques with respect to immediate annuities.)

*Hedges against Inflation:* In their asset allocation planning, investors may attempt to include investments or property that they believe increase in value along with inflation (i.e., are "inflation hedges"). Gold is often thought of in this category. The same also might be said for other physical commodities and property investments whose prices may rise as costs rise in the economy. Some believe real estate is a good hedge against inflation.

It is often suggested that common stocks serve as a "hedge against inflation." However, it seems more logical to say that common stocks tend to perform well during periods of economic prosperity when business profits are rising. Such periods of prosperity may or may not be associated with rising inflation.

As noted earlier, most fixed-dollar investments suffer diminishing purchasing power during inflationary periods and might better be characterized as "deflation hedges." However, some fixed-dollar investments are structured as *inflation-protected securities* and are designed to increase in value during inflationary times. These include TIPS, Series I U.S. savings bonds, and a few CDs and corporate bonds. These are discussed in Chapter 7.

*Deflation:* Deflation is the opposite of inflation and is the decline in the general level of prices in the economy. Deflation has been much less common in the United States than inflation. In fact, as of this writing, there has not been a meaningful deflationary period in the United States since the Great Depression of the 1930s.8 Historically, deflation has been associated with economic depression and banking and credit crises. However, again as of this writing, there is concern by some that the current economic recession could develop into a period of deflation.

*Stagflation:* Some analysts believe there is at least a short-term tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. That is, when economic policymakers pursue policies intended to keep the economy growing and unemployment low (such as monetary policies to reduce interest rates), they must be ready to accept a "reasonable" rate of inflation because of the stimulative effects of their policies. The same is true of fiscal policies discussed later in this chapter.

However, during certain times, there has been both high inflation and high unemployment (no tradeoff). This situation has been dubbed *stagflation.* For example, during the 1970s, the inflation rate averaged more than 7 percent per year, while the unemployment rate averaged more than 6 percent per year.

**United States Experience with Inflation, Deflation, and Stagflation** Since the beginning of World War II, the United States has experienced persistent inflation. In fact, the CPI has increased each year from 1941 through 2007 (except for small declines in 1949 and 1955). During that time, the average annual percentage increase in the CPI was 3.1 percent.

At certain times during this post–World War II period, inflation has been severe. This was true, for example, during much of the 1970s and early 1980s. From 1979 through 1981, the average annual inflation rate was 11.7 percent and reached 13.6 percent in 1980. This period also was characterized by high interest rates as the Federal Reserve sought to rein in this rampant inflation. In 1981, for example, the federal funds rate reached 14 percent and the rate on the then-benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was 16 percent (the highest interest rates in the United States since the Civil War). As noted earlier, this period also included a period of stagflation. For those interested in knowing the impact of inflation over various periods, the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides an inflation calculator online that shows how much it would cost now to purchase goods that cost \$100 at some earlier date. This inflation calculator is at www.bls.gov/cpi.

Also, as noted earlier, there has not been a significant period of deflation in the United States since the Great Depression (particularly 1929 through 1934). However, despite the lack of deflation and depression for many years and the view of some that they cannot recur in the United States, prudent financial

<sup>8</sup>Other countries, however, have experienced significant deflationary periods during this time. In Japan in the 1990s, for example, there was deflation and recession for a number of years following large real estate and other asset price increases (a "bubble") in the previous decade.

#### **52 Part I. Introduction**

planning requires consideration of the possibility that they may, in fact, come again. In view of this uncertainty, it seems wise in asset allocation planning to hold at least some conservative asset classes that will maintain, or perhaps even increase, their values during a severe recession or depression. These might include U.S. Treasury and other high-quality bonds; insured savings accounts, CDs, and money market accounts; conservatively invested money market funds; fixed-dollar cash values in life insurance and annuity policies issued by highly rated insurers; and the like. These might be referred to as "deflation hedges." Again, diversification seems to be the key to prudent planning.

## **Business Cycles**

An economy has fluctuations in overall economic activity. These fluctuations range from *expansions* (prosperity) to a peak in economic activity, from which output begins to decline during the *recession* (depression) phase, until a *trough* occurs, at which time the economy begins a new expansion phase. These periodic fluctuations are called the business cycle. Our economy has always had business cycles. The generally accepted dates for the phases of the business cycle in the United States are set by a private, nonprofit organization: the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). This organization has set these dates from 1854 to the present, and they are available on its Web site at www.nber.org/ cycles.html.

**Expansion (Prosperity)** Expansions (sometimes also called "booms") are periods of growth in real GDP and are often characterized by low unemployment, rising wages, rising values and income from equity-type assets, low insolvencies and credit losses, a rising general price level, and higher interest rates.

**Peaks and Then Recessions** The *peak* is the turning point when the expansion reaches its highest level and the cycle turns toward recession. Unfortunately, no one really knows at the time when this peak has occurred, and there will be differing opinions as to whether a recession has begun.

A *recession* may be said to have occurred when there is a significant decline in economic activity. It is characterized by a reversal of the factors noted previously for an expansion. Recessions traditionally are defined as beginning when real GDP declines for two consecutive quarters, and this has often been true for recessions identified by the NBER. However, in recent years, the Business Cycle Dating Committee has used a broader definition and labeled a recession as "… a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real

#### **Environment for Wealth Management 53**

income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales." A *depression* is generally thought of as a severe (deep) and prolonged recession.

**Trough Leading to a New Expansion** As with peaks, no one really knows at the time when a trough has occurred, the recession is over, and the economy is on the mend. According to the NBER, post–World War II recessions have had relatively short durations (ranging from 6 to 16 months) and have been relatively mild. Expansions, on the other hand, have been longer (ranging from 12 to 120 months), and the overall economy has shown great growth during this time.

**The Business Cycle and Public Policy** It is the public policy of most industrialized countries to use government policies to try to moderate (manage) the business cycle, promote economic stability and growth, and reduce unemployment as much as possible. In the United States, this was the implicit policy of the Roosevelt administration's "New Deal" during the Great Depression. This policy was formally adopted after World War II in the *Full Employment Act of 1946* and the *Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978* (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act). Government actions to do this are in the realm of macroeconomic policy—namely, fiscal policy and monetary policy, which will be discussed later in this chapter.

**Planning Strategies** Blessed indeed would be the hypothetical investor who, over a substantial period, can accurately predict the course of the business cycle. This person would sell their equities and buy high-grade bonds and accumulate cash at the peak and do the reverse at the trough. Such an investor almost certainly does not exist—at least your authors do not claim this kind of clairvoyance.

While there are a number of theories, economists really do not know what causes the business cycle and cannot predict in advance when its phases will occur. There almost always is disagreement and controversy at the time among economists, government officials, and investment professionals as to whether the economy is going into a recession or is recovering from one (i.e., when the peaks and troughs have occurred). As an extreme example, in the first few months of the Great Depression in 1929, some government officials and investment advisers were telling people who wanted to sell their stocks that the economy was "fundamentally sound" and "don't sell America short."

Given the virtual certainty that the business cycle will continue (as it always has in the past), but the uncertainty as to when downturns will occur and how severe they will be, it seems appropriate to repeat the strategy discussed previously. This involves a cautious, diversified asset allocation strategy that contains some secure, guaranteed asset classes that can be counted on during "hard times." Of course, the specific percentage allocations in given situations will depend on the factors discussed in Chapter 9. Also, investors normally will apply their own good judgment and common sense and become more conservative when they perceive the economic storm clouds gathering and perhaps more venturesome when they perceive the economic skies brightening. But that limited amount of market timing should be within the overall strategy of cautious, consistent diversification among asset classes.

## **Monetary and Fiscal Policies**

These are the tools of macroeconomics to attempt to control the business cycle and maintain reasonable price stability.

**Monetary Policy** In the United States, this is the province of the Federal Reserve, which is an independent system created by the *Federal Reserve Act of 1913.*

*Federal Reserve System:* This consists of the 7-member Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., and the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks. The members of the Federal Reserve Board are appointed by the president, subject to Senate confirmation; the president, with the consent of the Senate, also names one of these governors to serve as chairman. The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is the chief official conducting monetary policy. The 12 regional Federal Reserve banks technically are owned by the commercial banks, who are members of the Federal Reserve System and who elect a majority of the directors of the regional banks. The directors appoint the president of each regional bank.

*The Fed and Monetary Policy:* The Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy by affecting the level of market interest rates (in the past, mainly shortterm rates) in the economy and by controlling the money supply.9 In recent years, the Fed's actions have been directed mainly at affecting interest rates rather than at controlling the money supply.

The Federal Reserve affects interest rates (and the money supply) by controlling the *reserves* that member banks have as non-interest-bearing deposits at the regional Federal Reserve banks. Member banks are required

<sup>9</sup>The definition of the money supply in this context includes currency in circulation and demand deposits (checking accounts), which is called M1. The Fed directly affects M1. A more expansive definition is M1 plus savings deposits up to \$100,000 (or \$250,000), money market accounts, money market mutual funds of individuals, CDs, and Eurodollars (U.S. dollars deposited in European banks). This is M2 and is substantially larger than M1. The most expansive measure is M3, which includes M2 plus institutional money market funds, large savings accounts, and some other items.

to maintain such reserves equal to specified percentages of deposits they hold from their customers (their liabilities to their depositors). These are *required reserves.* When a member bank's reserves exceed its required reserves, it has *excess reserves.*

Banks normally lend out these excess reserves on a short-term basis to other banks that need reserves to meet their reserve requirements. This lending and borrowing of excess reserves by commercial banks constitutes the *federal funds market,* and the prevailing interest rate for such funds is the *federal funds rate.* The federal funds rate thus is determined by the supply and demand for funds in the federal funds market, and traditionally has been the only market interest rate the Federal Reserve directly controls through its open market operations (described next). However, other interest rates, particularly short-term rates such as the prime rate, are much affected by the federal funds rate and tend to follow it, so the Fed, in fact, affects the overall level of market interest rates. The *prime rate* is the interest rate commercial banks charge their best business customers for short-term commercial loans. It is higher than the federal funds rate, but in practice moves in tandem with it. A similar rate is *London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),* which is the rate at which English banks lend to each other on a short-term unsecured basis. The prime rate and LIBOR often are used as benchmark rates for indexing other interest rates in the economy. Hence, they are of considerable importance in world credit markets.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Mary Henderson is planning to construct an addition to her residence. The construction cost will be \$100,000. She is considering a fixed-rate mortgage on her home with an interest rate of 6½ percent or an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) with an interest rate of prime plus ¾ of 1 percent. If the prime rate currently is 5 percent, the rate on the ARM will be 5¾ percent and lower than that of the fixed-rate mortgage. But if the prime rate rises to, say, 7 percent, the rate of the ARM will become 7¾ percent and Mary's financing costs will rise above the rate of the fixed-rate mortgage. (Read more on such loans in Chapter 9.)

If member commercial banks need reserves, they can also borrow them on a short-term basis directly from the Federal Reserve. The Fed charges an interest rate on such loans, called the *discount rate,* and requires acceptable collateral. The Fed sets the discount rate and periodically changes it in the face of monetary conditions, but as a practical matter, the Fed affects interest rates primarily through its actions to control the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate and the discount rate move together. Borrowing from the Federal Reserve sometimes is referred to as the Fed's "discount window." Again as a practical matter, historically, commercial banks generally have preferred to borrow needed reserves through the federal funds market rather than from the Fed's "discount window." However, this depends on conditions in the financial (credit) markets.10

*The Federal Reserve's Tools of Monetary Policy:* The Fed may control the level of member bank reserves and hence their ability to expand deposits by making new loans through open market operations, discount rate changes, and changes in member-bank reserve requirements.

*Open market operations.* The most important of these is *open market operations.* Here the Fed buys and sells government securities it holds in the open market through government bond dealers. When the Fed buys securities, it pays for them with funds drawn on itself, which the bond dealers ultimately deposit in commercial banks. The banks, in turn, present these funds to the Fed for payment, and the Fed does so by crediting the commercial banks' reserve accounts with the Fed. This increases member bank reserves. The reverse occurs when the Federal Reserve sells securities. In this case, the bond dealers pay for the securities with funds drawn on commercial banks. The Fed then presents this obligation to the banks for payment and deducts the amount from their reserve accounts. Thus, member bank reserves are reduced when the Fed sells securities in the open market.

These open market operations are planned by the *Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),* which consists of the Board of Governors and five Reserve bank presidents. The FOMC sets a *target rate* for the federal funds rate, and then open market operations are conducted to control the supply of member bank reserves to achieve the target rate. A summary of economic conditions in each Federal Reserve district is prepared for each FOMC meeting to assist in its deliberations. This is referred to as the *Beige Book.* The latest Beige Book can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/beigebook/2008 (with the year being the latest year available). Of course, when interest rates are raised, it will increase the cost of borrowing and reduce inflationary pressures. It will also tend to strengthen the dollar (raise its value relative to that of other currencies) because foreigners may have an incentive to deposit their interest-bearing funds in the United States to take advantage of the higher interest rates relative to those elsewhere. Lower interest rates, on the other

<sup>10</sup>For example, during the "credit crunch" existing as of this writing, commercial banks have increased their borrowing from the Fed. Also, in March 2008, the Fed began for the first time to lend directly to certain investment banks through its temporary, separate primary-dealer credit facility. The Fed also expanded the types of eligible collateral it would accept for its loans (such as mortgage-backed securities and commercial paper). All of this was to provide liquidity (ready cash) for the troubled credit markets.

hand, lower the cost of credit, tend to make loans more available, and provide stimulus to the economy, but may enhance inflationary pressures and weaken the dollar relative to other currencies.

*Discount rate changes.* As noted previously, member banks (and, temporarily, investment banks) may borrow directly from the Fed through its "discount window." The interest rate set by the Fed for these loans is the *discount rate.* When the Fed wants to tighten credit, it raises the discount rate; when it wishes to loosen credit conditions, it lowers the discount rate. Of course, banks may or may not want to borrow from the Federal Reserve.

*Changes in reserve requirements.* The Federal Reserve sets the reserve requirements for member banks. An increase in reserve requirements will reduce credit availability, while a reduction will have the opposite effect. The Fed rarely uses this tool of monetary policy.

*The Federal Reserve as a Lender of Last Resort:* The Fed also is charged with maintaining liquidity (available reserves) in the banking system by serving as a "lender of last resort" for commercial banks. Thus, member banks can meet short-term, emergency needs for cash (like a "run on the bank") by borrowing from the Fed through the discount window.

As noted in Footnote 10, the Fed temporarily extended this lender of last resort concept to investment banks in March 2008 by allowing direct loans to them through a separate credit facility ("lending window"). This was a dramatic and controversial departure from past practice. It may be noted that the Fed does not regulate investment banks as it does commercial banks.

The Federal Reserve also has brokered rescue arrangements for financial institutions (both informally and sometimes formally) when it felt their collapse would harm the overall financial system. This was true, for example, in encouraging banks to provide emergency loans to the hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, in 1998 and in engineering and providing backup funding for the emergency purchase of the investment banking and brokerage firm Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase in 2008.

**Fiscal Policies** These involve the use of *federal government expenditures, borrowing,* and *tax policy* to attempt to stabilize the economy and promote steady economic growth. Such policies are referred to as *discretionary policies* since they are deliberately undertaken by the federal government to control the economy.

When the economy is or appears to be heading toward a recession, it is suggested that increasing government expenditures will expand aggregate demand and stimulate economic activity. However, such increased expenditures (along with declining tax revenues and perhaps tax cuts) will result in greater federal budget deficits and borrowing.

Perhaps the clearest examples of substantially increased government spending to combat a depression were New Deal programs during the Great Depression. During this time, the federal government spent massive sums on roads, schools, parks, rural electrification, huge hydroelectric dams, and other infrastructure projects. Another aspect of such spending was to provide work for the large number of unemployed (as high as 25 percent of the labor force in 1933) through programs such as the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). However, these programs were controversial because some felt they were wasteful, harmful to individual initiative, and not well organized or effective.

In the area of tax policy, when recession exists or threatens, it is argued that cutting tax rates (particularly income tax rates) will expand aggregate demand and thus stimulate the economy.11 Here again, however, the result is higher federal budget deficits and debt, which may cause inflation and higher real interest rates.

In recent years, there have been a number of examples of such tax cutting motivated at least in part by the desire to stimulate the economy. After World War II, the first was the *Kennedy tax cut.* President John F. Kennedy proposed and carried out an income tax rate cut in 1964 to combat what was then viewed as unacceptably high unemployment. Another was the *Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA),* which was President Ronald Reagan's massive tax reduction measure. As its name implies, this law was intended to aid recovery from the severe recession then existing, as well as to further President Reagan's general philosophy of lowering taxes. A similar law was the EGTRRA, which was a tax-cutting and other tax-provisions measure of President George W. Bush intended at least partially to combat the economic weakness at the time.

A recent tax-oriented stimulus measure was the *Economic Stimulus Act of 2008*. This law provided for nontaxable rebate checks in 2008 to lowerincome persons filing a 2007 income tax return. This included persons with

11Tax policy, of course, embraces many other issues than just its role as a part of fiscal policy. Some of these will be discussed in other parts of this book. Another theory related to tax cutting is what some have called "supply side economics." This theory proposes that tax cutting is desirable in and of itself, regardless of fiscal policy. Advocates argue that low tax rates will result in greater investment, expanding businesses and employment, higher income and wealth, and greater economic growth generally. They further argue that while tax rates will decline, total tax revenues will increase due to the economic growth caused by the tax cuts. For examples of this theory, see "Reaganomics 2.0," *The Wall Street Journal,* August 31, 2007, p. A8 and "Tax Cuts Helped Economy Stay Afloat," *Barron's,* July 16, 2007, p. 45. On the other hand, critics of the theory have called it "voodoo economics."

little or no tax liability, including those who otherwise did not have to file a tax return but who had at least \$3,000 of qualifying income.

The most recent stimulus plan is the *American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009*. This law contains a new *Making Work Pay Credit* for 2009 and 2010. This credit is equal to the smaller of 6.2 percent of a taxpayer's earned income or \$800 for joint returns and \$400 for other returns. It is phased out for higher income taxpayers.

On the other hand, during the expansion or prosperity phase of the business cycle, sound fiscal policy calls for reduced government expenditures and raising tax rates to serve as a brake on "excessive" economic expansion and so-called economic bubbles, which, when they "pop," may result in a recession. These actions also will result in reduced federal budget deficits, or even budget surpluses and reduced federal government borrowing. At this time, the Federal Reserve also should be following a monetary policy of raising interest rates for the same reason. This sometimes is referred to as "leaning against the economic wind." Unfortunately, as a practical matter, it seems that it is much easier for politicians to lower taxes and increase government spending than the reverse.12

However, in recent years, there have been examples of more conservative fiscal policies. One was the *Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990* (RRA of 1990). This law was a compromise between a Republican president, George H. W. Bush, and a Democratic Congress, which raised income tax rates to a top rate on ordinary income of 31 percent and also reduced government spending. Another was the Clinton administration's *Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993,* which again raised federal income tax rates on ordinary income to a top rate of 36 percent with a 10 percent surcharge, or a total top rate of 39.6 percent, and also reduced government spending. These deficit-cutting laws and the economic expansion of the late 1980s and 1990s resulted in federal budget surpluses in 1997 through 2000.

*Automatic Stabilizers* In contrast to discretionary policies, these are government expenditures that automatically increase, tax payments that automatically decrease, and benefit payments that remain fixed or increase when the economy turns down. During the expansion phase, the reverse is true.

 For example, during recessions, progressive income tax payments decline proportionally more than income, unemployment benefits increase, welfare

<sup>12</sup>The early foundation for many of these macroeconomic ideas for dealing with the business cycle was first developed by the economist and businessman Sir John Maynard Keynes in his landmark 1936 book, *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money.* These ideas have been called "Keynesian economics," and many credit the beginning of the separate study of macroeconomics to the publication of this book. While Keynesian economics was once quite controversial, its fundamental ideas are generally accepted by most economists today.

benefits increase, Social Security and similar benefits continue unreduced, and bank insurance protects most depositors if banks fail. The opposite occurs during the expansion phase.

**Interventionists versus Noninterventionists** There are differences of opinion among economists concerning the value and effectiveness of government macroeconomic policies in controlling the business cycle and stabilizing the economy.

Probably the most prevalent line of thought is that of the *interventionists* (sometimes called "Neo Keynesians"). They believe that discretionary government policies and automatic stabilizers are effective in the short run in moderating the business cycle.

On the other hand, the *noninterventionists* generally believe that discretionary macroeconomic government policies either are unnecessary (because markets adjust and correct themselves) or are actually harmful (due to uncertainty and delay in implementing the policies and possible disruption of free markets). This probably is the minority view today.

## **Economic Indicators**

There are a number of measures of economic activity that are commonly cited by economists, financial commentators, and others. They are used to measure economic trends and perhaps help predict where the economy may be heading. The following are some examples:

- N *Gross domestic product (GDP)*. This is the overall measure of the value of the final goods and services produced within a country in a given period. When expressed in current dollars (i.e., unadjusted for price changes), it is known as *nominal GDP.* But when it is adjusted for changes in the general level of prices from a given base period, it is called *real GDP.*
- N *Personal income and personal consumption data*.
- N *Various price and cost indexes*. For example, these may include:
  - Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index.
  - Employment Cost Index (ECI), which measures changes in employees' compensation (the cost of labor). Larger-than-normal increases in this index are considered a possible indicator of future inflation.
- N *Money supply*. This includes M1, M2, and M3, as defined in Footnote 9. Large increases in the money supply may also indicate future inflationary trends.
- N *Various stock market indexes and averages*. These measure overall movements in groups of stocks, depending on the particular index or average, including indexes such as Standard & Poor's 500, Russell 2000, Dow Jones

Wilshire 5000, NASDAQ Composite, MSCI, and MSCI EAFE and averages such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, among others.

- N *Commodity price indexes*. For example, the CRB, as discussed previously.
- N *Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report that measures manufacturing activity*. A reading below 50 often is regarded as a recessionary signal.
- N *Manufacturers' new orders (factory orders)*.
- N *Durable goods orders*.
- N *Status of the labor market*. Weekly initial jobless claims, the moving average of such claims, average duration of unemployment, the total number of unemployed, and the average workweek are measures of the status of the labor market.
- N *Status of the housing market*. Pending home sales (for existing homes and new homes), housing starts, inventory of unsold homes, and Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller Home Price Index for 20 large cities are measures of the status of the housing market.
- N *The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index*. This is a monthly index of consumer confidence in terms of how consumers see their own finances and how they view the economy and its future direction. The Conference Board also publishes such a confidence index.
- N *Index of Leading Economic Indicators*. This is a composite index consisting of 10 components, some of which are listed previously. It is widely regarded as an important forecasting tool for estimating the future course of the economy.

## **Tax Environment and Wealth Management**

Tax laws obviously are an important force affecting wealth management, and they are constantly changing. Thus, possible future changes in tax policy may present uncertainties in planning. This has been particularly true in recent years because important tax-cutting and exclusion provisions of EGTRRA, JGTRRA, and other laws are scheduled to "sunset" (i.e., terminate with the former law returning) for years after 2010. However, most commentators believe there will be important tax legislation enacted before this "sunsetting" occurs.

## **Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA)**

EGTRRA of 2001 is an unusual and uncertain piece of tax legislation. This is because many of its original provisions were not effective until years in the future and it contained a "sunset provision" stating that all its terms and provisions will no longer apply after December 31, 2010. In summary, some changes (among others) made by EGTRRA are as follows:

- N Provided for reductions in individual income tax rates. For example, the top rate on ordinary income was reduced from 39.6 percent to 35 percent and a new 10 percent lower bracket was added.
- N Allowed *tax-free* qualified education distributions from qualified tuition programs (Section 529 plans) and education saving accounts (education IRAs). These favorable tax rules for education plans were made permanent (i.e., no sunset) by the Pension Protection Act (PPA) of 2006.
- N Substantially increased contribution and deduction limits for qualified retirement plans, IRAs, and other retirement plans. These also were made permanent by PPA.
- N Provided that all 401(k) plan participants could make all or part of their employee elective contributions as after-tax Roth contributions if the plan permits (i.e., created the Roth 401(k) plan). This also was made permanent by PPA.
- N Increased federal estate tax and GST tax applicable exclusion amounts in stages from 2002 through 2009, provided repeal of the federal estate tax and GST tax entirely in 2010, and provided reinstatement of these taxes as they were in 2001 for 2011 and thereafter. Reduced the top federal estate tax rate (and GST tax rate) in stages from 50 percent to 45 percent.
- N Repealed the step-up in income tax basis at death rule and adopted a modified carryover basis at death rule for 2010 only with reinstatement of the step-up in basis rule for 2011 and thereafter.
- N Separated the gift tax and estate tax exclusion amounts and rates, with the gift tax applicable exclusion amount being kept at \$1,000,000, the gift tax not being repealed in 2010, and the tax rate falling to 35 percent in 2010.

## **Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) of 2003**

This law, along with others, was a further tax-cutting measure. In summary, important changes (among others) made by JGTRRA and other laws are:

N Reduced long-term capital gains tax rates for individuals from 20 percent (top rate) and 10 percent to 15 percent (top rate) and 5 percent, with no capital-gains tax for taxpayers in the 10 and 15 percent income tax brackets for gains realized from 2008 through 2010.

N Reduced the income tax rates on "qualified" dividends received by individuals from a top rate of 35 percent to 15 percent (top rate) and 5 percent, with no tax on "qualified" dividends received by taxpayers in the 10 and 15 percent income tax brackets from 2008 through 2010.

Again, all terms and provisions of JGTRRA of 2003 will terminate (sunset) after December 31, 2010.

### **Sunset Provisions and Planning Strategies**

In order to conform to the so-called Byrd Amendment,13 Congress originally provided that all provisions of EGTRRA would expire on December 31, 2010. At that time, the tax law as it existed in 2001 would again become the law of the land. Congress modified this somewhat in the Pension Protection Act of 2006 by making the education and retirement plan provisions of EGTRRA permanent. Similarly, all provisions of JGTRRA and related laws are to "sunset" after December 31, 2010. Prior law is to return at that point.

These "sunset provisions" obviously create uncertainty in planning. Several possibilities may occur, depending on what the White House and Congress do prior to 2011. They could do nothing and allow the "sunset provisions" to take effect. Most commentators do not believe this will happen. Rather, it is generally believed that sometime before 2011, probably in 2009, new tax legislation will be enacted. It is expected by many that this new legislation will retain the federal estate tax and GST tax (with exclusion accounts retained at the 2009 level of \$3,500,000), retain many provisions of EGTRRA and JGTRRA (but possibly increase the tax rate on capital gains and qualified dividends), retain step-up in basis at death, reduce income tax rates on lower and middle income taxpayers, and enact other provisions.
