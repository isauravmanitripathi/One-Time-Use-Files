# **Valuation Concepts in Wealth Management**

*Competence Objectives for This Chapter* After reading this chapter, planners should understand:

- N Simple and compound interest
- N The future value of a sum
- N Present value concepts
- N Distinction between ordinary annuities and annuities due
- N The future value of annuities
- N Present and future values involving uneven cash flows
- N Internal rates of return
- N Actuarial factors for calculation of present values for annuities, income interests, unitrust interests, remainder interests, and reversionary interests under IRC Section 7520
- N Applicable federal rates (AFRs) for the tax treatment of intrafamily loans and other purposes

A number of concepts concerning how amounts of money may be built up or distributed are important to many aspects of private wealth management. For example, they affect capital accumulation and investment planning, accumulating funds for educational expenses, and accumulating assets for retirement, among others. In addition, the tax law requires the use of certain valuation factors in determining present values for estate planning purposes and for the tax treatment of below-market loans. These concepts will be briefly discussed in this chapter.

# **Capital Accumulation Concepts Simple Interest versus Compound Interest**

*Simple interest* (return) is just the application of an interest rate (or rate of return) to a sum of money for a given period. For example, if an investor buys a \$100,000 one-year certificate of deposit that pays 6 percent interest at the end of the year (i.e., no interest accrued before then), the investor will have \$106,000 at the end of the year (\$100,000 × 1.06 = \$106,000).

On the other hand, *compound interest* (return) involves accumulating (compounding) the interest (or rate of return) on a sum of money at stated intervals (e.g., monthly, semiannually, or annually) over a given time when the interest earned is not paid out currently but instead is added to the fund at the end of each compounding period. In effect, interest is earned on the interest. Stated differently, with compound interest, the sum of money is not growing at a linear rate, as with simple interest, but at a geometric rate. This can produce powerful results when funds are invested at compound rates of return over a substantial period. Simple and compound returns can easily be determined on financial calculators.

# **Future Values**

The *future value* of a sum is the amount to which an investment fund will grow over a certain period at a given rate of return, assuming compounding of returns. Table 3.1 shows the values to which a \$1,000 investment fund will grow at various net rates of return for given periods, assuming annual compounding of returns.

| Percent Annual<br>Net Rate | Number of Years the \$1,000 Is Invested |       |       |       |       |        |        |        |

**Table 3.1.** Values of a \$1,000 investment fund invested for specified numbers of years at various rates of return (future value of a sum)

For example, suppose a person age 35 has \$10,000 to invest. If the *net rate of return* (after investment expenses and income taxes) is only 4 percent, the person can accumulate \$14,800 by age 45, \$21,910 by age 55, and \$32,430 by age 65. But if this net rate of return can be increased to 6 percent (a 50 percent increase in rate of return), the person can accumulate \$17,910 by age 45, \$32,070 by age 55, and \$57,440 by age 65 (or a 77 percent increase in the accumulation for age 65). With an increase of this net return to 10 percent (a 250 percent increase in return), the comparable figures would be \$25,940 by age 45, \$67,720 by age 55, and \$174,490 by age 65 (or a 538 percent increase in the accumulation for age 65). This illustrates the importance of increasing net investment returns when feasible. Such future values can be determined on a financial calculator by solving, for example, for future value (FV) on an HP12C calculator.

We can approach this calculation somewhat differently. If, say, a mother, Mary Smith, with a \$50,000 investment fund, feels she needs approximately \$100,000 in 12 years for her children's education, she can see from Table 3.1 that she will have to earn a net rate of return of about 6 percent on the money to achieve her goal (\$50,000 at 6 percent per year for 12 years = \$100,120). This same result can be determined more accurately by using a financial calculator and solving for interest (i) on an HP12C calculator.

### **Present Values**

Present values are really the reverse of future values. They are the value today of amounts to be received in the future, assuming the amounts will earn given rates of return. Table 3.2 shows the present value of \$1 for different periods at various rates, assuming interest is compounded annually.

| Percent<br>Annual Net         | Number of Years the \$1 Is Discounted |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |

**Table 3.2.** Present values of \$1 at the end of specified numbers of years at various interest (discount) rates (present value of a sum)

Again as an example, suppose John Henry, age 50, estimates he will need approximately \$500,000 in 15 years to assure that he and his wife will have a comfortable retirement. In the current economic climate, John assumes conservatively that he can earn only about a 5 percent net return on investments for this period. He wants to know how much of an investment fund he needs now to meet his goal.

John can estimate this amount by determining the present value of \$500,000 15 years from now, assuming 5 percent compound interest for this period. From Table 3.2, this would be \$500,000 multiplied by 0.4810 (the present value of \$1 at the end of 15 years at 5 percent interest), or \$240,500. This amount may also be determined more easily by using a financial calculator and, for example, solving for present value (PV) on an HP12C calculator.

### **Future Value of Annuities**

As a general definition, an annuity is a stream of periodic payments over a given period. With *annuities certain,* the payments are made, regardless of whether the recipient lives or dies during the period. With *life annuities,* the payments are made only during the lifetime(s) of the annuitant(s) and cease at his or her death or at the death of the last annuitant to die, in the case of joint and survivor annuities. Life annuities are discussed in Chapter 17.

Annuities certain may be ordinary annuities or annuities due. With an *ordinary annuity,* the periodic payments are made at the end of each payment period. With *annuities due,* the payments are made at the beginning of each period. Thus, for annuity payments for a certain period, say, 10 years or 10 payments, an annuity due will produce one more year of compounding interest for the payments at the end of 10 years.

The future value of an ordinary annuity or an annuity due is the amount to which the periodic payments will grow over a certain period at a given rate of return, assuming compounding of returns. Table 3.3 shows the future values of an ordinary annuity compounded annually.

For example, assume a person age 35 can save \$2,400 per year (about \$200 per month). If the person receives a *net* rate of return of 6 percent on the money, he or she can accumulate \$31,632 (1,318 × 24) by age 45, \$88,296 by age 55, and \$189,744 by age 65.

Again, we can approach this calculation in a different way. A person may want to know how much he or she must invest (save) each year in order to reach a desired amount in a given number of years, assuming a certain net annual rate of return. Suppose, for example, a father wants to know how much he needs to invest by the end of each year to produce \$200,000 for

| Percent Annual<br>Net Rate<br>of Return | Number of Years the \$100 Is Invested |       |       |       |       |        |        |        |

**Table 3.3.** Values of a periodic investment of \$100 per year at the end of specified numbers of years at various rates of return (future value of an annuity)

his children's education in 12 years. If he assumes a net rate of return of 5 percent, he can see from Table 3.3 that he will need approximately \$12,563 by the end of each year to produce the \$200,000 in 12 years [(\$200,000 ÷ \$1,592) × 100]. Again, this amount can be determined more easily and accurately by using a financial calculator and solving for payment (PMT) on an HP12C calculator.

A rather dramatic illustration of the power of compounding is presented in Table 3.4. Assume that Mary Jones wants to begin saving \$5,000 per year. The second column shows the result at age 65 if she saves only from age 21 through age 30 and then stops. The third column shows the result at age 65 if she saves \$5,000 per year starting at age 31 (10 years later) until age 65. In both cases, it is assumed she earns a net return of 7 percent on the investment funds. It may be noted that 7 percent is less than the average annual total return over a long period on common stocks, as described in Chapter 4.

Of course, Mary should try to save every year. This table only illustrates the advantage of saving early rather than putting it off. If Mary feels she cannot afford to save in these early years, perhaps her parents or grandparents could make gifts to her (within the gift tax annual exclusion) to enable her to do so. This is a good giving strategy. Perhaps Mary's contributions could be to an earnings-related traditional IRA or Roth IRA, if she is eligible to do so. Then her investment earnings can grow tax deferred or tax free.

return. Table 3.5 shows this for different periods and compounded interest rates for ordinary annuities.

# **Present Values and Future Values for Uneven Cash Flows**

For example, the prices of bonds equal the present value of the future cash flows from the bond. This would be the present value of its interest payments (essentially an ordinary annuity until the bond matures) plus the present value of the face of the bond when it matures. An example of future values would be when a person invests unequal amounts from year to year.

# **Internal Rates of Return**

An internal rate of return (IRR) is simply the annual rate of return on sums of monies starting at the beginning of a period until the end of the period, assuming compounding interest. Stated differently, it is the average annual compound total rate of return on the cash flows from the beginning of the period to the end. This is also called the geometric average rate of return. The distinction between the geometric average and the arithmetic average is presented in Chapter 4.

# **Valuation Factors for Estate Planning and Wealth Transfer**

We will now shift focus and consider various valuation factors used in estate planning, as required by tax law.

# **Actuarial Factors for Present Values of Certain Interests**

A number of estate planning strategies (and other tax needs) require the calculation of the present value for one or more of an annuity interest or an income (or use) interest for a term of years or for life, a unitrust interest, a remainder interest, or a reversionary interest. These strategies are discussed in more detail in subsequent chapters of the book. Some examples, given just to illustrate the valuation issues, are as follows:

- N The creator (grantor) of an irrevocable trust gives property that is expected to appreciate in value to the trust and retains an annuity interest (i.e., a fixed percentage of the original trust property) for a period of years. At the end of that time, any remaining trust property goes to other beneficiaries (remainderpersons). This is referred to as a grantor retained annuity trust (a GRAT) and is discussed in Chapter 27. To determine whether a taxable gift for gift tax purposes has been made when the GRAT was created, and if so, how much, it is necessary to calculate the present value of the retained annuity interest and then subtract this present value from the value of the property given to the GRAT. This determines the present value of any remainder interest given to the other beneficiaries (remainderpersons).
- N The creator (grantor) of an irrevocable trust gives his or her principal residence to the trust, retains the right to live in the residence rent free for a term of years, and retains the right to have the house return (revert) to his or her estate if he or she should die within the period of years. At the end of the term of years, the residence would remain in the trust for the benefit of other beneficiaries (remainderpersons). This is referred to as a qualified personal residence trust (a QPRT) and is discussed in Chapter 27. In this case, to determine the amount of the taxable gift when the QPRT was created, it first is necessary to calculate the present value of the retained use (income) interest for the term of years and the present value of the retained reversionary interest (to the grantor's estate) in the event the grantor should die during the term of years. Then we must subtract the sum of these present values from the value of the residence when it was contributed to the QPRT to determine the present value of the remainder interest given to the other beneficiaries (e.g., the grantor's children as remainderpersons).

N As a final example, the creator (grantor) of an irrevocable charitable trust gives appreciated property to the trust, and retains the right to receive an annuity interest or a unitrust interest (i.e., a percentage of the current value of the trust property each year) for the creator's lifetime and his or her spouse's lifetime. After the last of their deaths, the remaining trust property passes to the designated charity. This is referred to as a charitable remainder trust (a CRT) and is discussed in Chapter 19. In this example, to determine the amount of the federal income tax and gift tax charitable deductions allowed to the creator when the CRT is created, it is necessary to calculate the present actuarial value of their annuity interest or unitrust interest for the remainder of their lifetimes (which, of course, does not go to the charity) and then subtract this present value from the value of the property originally placed in the CRT. This determines the present value of the remainder interest going to the charity (which is a charitable income tax deduction).

The actuarial factors involved in determining such present values are an interest rate at which future values can be discounted and a mortality table for determining life expectancies. Both of these actuarial factors are determined under the rules of Section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code.

**Section 7520 Discount Rate** This is the interest rate the government prescribes for valuing the interests noted at the beginning of this section. It is determined by the IRS, is published monthly in a Revenue Ruling, and applies to gifts made during the month in which it is effective. For charitable deduction purposes, the taxpayer may elect to use the rate for the current month or one of the two preceding months.

The Section 7520 rate equals 120 percent of the federal midterm rate for the month to which it applies.1 In effect, it is the rate the IRS assumes will be earned on the assets producing these interests. As of this writing, the Section 7520 rate was set at 3.4 percent. Of course, the assets in these trusts may actually earn less, but hopefully more, than this Section 7520 rate. The planning techniques described in Chapter 27 are based on the expectation that the actual rate earned will be higher than the applicable Section 7520 rate.

**Section 7520 Mortality Assumption** For the present values of interests affected by the life expectancies of one or more persons, it is necessary to make assumptions as to the probability of persons surviving to each age and correspondingly to the probability of death at each age. This is done through mortality tables,

<sup>1</sup>The federal midterm rate is the AFR, determined on the basis of the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States, with remaining maturities of three to nine years for each calendar month. It is discussed later in this chapter.

which are constructed from statistical studies of survival and death rates for large numbers of people so the statistical law of large numbers can apply.2

Under Section 7520, the IRS also publishes a gender-neutral (unisex) mortality table every 10 years based on census data that is required to be used (along with the Section 7520 discount rate) in calculating the present values of interests when life expectancies are involved. As of this writing, the latest table is Life Table 90CM.

**Tables of IRS Valuation Factors** Section 7520 requires the IRS to publish Valuation Tables showing the actuarial factors to be used in calculating the present values for annuity interests, life interests or interests for a term of years, remainder interests, or reversionary interests.3 The tables reflect the previously described mortality assumptions (for one or two lives) at a series of interest rates (Section 7520 discount rates), from 2.2 percent to 22 percent. The tables must be revised for recent mortality experience at least every 10 years. They also reflect values for terms certain.

The three books of tables are named "Aleph," "Beth," and "Gimel." "Aleph" provides actuarial present-value factors for remainder, income, and annuity interests for one life, two lives, and terms certain. "Beth" provides unitrust remainder factors for one life, two lives, and terms certain. ("Gimel" provides depreciation adjustment factors, which are not relevant here.) The following is just an example of the kinds of factors shown in "Aleph," assuming a person age 50 and 4 percent interest.

These factors, as well as others in the IRS tables, are used for valuing various interests, as noted previously.

**Estate and Financial Planning Software Programs** Several organizations have proprietary software programs that can be used to perform calculations and illustrations for a large number of estate planning and financial planning strategies. These programs incorporate the latest IRS actuarial values just discussed. Many practitioners use such software programs to perform needed calculations and prepare illustrations for their professional activities. The programs are valuable for this purpose.

## **Applicable Federal Rates for Valuing Below-Market Loans**

In the same Revenue Ruling in which the IRS announces the Section 7520 rate each month, it also sets the AFRs for the month. There is a federal shortterm rate (based on the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining maturities of three years or less), a federal mid-term rate (based on a similar calculation for U.S. marketable securities with remaining maturities of at least three years but not more than nine years), and a federal long-term rate (similarly based on average yields on U.S. marketable securities with remaining maturities of more than nine years). The appropriate AFR depends on the term (duration) of the debt instrument under consideration. For example, the interest rate on a demand note would be compared with the short-term AFR, the rate on an eight-year term note with the mid-term AFR, and so forth.

AFRs are used for several purposes, but one is to determine the tax consequences of so-called below-market loans. These are defined in Section 7892(e) of the IRC as *demand loans* when the interest rate (if any) is less than the AFR (short-term rate in this case) and as *term loans* when the amount of the loan is more than the present value of the payments due under the loan (discounted at the appropriate AFR for the term of the loan and compounded semiannually). The tax consequences depend on the nature of the belowmarket loan (e.g., gift loans, compensation-oriented loans, corporationshareholder loans, etc.).

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume that Henry Johnson makes a \$1,000,000 interest-free loan payable in eight years (a term loan) to his son, Peter. The idea is that Peter can invest the \$1,000,000 and keep the investment earnings.

This is an example of a below-market gift loan (i.e., a belowmarket loan where the foregoing of interest is "in the nature of a gift"). In this case, Section 7872(a) provides that the foregone interest (i.e., the difference between the amount that would have been due using the appropriate AFR and the amount actually payable under the loan; here, this is the difference between the amount loaned and the present value of the payments under the loan) is treated (imputed) as a *gift* from the lender (Henry) to the borrower (Peter) and also as a payment of interest by the borrower (Peter) to the lender (Henry) and taxable as interest income to the lender.

To avoid the tax consequences of making below-market loans, the loan should contain an interest rate that is at least equal to the appropriate AFR. Thus, intrafamily loans for wealth transfer purposes normally charge the borrower an interest rate equal to the appropriate AFR. This then becomes the so-called hurdle rate that the yield on the borrower's investment of the borrowed funds must exceed for the strategy to work. This strategy is further discussed in Chapter 27.
