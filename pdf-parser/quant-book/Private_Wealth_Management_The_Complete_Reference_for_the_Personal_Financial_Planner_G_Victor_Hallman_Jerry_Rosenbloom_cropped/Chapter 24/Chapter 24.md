- N Insuring investment properties
- N Covering property held in trust or in other entities

Buying appropriate property and liability insurance is important in planning for personal financial security. This is particularly true for liability insurance, because people in general have become so litigious and claims-conscious.

## **Property Insurance**

There are two basic approaches to insuring property: specified perils coverage and "any risk of loss" coverage (or risks of direct physical loss coverage). *Specified perils coverage* protects against the specific perils (causes of loss) named in the policy. Some common examples include homeowners policies 2, 3 (for personal property), 6, and 8, and certain dwelling forms (such as DP-1 and DP-2).

*Any risk* (also called *open risk*) coverage protects against all the risks or perils that may cause loss to the covered property, except those specifically excluded in the policy. Thus, the exclusions are important in determining the real extent of open risk coverage. This coverage frequently is broader than specified perils coverage, but it also usually costs more. Some common examples of open risk–type coverage are homeowners policy 3, personal articles floater coverage (e.g., on furs, jewels, fine arts, stamp collections, and cameras), and automobile comprehensive physical damage insurance.

#### **Which Coverage and in What Amount?**

The question then becomes, which policies or coverages should be purchased? This often can be decided through an insurance survey of needs conducted by a qualified insurance professional.

Once decisions have been made about types of coverage, the amounts of insurance must be determined. Insureds normally want policy limits (including sublimits) that are adequate to cover losses likely to occur from covered damage to the various kinds of property at risk, including adequate limits to meet any replacement cost provisions in homeowners policies.

## **Personal Liability**

A potentially greater risk is the loss of assets or earnings through the judicial process as a result of one's negligence or other legal liability. Large liability judgments and settlements are commonplace today. When consumers look at their personal liability exposures, the following general categories of exposures come to mind:

- N Ownership, rental, and/or use of automobiles
- N Ownership and/or rental of premises
- N Professional or business activities
- N Directorships or officerships in corporations, credit unions, school boards, and other organizations
- N Employment of others
- N Ownership, rental, or use of watercraft or aircraft
- N Other personal activities

These exposures can be covered by a variety of liability insurance coverages. We shall consider first the comprehensive personal liability coverage, which can be purchased separately, but usually is bought as a part of a homeowners policy.

#### **Comprehensive Personal Liability (CPL) Coverage**

Daily nonbusiness activities include a host of exposures to loss through legal liability. A person's dog bites a neighbor, a visitor trips and falls on the front walk, or a tee shot on the eighth hole slices and hits another golfer—all these accidents could result in liability losses.

CPL insurance (using Liability Coverages–Section II of the homeowners policy for illustrative purposes) agrees to pay on behalf of an insured1 all sums up to the policy limit that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury and property damage. The insurance company also agrees to defend the insured in any suit that would be covered by the policy, even if the suit is groundless, false, or fraudulent. However, the insurer's duty to defend ends when the amount the insurer pays for a settlement or judgement from an occurrence equals the policy's limit of liability. This is an important reason to carry adequate limits of liability.

The previously stated insuring agreement is limited by certain important exclusions.

Coverage, for example, does not apply to:

- N Business or professional pursuits. (Separate liability insurance is available for such exposures, and some insurers endorse limited coverage on their homeowners forms.)
- N Ownership, maintenance, or use of automobiles, larger watercraft, and aircraft. (Separate policies are used to cover each of these exposures.)
- N Injury or damage caused intentionally by the insured. (Some forms of intentional torts can be covered by personal injury coverage that can be purchased through umbrella liability policies discussed elsewhere in this chapter.)
- N Benefits payable under any worker's compensation law.
- N Liability assumed by the insured under any unwritten contract or agreement, or under any business contract or agreement.
- N Damage to property rented to, used by, or in the care of the insured, except for property damage caused by fire, smoke, or explosion; or property owned by an insured; or bodily injury to an insured.
- N Bodily injury or property damage arising from controlled substances, criminal activities, communicable diseases, and certain other activities of insureds.

1The word *insured* includes the named insured and, if residents of his or her household, his or her relatives, and other persons under the age of 21 in their care, and certain students.

In addition to basic liability coverage, CPL insurance covers medical payments and damage to property of others. Medical payments coverage agrees to pay reasonable expenses incurred by persons other than insureds within three years from the date of an accident for necessary medical, surgical, dental, and similar services for each person who sustains bodily injury caused by an accident both while on the insured's premises with permission and elsewhere, if the accident is caused by an insured, a resident employee, or an animal owned by the insured. Note that this provision is not based on the insured's legal liability. Damage to property of others promises to pay under certain conditions for loss of property belonging to others caused by an insured up to a policy limit, again without regard to the legal liability of the insured.

## **Limits of Liability**

CPL insurance provides bodily injury liability and property damage liability coverage on a single-limit basis—which means that one limit of liability, such as \$100,000, \$300,000, or more, applies to each occurrence, regardless of the number of persons injured or the amount of separate property damage. Medical payments coverage is written subject to a per-person limit for each accident.

## **Homeowners Insurance**

When basic property coverage and CPL coverage are added to some other coverages (such as personal theft insurance), or in some cases written on an open perils basis, the resulting package is called a *homeowners policy.*

## **Types of Policies**

There are basically six variations of homeowners policies, as follows.

| Homeowners 2<br>(HO-2) | Provides broad specified perils property coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |  |

| Homeowners 4           | Personal property coverage only (broad form); for                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |
| (HO-4)                 | tenants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |

| Homeowners 6<br>(HO-6) | Personal property and loss-of-use coverage (broad<br>form), and certain dwelling coverage within the<br>unit and for which the unit owner may have<br>insurance responsibility under an association<br>agreement, for condominium and cooperative<br>unit owners. |  |

|              | requirements for other homeowners forms.              |  |

Homeowners policies contain a set of standard coverages that may be altered by endorsements, which can increase the amount of insurance, broaden the coverage, or modify conditions or restrictions. An example of coverages and limits under an HO-3 is as follows.2

|            | Section I Property Coverages                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                          |

#### **Replacement Cost Provision**

The replacement cost provision that applies to Coverages A and B (the dwelling and other structures) is advantageous to the insured because if the proper amount of insurance is maintained, the insured can recover any loss to the

<sup>2</sup>Homeowners policies generally follow this basic pattern, but variations exist in certain states and under the forms used by some insurers.

<sup>3</sup>*Unscheduled* means property owned or used by an insured that is not specifically named or listed in a schedule in the policy. As we shall see later, a person sometimes needs to list certain valuable property in a separate schedule for full coverage.

dwelling and private structures (but not personal property, unless the insured purchases additional coverage providing replacement cost coverage on replaceable personal contents) on the basis of the full cost to repair or replace the damaged property *without any deduction for depreciation.* Without such a provision, the homeowners policy would pay only the actual cash value at the time of the loss of lost or damaged property. Actual cash value (ACV) normally means new replacement cost minus the amount the property has physically depreciated since it was built or was new. Note that property still physically depreciates even though its market value may rise or fall.

However, the insured must carry enough insurance in relation to the value of the dwelling to get the benefit of this replacement cost provision. Specifically, the homeowners policy provides that if the insured carries insurance on a building equal to at least 80 percent of its replacement cost new, any covered loss to the building will be paid to the extent of the full cost to repair or replace the damage without deducting depreciation, up to the policy limit. The policy provides for a lesser recovery if the insurance is less than 80 percent of replacement cost. Therefore, it is important to maintain enough insurance to meet the 80 percent requirement.

Instead of this standard replacement cost provision, however, some homeowners policies may have added to them a replacement or repair cost protection endorsement under which, if the insured allows the insurance company to adjust the coverage A dwelling limit (and the premium) in accordance with a property evaluation the insurer makes, the form will automatically increase the limit of liability on the dwelling to its current replacement cost if there is a loss that exceeds the limit stated in the policy. (There are also corresponding proportionate increases in the limits for Coverages B, C, and D.) In addition, if the insured conforms to the terms of the endorsement, losses to the dwelling and other structures will be paid on a replacement cost basis. This endorsement is valuable since it relieves the insured from estimating the right amount of insurance to meet the standard replacement cost requirements. There is also an additional limit of liability endorsement.

Furthermore, in most states, the insured can buy an inflation guard endorsement on homeowners policies that automatically increases coverage limits periodically by small percentage amounts. Finally, insureds may be able to purchase for an additional premium a personal property replacement cost endorsement that extends replacement cost coverage to personal property (Coverage C) under certain conditions.

#### **Internal Limits (Sublimits)**

Another thing to consider in property and liability insurance planning is the smaller internal limits (called *sublimits*) that apply to certain kinds of property under homeowners policies. Following are some of the more important of these sublimits:

- N \$200 aggregate limit on money, bank notes, bullion, gold other than goldware, silver other than silverware, platinum, coins, and medals
- N \$1,500 aggregate limit on securities, accounts, deeds and similar property, or stamps, including philatelic property (stamp collections)
- N \$1,500 aggregate limit on watercraft, including their trailers, furnishings, equipment, and outboard motors
- N \$1,500 aggregate limit on trailers not used with watercraft
- N \$1,500 aggregate limit for loss by theft of jewelry, watches, precious and semiprecious stones, and furs
- N \$2,500 aggregate limit for loss by theft of firearms
- N \$2,500 aggregate limit for loss by theft of silverware, silver-plated ware, goldware, gold-plated ware, and pewterware
- N \$2,500 aggregate limit on property on the residence premises used primarily for business purposes

The effect of these internal limits may be to make it necessary to schedule additional amounts of insurance on certain property items. This can be done under a *scheduled personal property endorsement* added to the homeowners policy or under a separate *personal articles floater.* Kinds of property that often are separately scheduled and insured include jewelry, furs, cameras, musical instruments, silverware, golfers' equipment, guns, fine arts, stamps, and coins.

### **Liability Exclusions**

Proper planning for personal liability requires analyzing the liability exclusions under homeowners policies and making sure that there are no uncovered exposures. Following are some excluded potential liability exposures that should be reviewed and evaluated:

- N Motor vehicle liability (for which automobile liability insurance should be purchased).
- N Watercraft liability with certain exceptions for smaller cratfs. For excluded watercraft, boat or yacht insurance may be needed.
- N Aircraft or aircraft exposures.
- N Rendering or failing to render professional services.
- N Most business pursuits of an insured.
- N Any premises, other than insured premises, owned by or rented to any insured.
- N Cases where the insured is liable to provide worker's compensation benefits or does provide such benefits.

- N Bodily injury or property damage that is expected or intended by the insured.
- N Bodily injury or property damage arising out of controlled substances.

## **Eligibility**

Form 4 is designed for tenants, while form 6 is for condominium unit owners. Homeowner forms 2, 3, 5, and 8 are intended to cover owner-occupied dwellings. Seasonal dwellings not rented to others are considered owner-occupied.

## **Cost**

Homeowners premiums reflect many factors and can vary among insurers. The policies usually have a deductible applying to losses under property damage coverages, which can be increased for a reduced premium.

## **Automobile Insurance Coverages Provided**

Personal auto policies typically may provide the following coverages.

| Part A | Liability coverage (including bodily injury and property     |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|        | damage liability)                                            |
| Part B | Medical payments coverage                                    |
| Part C | Uninsured motorists coverage (or uninsured/underinsured      |
|        | motorists coverage)                                          |
| Part D | Damage to covered autos (including comprehensive, collision, |
|        | towing and labor, and transportation expenses)               |

About half the states have enacted some form of no-fault auto insurance, which may remove some auto accidents from the realm of negligence liability. Auto policies issued to residents of these states contain the appropriate no-fault endorsement or coverage for that state. These no-fault benefits may be called *personal injury protection* (PIP)*, basic reparations benefits,* or other names. They basically are payable to injured, covered persons by their own insurance company without the covered persons having to show that anyone was negligent in causing their injuries. Depending on state law, the injured persons then may or may not have restrictions placed on their right to sue the negligent motorists who caused their injuries. Some states have adopted what are called choice-type no-fault plans. Under these plans, insured persons can voluntarily relinquish a part of their right to sue in return for reduced auto insurance premiums. This is something to consider as a cost-saving measure for these insureds.

The insuring agreement of the automobile liability policy covers the insured's liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of owned and nonowned automobiles. Commonly used policies, such as the *personal auto policy* (PAP), have a single limit of liability that applies to all covered liability arising out of an accident, regardless of the number of persons injured or the amount of separate property damage.

For example, some sample limits for a PAP might be as follows:

| \$300,000 each occurrence                     | Liability (bodily injury and property damage)                            |

Uninsured motorist coverage generally provides a minimum limit for bodily injury from uninsured and hit-and-run motorists. An insured may also purchase underinsured motorists coverage, which provides coverage in the event another motorist has valid liability insurance but the limits are not sufficient to pay the full amount of the insured's legally recoverable damages against the other motorist up to the underinsured coverage limit.

The next coverages are property insurance (technically called *physical damage* coverage) on the insured's own car. *Other than collision* (or comprehensive) provides broad open perils coverage except for collision. Recovery is made on an actual cash-value basis. *Collision* also is written on an actual cash-value basis. A deductible(s) normally applies to both collision and comprehensive coverages. Finally, in the illustrative limits cited here, the policy contains a mandatory state no-fault endorsement. This would not be so in states that do not have automobile no-fault laws (although they might provide out-of-state no-fault coverage).

#### **Persons Insured**

Under the PAP, the following are considered to be a "covered person" as far as liability coverage is concerned:

N The "named insured" (i.e., the person named in the policy declarations), his or her spouse if a resident of the same household, and any family member (i.e., a person related to the named insured or spouse by blood, marriage, or adoption and a resident of the insured's household) with respect to the ownership, maintenance, or use of any auto or trailer

#### **570 Part VII. Insurance Planning and Risk Management**

- N Any person using the insured's covered auto
- N Any other person or organization with regard to the insured's covered auto, but only for their legal responsibility for the acts or omissions of a person for whom coverage otherwise is provided under the liability part of the policy
- N Any other person or organization with regard to any auto other than the insured's covered auto, but only for their legal responsibility for the acts or omissions of the named insured, his or her spouse, and any family member covered under the liability part of the policy

This can be generally summed up by saying that the auto insurance follows the insured and a covered auto.

As always, exclusions are important in defining the coverage of an insurance contract. The following are some of the important liability exclusions of the PAP:

- N Damage to property owned or being transported by a covered person.
- N Damage to property rented to, used by, or in the care of a covered person.
- N Bodily injury to an employee of a covered person during the course of employment; however, this exclusion does not apply to a domestic employee, unless worker's compensation benefits are required for or made available for that employee.
- N Liability arising out of the ownership or operation of a vehicle while it is being used to carry persons or property for a fee; however, this exclusion does not apply to normal share-the-expense carpools.
- N The ownership, maintenance, or use of a motorcycle or other selfpropelled vehicle having fewer than four wheels. (Additional liability coverage is needed for this kind of exposure.)
- N The ownership, maintenance, or use of any vehicle, other than the insured's covered autos, that is owned by or furnished or available for the regular use of the named insured or his or her spouse.
- N The ownership, maintenance, or use of any vehicle, other than the insured's covered autos, that is owned by or furnished or available for the regular use of any family member; however, this exclusion does not apply to the named insured or his or her spouse.
- N Any person using a vehicle without a reasonable belief that the person is entitled to do so.

#### **Cost**

The rating of automobile liability insurance generally is based on four factors: age and perhaps sex of drivers, use of the auto, territory where the car is garaged, and the operators' driving records. Auto physical damage rates generally are affected by such factors as the cost (new) of the car and its age. As the years go by, the actual cash value of a car diminishes through depreciation, and thus the physical damage premium also declines. However, at some point in the life of a car, it normally is economical for the insured to consider dropping his or her collision (and perhaps comprehensive) coverage. The value left to insure simply is not worth even a reduced premium.

It generally costs relatively little to increase auto liability limits to a more adequate level. There is no simple formula to determine the "correct" limit of liability an insured should carry. The problem, however, generally is best solved by incurring the small cost differential for the higher limits. Of course, the problem also can be solved by carrying an adequate excess or umbrella liability policy, described later in this chapter.

The cost of automobile insurance can vary considerably among insurance companies. Thus, consumers or their advisers may secure significant savings by shopping around for their automobile insurance. Of course, as explained in Chapter 20, cost is not the only factor that should be considered. In the area of physical damage insurance, one major cost-cutting technique that often is not utilized fully is the use of higher deductibles.

#### **Variations in Policies**

Up to this point, we have been talking about the PAP. Many individuals and families are covered by the PAP. However, some insurers (including some large ones) use their own forms of automobile insurance policies.

In addition, other kinds of automobile policies are used, each serving its own purpose. For example, a *business auto coverage form* is the most widely used form to insure commercial vehicles.

## **Other Property and Liability Policies to Consider Personal Excess (Umbrella) Liability**

The desire of individuals for higher liability limits and broader protection inspired the creation of the personal excess liability, catastrophe liability, or umbrella contract. It is "excess" insurance, and so underlying liability policies, such as automobile and homeowners policies, are required. Many personal umbrella policies are issued with a minimum limit of \$1 million, but higher limits are available. In fact, some insurers are willing to write very high limits for persons of high net worth.

#### **572 Part VII. Insurance Planning and Risk Management**

Personal umbrella policies are issued by many insurers, but they are not standardized. The umbrella policy is designed to pay and defend liability claims after the limits of underlying liability policies are exhausted. For example, suppose John Doe is involved in an auto accident and, as the result of his negligence, Richard Roe is seriously injured. A jury finds John liable to Richard for damages of \$500,000. John's automobile policy, written with a single limit of \$300,000, which John thought was "more than adequate," pays its limit of \$300,000. Unfortunately, John remains personally liable for the remaining \$200,000. However, if John had purchased a personal umbrella policy with, say, a \$1 million limit, this excess policy would have paid the \$200,000 on his behalf.

In addition, personal umbrella policies are written on a broad coverage basis. This results in some important extensions of coverage, such as:

- N Property damage liability for loss of property of others in the insured's care, custody, or control
- N Worldwide coverage (no territorial restriction)
- N Coverage of specified personal injury claims, which might include libel, slander, false arrest, wrongful entry, invasion of privacy, malicious prosecution, and the like

Such extensions, which are not covered by the underlying liability policies, are subject to a deductible (called a *self-insured retention* or SIR) that might be \$250 or more.

Most people, whether they think of themselves as well off or not, should consider buying personal umbrella liability insurance. While the likelihood of a catastrophic liability loss is small, if it did happen, it would financially destroy the person involved. That is not a risk people can afford to take. Furthermore, the premium is not burdensome. Also, a personal umbrella policy may require underlying liability insurance with lower limits than the insured now is carrying. Thus, the insured may be able to reduce some present liability limits and save some premium there.

#### **Directors and Officers Liability**

A trend by the courts of imposing liability on officers and directors of corporations and other organizations in connection with the performance of their duties therein has increased the need for insurance to meet this risk. The Directors and Officers Liability (D&O) policy covers any "wrongful act," which generally is defined as a breach of duty, neglect, error, misstatement, misleading statement, or omission.

For persons serving on various kinds of boards of directors or otherwise subject to this exposure, there is the potential for catastrophic financial loss. This has been particularly true in recent years, with the increased concern over corporate governance. Thus, persons so exposed or invited to serve on boards should inquire into what protection they are afforded by the corporations or organizations involved. Sometimes, the organization agrees to indemnify its directors and then it carries D&O coverage to protect itself; other times, the organization carries D&O coverage that directly covers its directors.

Furthermore, some personal excess (umbrella) liability policies cover insured persons against personal liability for personal injury or property damage arising from their volunteer participation on the board for a not-for-profit corporation or organization.

#### **Professional Liability**

Many professionals and businesspeople need liability coverage to protect themselves against claims and suits arising out of possible or alleged negligence or errors or omissions in the practice of their professions or business pursuits. Such claims and suits are not covered under other personal liability coverages.

Specialized professional liability forms for the various professions and businesses are needed to cover this exposure. Such professional liability policies often are written on a *claims-made* basis. This normally means the event or incident covered must occur after a retroactive date stated in the policy, and a claim arising out of the event or incident must be made and reported to the insurance company during the policy period.

The other kinds of liability insurance policies discussed in this chapter are *occurrence* forms. This means the covered injury or event must occur during the policy period, but claim can be made for it and reported to the insurance company after the policy period ends, as well as during the policy period. Occurrence forms generally are more favorable from the insured's viewpoint than claims-made forms.

#### **Coverage under Business Liability Policies**

Sometimes, executive officers or employees can be sued personally for their activities on behalf of their employer (say, a corporation). It may be alleged that they caused bodily injury, property damage, or personal injury to others. Business liability policies (such as the commercial general liability form) normally broadly define who is insured so as to include executive officers and employees so long as they are acting within the limits of their employment or duties with the employer. If a person feels that he or she may have a business liability exposure, the person or his or her advisers may want to check into the employer's liability coverage.

#### **Worker's Compensation and Other Employment Liability**

All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government have worker's compensation laws, which set forth the benefits payable to employees who suffer on-the-job injuries and occupational diseases. This risk may seem somewhat remote in the context of personal risk management, but certain states include domestic and/or casual employees under their worker's compensation acts. Therefore, depending on the particular state law, a person may need or may voluntarily carry worker's compensation insurance for such employees.

Another area of liability that some individuals, particularly persons of high net worth, possibly could face is employment practices liability. This would involve claims by their employees that they suffered various forms of employment discrimination. Some insurers include employment practices liability coverage in the personal umbrella forms for some insureds.

#### **Investment Properties**

Investment properties a person may own or manage present similar risks of loss to those discussed previously. Because homeowners policies generally are limited to owner-occupants, commercial policies may be used to provide the necessary property and liability protection.

#### **Coverage of Property and Liability Exposures for Properties Held in Trust or by Other Entities**

In the case of high-net-worth clients, it is not unusual for them to have an interest in residences or other properties that are held in trusts, family limited partnerships, or family limited liability companies. A qualified personal residence trust (QPRT), which is discussed in Chapter 27, is an example. In this case, several insurable interests may be involved and should be protected with adequate property and liability insurance. For example, an entity (e.g., a trust) may own the property, but it may be occupied by others with their own contents who may or may not be beneficiaries of the entity. Personal risk management should take care that additional insured endorsements or coverage is provided so that all insurable interests in the property are covered for both property and liability exposures.

#### **Flood Exposure**

Homeowners policies exclude property damage caused by flood or mudslide. In many areas, these can be important exposures. In most cases, the only source of flood and mudslide coverage for individuals is through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). This is a federal program, but the insurance is sold through private insurance agents, brokers, and some insurance companies.

#### **Types of Property and Liability Insurers**

Property and liability insurers sell their products in different ways, and these approaches may have cost implications. In this sense, insurers are independent agency companies (distribution through independent insurance agents or brokers who represent several insurance companies), exclusive agency companies (which distribute their products through agents representing only the one company), and direct writers (distribution through companyemployed salespeople or the mails). In addition, insurers can be classified on the basis of their organizational form as stock insurers, mutual insurers, reciprocal exchanges, and so forth.
