# **Income Tax Reduction and Management Techniques for Individuals**

*Competence Objectives for This Chapter* After reading this chapter, planners should understand:

- N The basic income tax planning techniques
- N Planning sales of securities for tax losses
- N Tax planning for sales of principal residences
- N Techniques for shifting the income tax burden to others
- N Methods for postponing income taxation
- N Taking returns as capital gains and the capital gains lock-in problem
- N Methods for deferring capital gains and dealing with concentrated equity positions

The income tax planning techniques considered in this chapter can be broken down into those that essentially involve (1) tax elimination or reduction; (2) shifting the tax burden to others; (3) allowing wealth to accumulate without current taxation (postponing taxation); (4) taking returns as capital gains; and (5) deferring, and perhaps even eliminating, potential capital gains on appreciated property. Some plans involve a combination of these ideas.

## **Tax Elimination or Reduction**

Techniques aimed at producing income tax deductions, exemptions, and credits that reduce otherwise taxable income (or the tax itself) and techniques that result in nontaxable income or in economic benefits that are not taxable are perhaps the most desirable because they avoid tax altogether. Following are some such techniques.

## **Use of Checklists of Deductions, Exemptions, and Credits**

Many specific income tax deductions, exemptions, and credits are available to taxpayers. Space does not permit discussion of all of them here, but some are mentioned in this and other chapters. Also, there are checklists available from the government and from commercial publishers for the following: items included in gross income; nontaxable income (and other items); deductions to arrive at adjusted gross income; itemized deductions; nondeductible items; other taxes (federal, state, and local); and various taxable or deductible items that apply particularly to certain occupations or businesses.

#### **Use of Proper Filing Status**

A related matter is the choice of the most advantageous filing status. For example, a taxpayer should be sure to claim head of household status or special surviving spouse status if he or she qualifies. Also, although married persons usually file joint returns, they can elect to file separate returns.

## **Receipt of Nontaxable Income**

There are various forms of nontaxable income. Perhaps the most important for many taxpayers is interest paid on most state and local government bonds (as discussed in Chapter 7). However, in order to safeguard their tax break on municipal bonds, investors should watch their borrowing policies. If taxpayers borrow money "to purchase *or carry* tax-exempts," they cannot deduct the investment interest on the loan.

But when is a taxpayer borrowing to buy or carry municipals? In general, if a taxpayer has debt outstanding that is not (1) incurred for purposes of a personal nature (such as a mortgage on real estate held for personal use) or (2) incurred in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business, and if the taxpayer also owns tax-exempt bonds, the IRS may presume the purpose of the indebtedness is to carry the bonds and deny an income tax deduction for the interest on the indebtedness. Suppose, for example, a taxpayer owns debt-free municipal bonds but borrows money to buy common stock on margin. Under these circumstances, the IRS may deny part of the investment interest deduction on the loan, even though the common stock dividends are taxable income.

#### **Nontaxable Employee Benefits**

One of the great advantages of many kinds of employee benefits is that they provide real economic benefits for covered persons; but in many cases, there is no taxable income to the employee on the value of the benefits. In other cases, income taxation is deferred.

Among the employee benefits that provide protection for employees and their families, but that may involve no taxable income for employees, are:

- N Group term life insurance (up to \$50,000 of insurance)
- N Medical expense coverage (except that benefits may reduce otherwise deductible medical and dental expenses if deductions are itemized)
- N Disability income insurance (except that benefits provided through employer contributions are taxable)
- N Noninsured sick-pay plans (again, benefits are taxable)
- N Group accidental death and dismemberment and related plans
- N Dependent care assistance plans (up to \$5,000 per year), educational assistance plans (up to \$5,250 per year), and adoption assistance programs (generally up to \$12,150 per child in 2009).1

## **Planning Sales of Securities for Tax Losses**

This involves using the capital gain and loss rules to the taxpayer's best advantage. We should state at the outset, however, that tax considerations should not outweigh sound investment decisions in buying or selling securities. The tax "tail" should not wag the investment "dog." But in many cases, investors can plan their securities transactions so as to realize tax savings and yet not significantly affect their basic investment decision making.

**Unrealized Capital Losses** Tax savings can take some of the sting out of unrealized investment losses that investors really have, even though they have not actually sold the security. Psychologically, this is hard for some investors to accept. For example, if an investor buys a stock at \$90 per share and over time it falls to, say, \$45 per share, the stock has declined 50 percent in value, and each share actually is worth only \$45 in cash, not \$90. It may never again rise to \$90. Some investors somehow feel they have not really had a loss unless they sell the stock. But this is not true; they really do have the lossâ€”the only question is whether they realize and recognize the loss by selling the stock. From an investment standpoint, investors must consider the investment merits of their securities *at the current prices,* not at what they paid for them.

Thus, investors who have an unrealized loss on a security and are lukewarm on the immediate future performance of the security, or who can make a satisfactory tax exchange (explained later), should seriously consider

<sup>1</sup>The tax advantages of adoption assistance programs are phased out for higher-income taxpayers.

selling the security, realizing the loss, and taking an income tax deduction for it now.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that Mrs. Bailey, who is in the 33 percent income tax bracket, owns a stock she purchased for \$10,000 and which now is worth \$7,000 in the market. She has no capital gains for the year. If she sells this stock now, she will realize a \$3,000 capital loss, which she can deduct from her other ordinary income and save \$990 in taxes (minus selling expenses). Her actual after-tax loss then is \$2,010.

**Tax-Loss Selling** The preceding example illustrates the general concept of *tax-loss selling* of securities (it works with bonds as well as stocks). The following are some ideas on how to maximize tax savings in this area:

- N If investors already have taken capital gains on securities or other property, they can offset these gains by taking losses on other securities they own. Thus, investors can plan the purchase and sales of securities or other capital assets to minimize or even eliminate any taxable capital gains for a given year. Of course, it must be remembered that net capital gains generally are taxed at 15 percent, while other income (which might be offset by capital losses up to \$3,000 per year) may be subject to as high as a 35 percent tax rate.
- N If investors do not have any capital gains in a given year (or enough capital gains to absorb all their capital losses), they can still offset up to \$3,000 per year of otherwise taxable ordinary income (dollar for dollar) with their capital losses. They can also carry any unused capital losses forward to be used in future tax years without any time limitation.
- N Investors can use so-called tax exchanges to enable them to sell a security for a tax loss and yet still keep an investment position in the same field or industry.

In connection with the previous idea, suppose, for example, that Mr. Brown owns a stock in which he has a capital loss that he would like to take now for tax purposes, but he also feels the stock has investment merit for the future and would like to retain it or one like it. So he asks himself, "Why not sell the stock, take my tax loss, and then immediately buy it back again?" The reason is that this would be a *wash sale,* and the loss would be disallowed for tax purposes. The tax law does not recognize losses taken on the sale of securities if the taxpayer acquires, or has entered into an option or contract to acquire, substantially identical securities within 30 days before or after the sale. Therefore, Mr. Brown would have to wait at least 30 days after the sale or else run afoul of the wash sale rule.

#### **Income Tax Reduction and Management Techniques for Individuals 265**

However, when a loss has been disallowed because of the wash sale rule, the security's basis is increased by the disallowed loss. Therefore, if the investor sells the security in the future, the increased basis will result in a smaller gain or a larger loss than would otherwise be the case.

Undaunted, Mr. Brown then asks, "Why not sell the stock to my wife (or other family member), take my tax loss, but still keep the stock within the family?" Unhappily, this will not work either. The tax law disallows all losses on sales within the family (that is, those made directly or indirectly between husband and wife, brothers and sisters, and ancestors and lineal descendants).

Mr. Brown, however, can maintain approximately the same investment position in the field or industry, even for the 30-day period before or after the tax sale, by selling the stock in which he has the loss and then immediately purchasing a different stock of about the same (or perhaps even greater) investment attractiveness. This often is referred to as a tax exchange. Many investment firms maintain lists of suggested tax exchanges to aid investors.

#### **Tax Benefits on Sales of Principal Residences**

For tax purposes, a personal residence is considered a capital asset, but one held for personal use. Therefore, while a gain on the sale of a personal residence is taxable (unless excluded), a loss on the sale of such a residence is not deductible because the loss was not incurred in a trade or business or in connection with a transaction entered into for profit. The same is true for other assets held strictly for personal use, such as cars, boats, airplanes, or furniture.

**Exclusion of Gain from Sale of Principal Residence** However, the tax law does allow relief from the rigor of these rules in connection with gains on the sale or exchange of a residence (including a cooperative apartment, condominium, yacht, or houseboat) that is the taxpayer's principal place of abode. In this case, there is an optional exclusion of gain provision under certain conditions. This provision applies to sales and exchanges after May 6, 1997.2

An individual of any age may exclude from income up to \$250,000 of gain realized on the sale or exchange of a principal residence. To be eligible for this exclusion, the individual must have owned the residence (ownership test) and occupied the residence as a principal residence (use test) for an aggregate of at least two of the five years preceding the sale or exchange. The exclusion applies to only one sale or exchange every two years (frequency test).

<sup>2</sup>This provision was enacted in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and replaces the former rollover-of-gain provision (a nonrecognition provision) of Section 1034 and the former onetime \$125,000 exclusion of gain for taxpayers age 55 and older.

#### **266 Part III. Income Tax Planning**

Married persons of any age filing joint returns may exclude up to \$500,000 of gain from the sale or exchange of a principal residence if (1) either spouse meets the ownership test, (2) both spouses meet the use test, and (3) neither spouse has made a sale or exchange of a principal residence within the last two years (i.e., is ineligible due to the frequency test). However, the \$250,000 exclusion is applied on an individual basis. Therefore, in the case of married persons filing joint returns, if either spouse meets the ownership and use requirements, he or she will be eligible for the \$250,000 exclusion. Also, if an otherwise eligible individual marries a person who has used the exclusion within the last two years, the eligible spouse still can take the \$250,000 exclusion. Of course, once two years have elapsed since the last exclusion was taken by either of them and they are otherwise eligible, the full \$500,000 exclusion applies again. For divorced and separated couples, if one of the spouses or former spouses has met the two-out-of-five-year rule, each spouse or former spouse can exclude up to \$250,000 of gain on sale or exchange of the residence.

To the extent that depreciation was allowable for the rental or business use of a principal residence, after May 6, 1997, the exclusion does not apply and gain will be recognized on the sale of the property. The exclusion may be prorated if a taxpayer does not meet the ownership or use requirements due to a change in place of employment, health, or unforeseen circumstances. Starting in 2010, EGTRRA extends this exclusion to sales by estates, heirs of deceased owners, and qualified revocable trusts.

**Planning Issues** There would appear to be a number of planning opportunities with regard to this provision.

- N Taxpayers can sell appreciated principal residences and move to more expensive ones, less expensive ones, or perhaps to other living arrangements, with no or reduced capital gains.
- N Land next to a principal residence will qualify for the exclusion as long as it is regularly used as part of the residence.
- N If taxpayers have a second home (vacation or rental property), they could sell their principal residence (using the exclusion), move to the second home and convert it to their new principal residence, and then sell that home after two years, again using the exclusion.
- N When an appreciated principal residence is placed in a qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) for estate planning purposes,3 it would appear

<sup>3</sup>A qualified personal residence trust involves the gift of a personal residence by the owner to an irrevocable trust under which the owner (the grantor of the trust) can live in the property for a set period, at the end of which the property passes to the donee(s), often children of the grantor, or continues in trust for the benefit of the donees. This estate planning technique is covered in Chapter 27.

that after the grantor's use period ends, the trust can continue for the donees (often children of the grantor) as a defective grantor trust. Thus, any gain on the sale will be taxable to the grantor and the grantor could avail himself or herself of the exclusion.

N One of the purposes of the exclusion was to eliminate the need for homeowners to maintain records of home improvements (the cost of which would increase their basis for income tax purposes). However, it still may be desirable to maintain such records, because in some cases, the gain might exceed the exclusion, the person may not be eligible for the exclusion, and depreciation may result in gain.

**Conversion to Income-Producing Property** If property held for personal use is converted to property used for the production of income, as when a residence is rented to others, depreciation is allowed as a tax deduction from rental income, and at least part of any capital loss on a subsequent sale of the property is deductible. Thus, if owners of a residence actually rent it, they can treat a loss on its sale as at least a partially deductible capital loss.

The tax status of an inherited residence depends on the use made of it by the person inheriting it. If the new owner does not use it as a residence but immediately attempts to sell or rent it, the property is considered held for profit, and a loss on its sale is a potentially deductible capital loss. The same also is true when two persons own the residence jointly and use it as a personal asset and one of them dies. The tax status of the residence in the hands of the survivor depends on how the survivor then uses it.

## **Making Charitable Contributions**

Charitable giving has become such an important planning technique that a separate chapter is devoted to itâ€”Chapter 19.

# **Shifting the Tax Burden to Others**

Because of the progressive federal income tax structure, it may be attractive tax-wise to shift income or capital gains from persons in higher tax brackets to those in lower brackets. This is normally done within the family.

## **Outright Gifts of Income-Producing Property**

One of the simplest ways of shifting income to others is the outright gift to them of income-producing property. Father gives stock to his adult children, Grandmother gives mutual fund shares to her grandchildren, Mother registers Series EE savings bonds in her children's names, and so on. In general, when a donor gives a donee property, future income from the property is taxable to the donee.

For capital gain purposes, the donee of an appreciated capital asset takes the donor's income tax basis in the property plus any gift tax paid by the donor attributable to the net appreciation in the gift property at the time of the gift. Thus, if Father paid \$5,000 10 years ago for common stock that is now worth \$20,000 and gives the stock to his son, the son's tax basis is \$5,000 (assuming no gift tax resulted). If the son later sells the stock for \$30,000, he will have a capital gain of \$25,000. Thus, the donor (Father) can transfer a potential capital gain to his presumably lower-tax-bracket son, provided the kiddie tax does not apply.

For capital loss purposes, however, different rules apply. In this case, the donee's tax basis is either the donor's basis or the fair market value of the property at the date of the gift, whichever is lower. This means capital losses cannot be transferred to the donee. Therefore, property in which the owner has a sizable paper loss is not desirable gift property from an income taxâ€“saving standpoint. Here, it would be better to sell the property, take the capital loss, and give away other assets.

#### **Gifts of Income-Producing Property in Trust**

Rather than being given outright, property can be given in trustâ€”an irrevocable lifetime (inter vivos) trust. The income taxation of trusts was described in Chapter 10. As explained, depending on the terms of the trust and assuming it is not a grantor trust, trust income generally will be taxed to the beneficiaries if distributed to them, or to the trust itself if accumulated in the trust. Thus, income from property placed in the trust can be shifted in this way. For grantor trusts, income is taxed to the grantor, regardless of to whom it is distributed. Thus, grantor trusts are not income-shifting devices, but since the grantor pays the income tax that otherwise would be paid by the trust beneficiaries or the trust, in effect, this aspect of irrevocable grantor trusts results in additional tax-free gifts (the income tax) to the beneficiaries.

#### **Gifts to Minors**

Income shifting may be one reason for making gifts to minors. However, there usually are other reasons as well. Gifts to minors and the methods of making them are discussed in Chapter 27.

## **Allowing Wealth to Accumulate without Current Taxation and Postponing Taxation**

Postponing taxes can be advantageous for several reasons. Taxpayers may be in a lower tax bracket in the future; their financial circumstances may be better known then; they may get investment returns on the postponed tax; they may not be in a financial position to pay the tax now; and, under some circumstances, the tax may never have to be paid.

## **Tax-Deferred Buildup of Qualified Retirement Plans and IRAs**

Various kinds of qualified retirement plans provided by employers, traditional IRAs, executive compensation plans, and tax-sheltered annuity plans represent important ways by which people postpone taxation. These plans are discussed in Chapters 13, 14, and 15.

#### **Postponing Income Taxation on U.S. Savings Bonds**

Series EE and Series I U.S. savings bonds were described in Chapter 7. Owners of these bonds have a choice as to when they want to be taxed on the increase in value of their bonds. They may elect to report and pay tax on the increase in redemption value as interest each year, or they can take no action and thus postpone paying tax on the increase until the bonds mature or are redeemed. Thus, postponement is the automatic method.

Another possible tax advantage for Series EE and Series I bonds issued after December 31, 1989, is that the accrued interest on such bonds redeemed to finance qualified higher education expenses for the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or the taxpayer's dependents is excluded from the taxpayer's gross income for federal income tax purposes. Qualified higher education expenses include tuition and fees, and the exclusion also applies to redemption proceeds contributed to qualified tuition programs. To qualify, the bonds must be redeemed in the year the qualified higher education expenses are paid; the bonds must be issued in the taxpayer's or the taxpayer's and his or her spouse's name; the taxpayer must be age 24 or older when the bonds were issued; and the taxpayer's filing status must be single, married filing a joint return, head of household, or a qualifying surviving spouse with dependent child. This accrued interest exclusion is phased out between certain income levels (e.g., from \$104,900 to \$134,900 of modified adjusted gross income for married taxpayers filing a joint return and from \$69,950 to \$84,950 for individual taxpayers, indexed for inflation) in 2009.

#### **Selecting the Particular Stock Certificates to Be Sold**

The tax law permits investors to select the particular stock certificates they want to sell, assuming they are going to sell only part of their holdings of a stock. For example, suppose an investor owns 300 shares of a common stock with a present market value of \$50 per share. The stock was acquired over the years as indicated here, and the investor now wishes to sell 100 shares:

> Purchased 100 shares 10 years ago at \$20 per share Purchased 100 shares 3 years ago at \$50 per share Purchased 100 shares 2 years ago at \$60 per share

Thus, depending on which certificates the investor elects to sell, he or she could have a capital gain, no gain or loss, or a capital loss. In the absence of identification as to which certificates are sold, the tax law assumes the first purchased are the first sold (a first-in, first-out concept). It often is good planning for investors to select shares that will minimize their capital gains or produce capital losses.

The same general principle applies to selecting which mutual fund shares are assumed to be redeemed. However, the rules are different and were described in Chapter 8.

#### **Tax-Deferred ("Tax-Free") Buildup of Life Insurance and Deferred Annuity Policy Values**

**Life Insurance Cash Values** These values are not subject to income taxation as they increase year by year but this "inside buildup" is taxed only when the policy or is surrendered for cash, is sold, or in some cases when partial withdrawals are made. Therefore, when planning to take distributions from life insurance cash values, one normally tries to do so without incurring income taxation. This is discussed in Chapter 29.

**Deferred Annuity Cash Values** Similarly, the growth in the policy value of nonqualified deferred annuity contracts is not taxed currently. The income tax is deferred until the owner begins receiving periodic payments from the annuity, surrenders it for cash, takes nonperiodic withdrawals from it, secures loans on it, or the value of the annuity is paid to a beneficiary upon the owner's death. Investment annuities are discussed in Chapter 17.

#### **Installment Sales**

For various kinds of property (other than publicly traded stocks or securities), when the selling price is paid in a tax year after the year of the sale (i.e., in installments), the seller generally pays tax on any gain arising from the sale as the installments are collected rather than in the year the sale is made, unless the seller elects otherwise. This is referred to as the *installment method.* It results in deferring the tax on the uncollected installments and was illustrated in Chapter 6.

# **Taking Returns as Capital Gains**

As explained in Chapter 4, taking returns on directly owned property as capital gains offers distinct tax advantages.

# **Taxation and the Capital Gains Lock-In Problem**

The capital gains tax can produce a situation in which investors feel locked in to a stock or other property because of their investment success. This involves a situation in which investors find themselves (happily, of course) with large paper gains in stocks or other appreciated property and are afraid to sell because they will have to pay sizeable taxes on the capital gains.

This kind of lock-in problem can have several unfortunate effects for investors. Investors' portfolios may become heavily concentrated in the locked-in stock or appreciated property, and diversification may be badly lacking. This may be a particularly severe problem in a declining market. In addition, there may be better investments now than the locked-in stock or property. Furthermore, while the investors' personal situations may have changed and they could use the money, they may be afraid to sell the stock and pay the tax for fear of depriving their children and other heirs of part of their inheritances. Assuming a lock-in problem with respect to directly owned assets, let us briefly review what investors' strategies might be.

#### **Tax Avoidance Strategies**

First, let us consider some strategies investors might use to avoid capital gains taxes altogether.

**Step-Up in Basis at Death** Investors could simply hold appreciated property never sell it during their lifetimeâ€”and upon their death, it currently will get a stepped-up income tax basis equal to its fair market value on that date. Thus, investors could pass the appreciated property on to their heirs free of capital gains tax as of the date of death. However, this means the investor can't diversify if needed and must remain at risk for possible declines in the value of the appreciated property until his or her death.

**Gifts to Charity** As explained in Chapter 19, investors can give some or all of their appreciated property directly to charity, to charitable remainder trusts (CRTs), to pooled income funds, for charitable gift annuities, or in other ways and not realize a capital gain.

**Use of Exclusion Provisions in Tax Law** We have already noted one such exclusion for sales of principal residences. To encourage the formation of small businesses, another is that stockholders (other than C corporations as stockholders) of new, small corporations can exclude 50 percent of any gain on the sale or exchange of their stock. To qualify for this exclusion, the stock must be *qualified small business stock*. This means the stock must be newly issued when the taxpayer acquired it; the stock must be acquired after August 10, 1993; the corporation must have been engaged in an active business for substantially all the time the taxpayer held the stock; and the corporation's gross assets must not have exceeded \$50 million when the stock was issued. Furthermore, the stockholder must have held the stock for more than five years before the sale or exchange. There also is an annual dollar limit per shareholder on the exclusion of \$10 million or 10 times the amount the shareholder paid for the stock, whichever is larger. However, as noted in Chapter 10, 7 percent of the excluded gain is a tax preference item for individual AMT purposes.

## **Tax-Deferral Strategies (Possibly Until Death)**

These are strategies that defer the realization or recognition of capital gains. If the deferral lasts long enough (until death), gain can be avoided entirely because the property gets a stepped-up basis at death (subject to the rules of EGTRRA).

**Like-Kind Exchanges** This nonrecognition provision (Section 1031 of the IRC) was explained in Chapters 6 and 10.

**Tax-Free Corporate Reorganizations** The effects of a tax-free reorganization are that neither the corporation nor its stockholders recognize gain or loss on the exchange (assuming no cash or other property, called *boot,* is received in the transaction) and the stockholders' bases in their old (surrendered) stock or securities are carried over to their new (exchanged for) stock or securities.4

4The IRC provides for seven types of tax-free reorganizations in Section 368. They are (1) statutory merger or consolidation, or Type A; (2) acquiring another corporation's stock, or Type B; (3) acquiring another corporation's property, or Type C; (4) transfer of assets to another corporation, or Type D; (5) recapitalization, or Type E; (6) change in identity, form, or place of organization of one corporation, or Type F; and (7) insolvency reorganization, or Type G. Each of these types has its own characteristics and requirements. Further discussion of them is beyond the scope of this book.

Thus, any gain or loss is deferred and will be recognized if the new stock or securities are later sold in a taxable transaction.

Of course, if the new stock or securities are held until death, they currently will receive a step-up (or step-down) in basis.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose Harry Martinez purchased 500 shares of ABC Technology common stock five years ago for \$10 per share. ABC common has been publicly trading at around \$50 per share. Recently, however, XYZ Technology merged with ABC in a tax-free reorganization and exchanged two of its common shares (with a market value of \$76 for the two) for every share of ABC common. Thus, in this tax-free reorganization, Harry has surrendered his 500 shares of ABC common in exchange for 1,000 shares of XYZ common, has recognized no gain on the exchange, and has a basis of \$5 per share in his new XYZ common (his former basis in ABC of \$10 per share is carried over and allocated to the new stockâ€”two for one in this case). If Harry later sells any of his XYZ common, his capital gain or loss will be the difference between the amount realized (market price minus selling costs) and his basisâ€”\$5 per share. His holding period for his former ABC common will be added (referred to as *tacked* ) to that of the XYZ common to determine the holding period of the XYZ common for capital gain purposes.

#### **ANOTHER CASE EXAMPLE**

Assume that Heather Rosen started a new business, New Computer, six years ago with an initial investment of \$100,000 to develop and market computer software. She organized New Computer as a C corporation, and 100 percent of the common stock (the only class of stock outstanding) was issued to her. She worked extremely hard, developed new products, the business prospered, and now it is valued by outside appraisers (there is no public market) as worth \$10 million on a going-concern basis. However, now that she is wealthy, Heather would like to dispose of her corporation and devote herself entirely to organizing computer education and support programs for disadvantaged youth in her community.

Megacorp Computer Corporation, a large, profitable, publicly traded corporation that pays modest dividends, would like to acquire New Computer for \$10 million. If this is done as a taxfree reorganization, Heather would surrender her 100 percent stock ownership in New Computer in exchange for \$10 million worth of Megacorp common stock, she would recognize no gain on the exchange, and she would have an income tax basis in her Megacorp stock of \$100,000. As a result, Heather would have exchanged her nonmarketable, closely held stock for publicly traded, dividend-paying stock in a major corporation. She can periodically sell part of her Megacorp stock if she needs funds (of course, then recognizing capital gains), or she could use other techniques to avoid the gain as described in this section.

On the other hand, referring back to tax avoidance strategies, it may be noted that Heather's stock in New Corporation is qualified small business stock. Therefore, if she simply sold the stock to Megacorp for cash, she could exclude 50 percent (75% for the stock acquired from 2009 until 2011) of her capital gain (\$10,000,000 amount realized â€“ \$100,000 adjusted basis = \$9,900,000 Ã— 0.5 = \$4,950,000 of excluded gain) for tax purposes. This means the effective tax rate for Heather on the total gain (\$9,900,000) is 7.5 percent (15% Ã— 0.5 = 7.5%). However, 7 percent of the amount excluded is a tax preference for AMT purposes.

**Equity Collars with "Monetizing" the Hedged Stock** This is a sophisticated technique designed to hedge against a decline in the value of appreciated stock, defer capital gain, and then "monetize" the stock by currently receiving cash or its practical equivalent equal to a reasonable percentage of the market value of the hedged stock for other investment.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

Suppose that Homer Kelly has been an executive of the Acme Corporation for 30 years. He now is a senior vice president. Over the years, Homer has invested primarily in his Acme stock through the exercise of stock options, participation in other stock plans, and direct purchases in the open market. The price of Acme stock has shown substantial growth over the years. As a result, the market value of Homer's directly owned Acme stock is now about \$12 million and constitutes more than 90 percent of his assets. His basis in this stock is only \$900,000.

However, Homer is concerned about the lack of diversification in his portfolio and the risk he is running if Acme stock should decline substantially in price. Therefore, he has entered into an *equity collar* around his Acme stock without actually selling the stock. Suppose the current market price of Acme stock is \$70 per share. Homer can establish the equity collar by purchasing, say, a three-year cash-settled put option on Acme stock with a strike price (option price) of \$63 per share and selling, say, a three-year cash-settled call option on Acme stock with a strike price (option price) of \$77 per share.5 The purpose of the put option is to protect (hedge) Homer against a fall in the market price of Acme stock below \$63 per share. On the other hand, the purpose of selling the call option is to receive an income (premium) from the call to offset or perhaps more than offset the cost to Homer of buying the put. Collars can be renewed for successive periods.

Equity collars can be structured in several ways. A common approach is the *zero-outlay collar.* In this case, the premium received from the sale of the call just offsets the cost of the put. Other approaches are the *income-producing* (or *credit premium*) *collar* and the *debit collar.* The value of the underlying stock with an equity collar can be converted into a separate investment fund (monetized) in several ways. For example, the investor could borrow against the stock, subject to margin requirements, and invest the loan proceeds in a separate investment fund. Or, the investor might enter into an investment swap transaction with a securities firm involving a diversified portfolio.

These are complex transactions that may be entered into by persons with large positions in highly appreciated stock. Most of the other techniques that had been used to hedge such positions without actually selling the stock and realizing a large capital gain were eliminated by the constructive sale rules of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Equity collars are still a viable technique, but care should be taken not to run afoul of the broad language of the constructive sale rules.

**Exchange Funds** These are another sophisticated technique for deferring gain on highly appreciated stock. Here, an investor contributes his or her appreciated stock to a limited partnership (the exchange fund) in return for a limited partnership interest in the fund. This contribution to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest is a tax-free exchange, provided not more than 80 percent of the partnership's gross assets are marketable securities. Other investors make similar exchanges, and the partnership builds its desired portfolio. Once established, the fund may be passively managed.

The investor carries over his or her basis in the appreciated stock to his or her partnership interest. If the investor-partner holds his or her partnership interest for at least seven years, the partnership can distribute, tax-free, a portion of its diversified portfolio to the partner (as a distribution in kind of partnership assets). The partnership's basis in those assets generally would be carried over to the distributed assets now in the investor's hands.

<sup>5</sup>The general nature of put options and call options was described in Chapter 6.

Thus, for example, upon liquidation of the investor's partnership interest or termination of the partnership, the investor can receive, tax-free, a diversified portfolio of securities with a carryover income tax basis.

On the other hand, if the investor-partner receives a distribution of partnership assets within seven years, he or she generally will incur a tax liability. Also, since the partnership is a pass-through entity, investment income and capital gains are taxed to the partners, whether distributed to them or not. This is one reason why exchange funds may be passively managed. Exchange funds may not be liquid investments. Investment selection and management are in the hands of fund management and not the individual limited partners. Exchange funds may have front-end loads and have annual management fees.

**Other Investment Products** Some investors use other products and strategies to deal with low-basis, highly appreciated stock. One is the issuance by the investor in a public offering of exchangeable equity-linked notes. This is available only for very large blocks of stock.

Another is the entering into with a securities firm of a prepaid variable forward contract (or variable delivery forward contract). However, the IRS has raised tax questions about these contracts, which has tended to curtail their use. A complete discussion of such strategies is beyond the scope of this book.

**Sales of Stock to an ESOP** Under certain circumstances, the owner of appreciated stock in a closely held corporation can sell part or all of the stock to the corporation's employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) and defer capital gain, possibly until the owner's death. An ESOP is a qualified retirement plan for employees that is normally structured either as a stock bonus plan or as a combination of stock bonus plan and money purchase pension plan.6 Unlike other qualified retirement plans, ESOPs must invest primarily (meaning at least 50 percent of plan assets) in employer securities.

A *leveraged ESOP* may borrow funds from a bank, the employer, or other qualified lender with which to buy stock from existing stockholders or the corporation. The employer-corporation then makes tax-deductible contributions to the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), and these contributions can be used by the ESOP to pay principal and interest on the loan. Annual tax-deductible contributions up to 25 percent of covered employee compensation can be made to repay loan principal, and unlimited contributions can be made to pay interest. In effect, the loan used by a leveraged ESOP to buy employer securities is financed with tax-deductible employer contributions.

<sup>6</sup>These kinds of qualified retirement plans are described more fully in Chapter 14.

In addition, there is a special nonrecognition provision applying to sales of qualified securities to ESOPs.7 This provision permits a seller of closely held qualified securities8 that have been held by the seller for at least three years prior to the sale to an ESOP to elect not to recognize any capital gain from the sale of such securities if, within a specified period (beginning three months before the sale and ending 12 months after such sale), the seller acquires an equivalent amount of qualified replacement property. In general, *qualified replacement property* means any equity or debt security of a domestic operating corporation. There can also be a partial nonrecognition of gain. The income tax basis of the seller in the replacement securities is the same as his or her basis in the securities sold to the ESOP. To qualify for this nonrecognition of capital gain, the ESOP must own at least 30 percent of the total value or number of shares of employer securities outstanding after the sale.

#### **CASE EXAMPLE**

We can illustrate this approach by referring back to the case of Heather Rosen. If Heather's corporation, New Computer, establishes a leveraged ESOP, she could sell 30 percent or more of her stock to the ESOP. Heather would not recognize any capital gain on the sale. She would invest the sale proceeds in marketable stocks or bonds of domestic operating companies (replacement securities), which could provide marketability and diversification for her portfolio. Furthermore, she would not necessarily have to sell all of her corporation stock (or even a controlling interest in it). The ESOP only needs to own 30 percent of the corporation's stock after the sale. However, there are restrictions on the ESOP's ability to dispose of the qualified securities for three years after the sale and on allocations of qualified securities by the ESOP to the selling shareholder or to a more than 25 percent shareholder who may be a participating employee in the ESOP.

**Rollover of Gain from Qualified Small Business Stock** In addition to the exclusion of one-half of the gain provision noted earlier, there is a nonrecognition of gain provision9 under which gain realized from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock held for more than six months by a taxpayer is not recognized (i.e., is rolled over) to the extent that the

<sup>7</sup>The provision is Section 1042 of the IRC.

<sup>8</sup> In general, qualified securities are employer securities that are issued by a domestic corporation that has no stock outstanding that is readily tradable on an established securities market and meets certain other conditions (i.e., is a closely held corporation).

<sup>9</sup>This is Section 1045 of the IRC.

taxpayer uses the proceeds of the sale to purchase other qualified small business stock within 60 days of the sale. The basis of the former stock is carried over to the new stock. This essentially allows any stockholder of a qualified small business (other than a C corporation as a stockholder) to sell one small business and buy another business tax deferred.

## **Selling Strategies**

Assume that the owner of appreciated property decides to sell or exchange the property in a taxable transaction. A sale might be desired because the owner wants cash now for reinvestment or other needs. The owner may want to have control over how the sale proceeds are reinvested. Also, there may not be any acceptable exclusion or deferral strategies available to the owner. Furthermore, if the owner expects the whole market to fall (e.g., a bear market), a sale, rather than deferral, may be the preferred course. Finally, if an investor already has sizeable capital losses in a year or carried forward from prior years, these would be available to offset some or all of any capital gains from a taxable sale.

**Favorable Capital Gains Tax Rates** The tax rates applying to net capital gains are now significantly lower than the rates applying to ordinary income. The deferral strategies described earlier almost always involve requirements, limitations, or costs that are not present in outright sales. Therefore, the lower capital gains rates become, the more tempted taxpayers may be to sell their appreciated assets and pay the capital gains tax.

**Installment Sales** Any capital gain on installment sales is realized and recognized as payments are made. The part of each installment that is capital gain is determined by multiplying the payment by a gross profit percentage, which is the gross profit on the sale divided by the contract price. Also, installment sales have interest on the unpaid balance. The part of each installment that constitutes interest is taxable as ordinary income to the seller.

However, there may be reasons not to structure sales as installment sales. First, the seller may want the sales price in cash now. There also may be other tax factors to consider, such as existing capital losses, suspended passive activity losses, and depreciation recapture. In addition, in an installment sale, the seller takes an installment note from the buyer for future payments. Thus, the security (credit risk) of future payments could be a factor.

Finally, not all sales are eligible for installment treatment. For example, marketable stocks or securities are not eligible.

**Other Sales for Periodic Payments** Aside from straight installment sales, as just described, there are other sales where the purchase price is paid over time. An example would be self-canceling installment notes (SCINs). These arrangements are made within the family and normally are undertaken for estate planning reasons.

## **A Combination of Approaches**

Of course, investors do not have to follow just one of these strategies. They often mix them. They might, for example, sell some of their appreciated stock and reinvest the proceeds, use some to make charitable donations, give some away within their family, and keep the rest. Furthermore, if they happen to have acquired the stock at different times with different tax bases, they can sell the stock with the highest bases and give away to charity or keep the stock with the lowest bases.
