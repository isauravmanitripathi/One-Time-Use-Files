  <p block-type="Text">
   The widespread practice of quoting option prices in terms of their Black–Scholes implied volatilities (IVs) in no way implies that market participants believe underlying returns to be lognormal. On the contrary, the variation of IVs across option strike and term to maturity, which is widely referred to as the
   <i>
    volatility surface
   </i>
   , can be substantial. In this article, we highlight some empirical observations that are most relevant for the construction and validation of realistic models of the volatility surface for equity indices.

    The Shape of the Volatility Surface
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Ever since the 1987 stock market crash, volatility surfaces for global indices have been characterized by the
   <i>
    volatility skew
   </i>
   : For a given expiration date, IVs increase as strike price decreases for strikes below the current stock price (spot) or current forward price. This tendency can be seen clearly in the S&amp;P500 volatility surface shown in Figure 1. For short-dated expirations, the cross section of IVs as a function of strike is roughly V-shaped, but has a rounded vertex and is slightly tilted. Generally, this V-shape softens and becomes flatter for longer dated expirations, but the vertex itself may rise or fall depending on whether the term structure (TS) of (ATM) At-themoney volatility is upward or downward sloping.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Conventional explanations for the volatility skew include the following:

     <i>
      The leverage effect

    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">

     <i>
      The risk of default

     : There is a nonzero probability for the price of a stock to collapse if the issuer defaults.

    <li block-type="ListItem">
     <i>

     </i>
     : Investors are net long of stock and so tend to be net buyers of downside puts and sellers of upside calls.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The volatility skew probably reflects all of these factors.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Conventional stochastic volatility (SV) models imply a relationship between the assumed dynamics of the instantaneous volatility and the volatility skew (see Chapter 8 of [8]). Empirically, volatility is well known to be roughly lognormally distributed [1, 4] and in this case, the derivative of IV with respect to log-strike in an SV model is approximately independent of volatility [8]. This motivates a simple measure of skew: For a given term to expiration, the "95–105" skew is simply the difference between the IVs at strikes of 95% and 105% of the forward price. Figure 2 shows the historical variation of this measure as a function of term to expiration as calculated from end-of-day SPX volatility surfaces generated from listed options prices between January 2, 2001 to February 6, 2009. To fairly compare across different dates and over all volatility levels, all volatilities for a given date are scaled uniformly to ensure that the one-year at-the-money-forward (ATMF) volatility equals its historical median value over this period (18.80%). The skews for all listed expirations are binned by their term to expiration; the median value for each five-day bin is plotted along with fits to both 1

   and the best-fitting power-law dependence on
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The important conclusion to draw here is that the TS of skew is approximately consistent with square-root (or at least power-law) decay. Moreover, this rough relationship continues to hold for longer expirations that are typically traded (OTC) Over-thecounter.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Significantly, this empirically observed TS of the volatility skew is inconsistent with the 1
   <i>
    /T
   </i>
   dependence for longer expirations typical of popular one-factor SV models (see Chapter 7 of [8] for example): Jumps affect only short-term volatility skews, so adding jumps does not resolve this disagreement between theory and observation. Introducing more volatility factors with different timescales [3] does help but does not entirely eliminate the problem. Market models of IV (
   <i>

   </i>
   <b>
    Implied Volatility: Market Models
   </b>
   ) obviously fit the TS of skew by construction, but such models are, in general, time inhomogeneous and, in any case, have not so far proven to be tractable. In summary, fitting the TS of skew remains an important and elusive benchmark by which to gauge models of the volatility surface.

    Volatility Surface Dynamics
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Volatility surfaces cannot have arbitrary shape; they are constrained by no-arbitrage conditions (such as the convexity of price with respect to strike). In practice, these restrictions are not onerous and generally are met provided there are no large gradients anywhere on the surface. This observation, together with the fact that index options in most markets trade actively over a wide range of strikes and expiration dates, might lead one to expect the dynamics of the volatility surface to be quite complicated. On the contrary, several principal component analysis (PCA) studies have found that an overwhelming fraction of the total daily variation in volatility surfaces is explained by just a few factors, typically three.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Table 1 makes clear that a level mode, one where the entire volatility surface shifts upward or downward in tandem, accounts for the vast majority of variation; this result holds across different markets, historical periods, sampling frequencies, and statistical methodologies. Although the details vary, generally this mode is not quite flat; short-term volatilities tend to move more than longer ones, as evidenced by the slightly upward tilt in Figure
   <math display="inline">
    3(a)
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In most of the studies, a TS mode is the next most important mode: Here, short-term volatilities move in the opposite direction from longer term ones, with little variation across strikes. In the Merrill Lynch data, which are sampled at 30, 91, 182, 273, 365, and 547 days to expiration, the pivot point is close to the
   <math display="inline">
    91\text{-day term}
   </math>
   (see Figure 3(b)). In all studies where TS is the second most important mode, the third mode is always a skew mode: one where strikes below the spot (or forward) move in the opposite direction

  <p block-type="Text">
   In the study by Cont and da Fonseca [5], a TS mode does not figure in the top three modes; instead a skew mode and another strike-related mode related to the curvature emerge as number two and three. This likely reflects the atypically low variation in TS over the historical sample period and is not due to any methodological differences with the other studies. As in the other studies, the patterns of variation were very similar across markets (S&amp;P500 and FTSE100).

    Changes in Spot and Volatility are Negatively Correlated

   Perhaps the sturdiest empirical observation of all is simply that changes in spot and changes in volatility (by pretty much any measure) are negatively and strongly correlated. From the results that we have surveyed here, this can be inferred from the high

    R^2

   obtained in the regressions of daily ATMF volatility changes shown in Table 1, as well as directly from the correlations between spot return and PCA modes shown in Table 2.

   <math display="inline">
    -0.92
   </math>
   for daily changes between September 15, 2008 and end December 31, 2008. On the other hand, the skew mode, which is essentially uncorrelated with spot return in the full historical period (see Table 1), did exhibit stronger correlation in this period
   <math display="inline">
    (-0.55)

   , while the TS mode did not. These observations underscore the robustness of the level-spot correlation as well as the timevarying nature of correlations between spot returns and the other modes of fluctuation of the volatility surface.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Other studies have also commented on the robustness of the spot-volatility correlation. For example, using a maximum-likelihood technique, Aït-Sahalia and Kimmel [1] carefully estimated the parameters of The Heston, CEV, and GARCH models from S&amp;P500 and VIX data between January 2, 1990 and September 30, 2003; the correlation between spot and volatility changes varied little between these models and various estimation techniques, and all estimates were around
   <math display="inline">
    -0.76
   </math>
   for the period studied.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   A related question that was studied by Bouchaud et al. [4] is whether spot changes drive realized
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   volatility changes or vice versa. By computing the correlations of leading and lagging returns and squared-returns, they find that for both stocks and stock indices, price changes lead to volatility changes. In particular, there is no volatility feedback effect, whereby changes in volatility affect future stock prices. Moreover, unlike the decay of the IV correlation function itself, which is power-law with an exponent of around
   <math display="inline">
    0.3
   </math>
   for SPX, the decay of the spot-volatility correlation function is exponential with a short half-life of a few days. Supposing the general level of IV (the variation of which accounts for most of the variation of the volatility surface) to be highly correlated with realized volatility, these results also apply to the dynamics of the IV surface. Under diffusion assumptions, the relationship between implied and realized volatility is even more direct: Instantaneous volatility is given by the IV of the ATM option with zero time to expiration.

A subsequent study [6] looked at S&amp;P500 monthly data between June 1998 and April 2002 (47 points) and found that for that period, the data were much more consistent with the sticky-delta rule than with the sticky-strike rule.
