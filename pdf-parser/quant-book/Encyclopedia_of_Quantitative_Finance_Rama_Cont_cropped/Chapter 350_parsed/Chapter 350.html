   Factor models of security returns decompose the random return on each of a cross section of assets into factor-related and asset-specific returns. Letting

    Approximate Factor Models
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Security market returns have strong comovements, but the assumption that returns obey a strict factor model is easily rejected. In practice, for any reasonable value of
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   , there will be at least some discernible positive correlations between the assetspecific returns of at least some assets. An approximate factor model (originally developed by Chamberlain and Rothschild [7]) weakens the strict factor model of exactly zero correlations between all asset-specific returns. Instead, it assumes that there is a large number,
   <math display="inline">
    n
   </math>
   , of assets and the proportion of the correlations that are nonnegligibly different from zero is close to zero. This condition is formalized as a bound on the eigenvalues of the asset-specific return covariance matrix:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \max \, eigval[cov(\varepsilon, \varepsilon')] &lt; c \tag{3}

  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   for some fixed
   <math display="inline">
    c &lt; \infty

   <i>
    diversifiable risk
   </i>
   in the sense that any well-spread portfolio
   <math display="inline">
    w
   </math>
   will have asset-specific variance near zero:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \lim_{n \to \infty} w' \operatorname{cov}(\varepsilon, \varepsilon') w = 0 \text{ for any } w

    \lim_{n \to \infty} w' w = 0 \tag{4}

  <p block-type="Text">
   Note that an approximate factor model uses a "large

    Statistical Factor Models
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Financial researchers differentiate between characteristic-based, macroeconomic, and statistical factor models [2]). In a characteristic-based model, the
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   factor betas of asset are tied to observable characteristics of the securities, such as company size or the book-to-price ratio, or the industry categories to which each security belongs. In macroeconomic factor models, the factors are linked to the innovations in observable economic time series such as inflation and unemployment. In a statistical factor model, neither factors nor betas are tied to any external data sources and the model is identified from the covariances of asset returns alone.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Recall the convenient rotation
   <math display="inline">
    E[ff'] = I

   <math display="block">

   Assuming that the cross section of return is multivariate normal and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) through time, the sample covariance matrix
   <math display="inline">
    \widehat{cov}(r, r')
   </math>
   has a Wishart distribution. Imposing the strict factor model assumption
   <math display="inline">
    (6)
   </math>
   on the true covariance matrix, it is possible to estimate the set of parameters
   <math display="inline">
    B, D
   </math>
   by maximum likelihood. This maximum likelihood problem requires high-dimensional nonlinear maximization: there are
   <math display="inline">
    nK + n
   </math>
   parameters to estimate in
   <math display="inline">
    B, D
   </math>
   . There is also an inequality constraint on the maximization problem: the diagonal elements of
   <math display="inline">
    D
   </math>
   must be nonnegative, since they represent variances. The solution to the maximum likelihood problem yields estimates of
   <math display="inline">
    B

   <math display="inline">

   <i>
    factor scores

  <h3>
   <b>
    Asymptotic Principal Components
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The maximum likelihood method of factor model estimation relies on a strict factor model assumption and a time-series sample which is large relative to the number of assets in the cross section. Standard principal components require the even stronger condition of a scalar factor model. Neither method is well suited for asset returns where the cross section tends to be very large. Connor and Korajczyk [11] develop an alternative method called asymptotic principal components, building on the approximate factor model theory of Chamberlain and Rothschild [7]. Connor and Korajczyk analyze the eigenvector decomposition of the
   <math display="inline">
    T \times T
   </math>
   cross product matrix of returns rather than that of the
   <math display="inline">
    n \times n
   </math>
   covariance matrix of returns. They show that given a large cross section, the first
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   eigenvectors of this cross-product matrix provide consistent estimates of the
   <math display="inline">
    k \times T
   </math>
   matrix of factor returns. Stock and Watson [31] extend the theory to allow both large time series and large crosssectional samples, time-varying factor betas, and provide a quasi-maximum likelihood interpretation of the technique. Bai [3] analyzes the large-sample distributions of the factor returns and factor beta matrix estimates in a generalized version of this approach.

    Macroeconomic Factor Models
   </b>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The rotational indeterminacy in statistical factor models makes these unsuitable for the application of factor models to many research problems. Statistical factor models do not allow the analyst to assign meaningful labels to the factors and betas; one can identify the
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   pervasive risks in the cross section of returns, but not what these risks represent in terms of economic and financial theory.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   One approach to making the factor decomposition more interpretable is to rotate the statistical factors so that the rotated factors are maximally correlated with prespecified macroeconomic factors. If

   As long as  has rank
   <i>
    k

   <i>
    ft
   </i>
   , is the span of the original statistical factors,
   <i>
    ft
   </i>
   . However, the rotated factors can now be interpreted as the return factors that are correlated with the specified macroeconomic series. With this rotation the new factors are no longer orthogonal, in general. This approach is described in [12].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Alternatively, one can work with the prespecified macroeconomic series directly. Chan
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [8] and Chen
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [9] develop a macroeconomic factor model in which the factor innovations
   <i>
    f
   </i>
   are observed directly (using innovations in economic time series) and the factor betas are estimated via time-series regression of each asset's return on the time series of factors. They begin with the standard description of the current price of each asset,
   <i>
    pit,
   </i>
   as the present discounted value of its expected cash flows:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    p_{it} = \sum_{s=1}^{\infty} \frac{E[c_{it}]}{(1+\rho_{st})^s}

   <i>
    t

   They propose inflation-, interest-rate-, and business-cyclerelated variates to capture these common factors. Shanken and Weinstein [29] find that empirically the model lacks robustness in that small changes in the included factors or the sample period have large effects on the estimates. Connor [10] argues that although macroeconomic factor models are theoretically attractive since they provide a deeper explanation for return comovement than statistical factor models, their empirical fit is substantially weaker than statistical and characteristic-based models. Vassalou [33] argues, on the other hand, that the ability of the Fama–French model (see below) to explain the cross section of mean returns can be attributed to the fact that Fama–French factors provide good proxies for macroeconomic factors.

    Characteristic-based Factor Models
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A surprisingly powerful method for factor modeling of security returns is the characteristic-based factor model. Rosenberg [26] was the first to suggest that suitably scaled versions of standard accounting ratios (book-to-price ratio, market value of equity) could serve as factor betas. Using these predefined betas, he estimates the factor realizations
   <i>
    ft
   </i>
   by cross-sectional regression of time-
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   asset returns on the predefined matrix of betas.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In a series of very influential papers, Fama and French [16, 17, 18] propose a two-stage method for estimating characteristic-based factor models. In the first stage, they sort assets into fractile portfolios based on book-to-price and market value characteristics. They use the differences between returns on the top and bottom fractile portfolios as proxies for the factor returns. They also include a market factor proxied by the return on a capitalization-weighted market index. In the second stage, the factor betas of portfolios and/or assets are estimated by time-series regression of asset returns on the derived factors. Carhart [6] and Jegadeesh and Titman [22, 23] show that the addition of a momentum factor (proxied by high 12-month return minus low 12-month return) adds explanatory power to the Fama–French threefactor model, both in terms of explaining comovements and mean returns. Goyal and Santa-Clara [19] and Ang
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [1, 2] also find evidence for an ownvolatility-related factor, for explaining both return comovements and mean returns.

   <b>
    Industry–Country Components Models
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   One of the most empirically powerful factor decompositions for equity returns is an error-components model using industry affiliations. This involves setting the factor beta matrix equal to zero/one dummies, with row
   <i>
    i
   </i>
   containing a one in the
   <i>
    j
   </i>
   th column if and only if firm
   <i>
    i
   </i>
   belongs to industry
   <i>
    j
   </i>
   . This is the simplest type of characteristic-based factor model of equity returns.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The first statistical factor is dominant in equity returns, accounting for 80–90% of the explanatory power in a multifactor model. The standard specification of an error-components model does not isolate the "first" factor since its influence is spread across the factors. Heston and Rouwenhorst [20] describe an alternative specification in which this factor is
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   separated from the
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   industry factors. They add a constant to the model, so that the expanded set of factors
   <math display="inline">
    k + 1
   </math>
   is not directly identified (this lack of identification is sometimes called the dummy variable trap, referring to a model that includes a full set of zero-one dummies plus a constant). Heston and Rouwenhorst, impose an adding-up restriction on the estimated
   <math display="inline">
    k+1
   </math>
   factors; the set of industry factors must sum to zero. This adding-up restriction on the factors restores statistical identification to the model, requiring constrained least squared in place of standard least squares estimation. It also provides a useful interpretation of the estimated factors: the factor associated with the constant term is the "marketwide" or "first" factor, and the factors associated with the industry dummies are the extra-market industry factors. This specification has been widely adopted in the literature.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Heston and Rouwenhorst's adding-up condition is particularly useful in a multicountry context. It allows one to include an overlapping set of country and industry dummies without encountering the problem of the dummy variable trap. Including a constant, an international industry-country factor model must impose adding-up conditions both on the estimated industry factors and on the estimated country factors. This type of country-industry specification is useful, for example, in measuring the relative contribution of cross-border and national influences to return comovements; see, for example, [21].

    Determining the Number of Factors
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   In the case of maximum likelihood estimation of a strict factor model, it is possible to test for the correct number of factors by comparing the likelihood of the model with k factors to that of a
   <math display="inline">
    k + 1
   </math>
   factor model. Under the standard assumptions, for large timeseries samples, the ratio of the log likelihoods has an approximate chi-squared distribution. There are drawbacks to this test in the context of asset returns data and its performance has been problematic; see, for example, [14, 15], and [28], in which the test is found to be unreliable. The test may rely too strongly on the assumption of a strict factor model (an exactly diagonal covariance matrix of asset-specific returns), which is at best a convenient fiction in the case of asset returns. Also, it tests the hypothesis that the correct number of factors has been prespecified,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   rather than optimally determining the best number of factors to use.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Connor and Korajczyk [13] derive a test for the number of factors, which is robust to having an approximate, rather than strict factor model. It is based on the decline in average idiosyncratic variance as additional factors are added.

   Bai and Ng [4] take a different approach to the factor-number decision. They view the choice of the number of factors as a model selection problem. and build on the Akaike and Bayesian information criterea (BIC) information criteria-based tests for model selection. Bai and Ng compute the average asset-specific variance (both across time and across securities) in a model with

  <p block-type="Text">

   A central concern in asset pricing theory is the determination of asset risk premia and their connection to sources of pervasive risk. Factor models have been central to this research area. In a factor beta pricing model, the expected return of each asset equals the risk-free return plus a linear combination of the factor betas of the assets, with the linear weights (factor risk premia) constant across securities:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">

Toward a Theory of Market Value of Risky Assets.(unpublished working paper).) [32], the arbitrage pricing theory [27], the Fama-French model [17, 18], and [24] intertemporal capital asset pricing model.
