    Glosten–Milgrom Models
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Glosten–Milgrom models analyze transaction prices arising from quotes of competing risk-neutral dealers making a market in a single security and facing both privately informed and uninformed traders. The dealers must quote bid and offer prices at which they are willing to, respectively, buy and sell. A trader arrives and decides to buy, sell, or leave. Upon seeing the outcome of the trader's decision, the dealers modify their quotes in preparation for the next arrival. Implementation of the model thus requires a specification of the arrival processes of informed and uninformed traders and the nature of public and private information. This specification, in turn, leads to the calculation of quotes and the time series of quotes and transaction prices.

    Mathematical Structure and Results

  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The discussion follows the analysis in [7], and proofs can be found there. The model is designed to describe trade over a relatively small interval of time in which there is private information about the future cash flows of the security, but this private information will depreciate, either through information revealed in trade or
   <i>
    via
   </i>
   public announcements of the information. By the time all asymmetric information has been resolved, at
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   , the value of a share of the security will be
   <i>
    V
   </i>
   . Prior to
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   , this value is not known, but at time
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   , there has been a history of trade and public announcements. This information is summarized by the filtration
   <i>
    Ht
   </i>
   . Justified by the fact that a relatively short period of time is being analyzed, the time value of money and risk aversion can be reasonably ignored, and the value of a share of stock at time
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   is just its expected value conditional on time

   During the trading period, potential traders arrive at the market one by one. An arriving trader at time

   observes the bid and ask quotes

   Consider the quoting problem of a market maker at time
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   facing a possible arrival. Should the arrival buy, the market maker will receive the ask price and give up a share of stock ultimately worth
   <i>
    V
   </i>
   . This will happen if
   <i>
    Zt
   </i>
   exceeds the ask price. Similarly, if the arrival sells at the bid, the market maker will receive a share ultimately worth
   <i>
    V
   </i>
   and pay the bid price. Otherwise, there will be no transaction and no profit. Thus, the expected profit to a market maker quoting bid
   <i>
    B
   </i>
   and ask
   <i>
    A
   </i>
   , is
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">

   (1)
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Assuming that dealer competition drives the expected profit for both a buy and a sell to zero, the ask and bid quotes are the solutions, if they exist, to the two fixed-point problems:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    A_t = E[V|H_t, Z_t &gt; A_t] \quad \text{and}

    B_t = E[V|H_t, Z_t &lt; B_t] \tag{2}

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   If solutions do not exist, the market is said to close down.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The zero-profit bid and ask prices are "no regret" prices in the sense that the market maker, after having sold to an order at the ask price will revise expectations and the revised expectation is precisely the ask price. That is, to quote the ask price the dealer must determine what the revised expectations will be in the event of a purchase.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The first result is immediate and intuitive: the ask price exceeds the expectation at the time of the quote that exceeds the bid. If a buy occurs, one possibility is that the arriving trader is informed and has a valuation higher than the ask price. It could never be the case that the arriving trader is informed and has a valuation less than the ask price and buys. This alone requires that the market increase the conditional expected value in response to a buy. This argument justifies
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   the term
   <i>
    adverse selection spread
   </i>
   as a description of the difference between the ask price and bid in the model (

    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Adverse Selection
   </b>
   ).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The second observation follows from the fact that transaction prices occur at the "no regret" quotes. The transaction price is a conditional expectation of the terminal value,
   <i>
    V
   </i>
   . A transaction at time
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   can be written, where

   indicates the information available following a transaction at time

  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    P_{t} = A_{t} \mathbf{1}_{\{Z_{t} &gt; A_{t}\}} + B_{t} \mathbf{1}_{\{Z_{t} &lt; B_{t}\}}

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Thus, transaction prices form a martingale. From this observation, flow a number of immediate conclusions. Since reasonably behaved martingales such as this one converge, the absolute differences between transaction prices must get small. As long as trade continues, it must be the case that the spread gets small and that the informational difference between the informed traders and the market gets small.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A number of comparative statics results are readily obtained. At a point in time, an increase in the probability of informed arrival or an increase in the precision of private information increases the spread. As the elasticity of uninformed demand and supply increases, the spread increases as well. It is important to note, however, that these results hold only at a point in time—when the probability of informed trade increases, the rate at which trade reveals private information increases reducing spreads in the future.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The uninformed valuation plays a crucial role in the model. If the uninformed valuation varies little from the mean, then it is quite possible that the only bid and ask prices satisfying the condition are, respectively, the lowest and highest possible realizations of
   <i>
    V
   </i>
   . In this case, there is no trade and the market shuts down. On the other hand, if there is significant variation, so that the uninformed demand and supply are inelastic, then interior solutions for the quotes are guaranteed.

   1 is 0.004. Thus, a stock with even moderate trading will reveal private information relatively rapidly, and the spread will decline quickly.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Relating the expected first passage time and the spread at the first passage time indicates an interesting trade-off. As the percentage of informed trading goes up, the initial spread increases, yet the speed with which the spread declines goes up as well. For

  <p block-type="Text">
   This raises intriguing questions about the welfare effects of informed trading; but these are not issues that this example of a Glosten–Milgrom model can handle. Since the uninformed trade, no matter what the spread, informed profit is merely uninformed loss and the total welfare is unaffected by how much informed trade there is. The spread is often related to a welfare measure, but this requires a questionable value judgment—informed are not entitled to their profits. To measure the welfare loss associated with informed trade, a model must incorporate elastic trade on the part of the uninformed.

    Assumptions and Extensions
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   One feature of the model leads to its immediate refutation—trades are for a single quantity. Several papers have extended the basic analysis to multiple trade sizes. Two possible trade sizes is considered by Easley and O'Hara [3], while Glosten [5] considers a continuum of trade sizes. Glosten [6] analyzes
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   continuous trade sizes in an electronic limit order book (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>

   ). Interestingly, there is evidence in [8] that the number of trades, as opposed to quantity is what contributes to volatility. Furthermore, [1] shows that a Kyle model ([9]; also
   <i>
    see
   </i>

   ) with a continuum of allowable trades can, under some conditions, be thought of as a temporal aggregation of a dynamic Glosten–Milgrom model with a strategic informed trader.

   One unreasonable assumption of the model is that the bid and offer are determined by a zero-profit assumption. The assumption implies that there is no compensation for the time and effort market making requires. The reason for the assumption is that the analysis can then focus on only the informational source of the spread. It is easy to extend the model to include compensation for market-maker opportunity (and other) cost by specifying that the bid, for example, satisfy

   is the economic cost that needs to be covered. With this more realistic specification, it is now apparent that the spread consists of two components—the cost component and the adverse selection component.

   When there is no cost component, the martingale property of transaction prices implies that there will be no serial correlation in price changes. When there is only a cost component, however, it is easy to see that transaction prices will bounce back and forth between bid and ask, inducing negative serial correlation in price changes. That the different spread components lead to different transaction price dynamics informs empirical investigations of the spread (

   A strong assumption of the model is that the existence of informed traders is common knowledge. This is relaxed, first in [4] and then in a series of papers by Easley, O'Hara, and coauthors, in which the

   (PIN) is theoretically derived and empirically investigated (

   While the model is described in terms of competing market makers, it is somewhat more general than that. In particular, the model is not necessarily inconsistent with modeling trade on the New York Stock Exchange, or even an electronic limit order book. In the first case, the competing providers of liquidity are the specialist, floor brokers, and limit order submitters. In the second, limit order submitters com-

   Two survey papers on market microstructure, [10] and [2], are recommended. The first is stronger on a survey of empirical analyses, while the second is stronger on modeling issues.
