DPCs intermediate swaps between the sponsor and third parties under the approved International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. Enhanced subsidiaries differ from other derivativeproduct subsidiaries, as their credit ratings do not depend on their parent's guarantee. A DPC may engage in over-the-counter interest rate, currency, and equity swaps and options as well as certain exchangetraded futures and options depending on its individual structure. A DPC is capitalized at a level appropriate for the scope of its business activities and desired rating. In most cases, DPCs have been set up to overcome credit sensitivity in the derivative-product markets. There are two types of DPCs: continuation and termination structures. The continuation structures are designed to honor their contracts to full maturity even when a wind-down event occurs, while termination structures are designed to honor their contracts to full maturity, or should certain events occur, to terminate and cash settle all their contracts prior to their final maturity. DPCs are typically AAA rated and are often referred to be the <i>AAA face of</i> <i>the sponsor</i>. They are market risk neutral by mirroring their trades with the third parties with the parent</p>",

The main risk factors of the asset portfolio, which include credit migration and market risk, are captured and projected by Monte Carlo simulation. Credit migration measures the new credit profile of the portfolio. Defaults net of recovery result in loss in the portfolio. Upgrades and downgrades directly affect the credit profile and the market value of the portfolio. Asset spreads and asset market values are projected in the capital model as well as credit migration. Historical spread data are used to calibrate the asset spread model. Rating migration, default correlation, and recovery assumptions are based on historical default studies and applied to the capital model. Market risk involves interest rates and foreign exchange rates (if there exists foreign currency valuation) modeling. SIVs or SIV-Lites are designed to be market risk neutral. Additional interest rate and foreign exchange rate sensitivity tests are usually used to this end. These tests mainly measure the change in the net asset portfolio value caused by a sudden change in the interest rates or foreign exchange rates. Liquidation risk is the most complicated risk factor to be modeled. Liquidation assumptions on the assets are required</p>",

Credit risk is the primary concern for a CDPC. If the reference entity on which a CDPC sells protection defaults, the CDPC will suffer a loss. Historical default studies and rating analysis are applied to simulate the time to default of the reference portfolio. Correlation and recovery assumptions are used to size the loss. Single-period time-to-default models are efficient tools to model credit risk. However, multiperiod rating transition models become necessary when the credit qualities of the underlying assets are required to be featured in the capital model. When modeling the credit risk of CDO tranches, drilling down to the underlying obligors is more effective to model the correlation risk.</p>",
