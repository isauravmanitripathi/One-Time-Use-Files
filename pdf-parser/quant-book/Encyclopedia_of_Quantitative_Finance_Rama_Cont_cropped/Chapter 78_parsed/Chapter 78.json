In general finite-horizon, discrete-time markets, it was shown ine [1] that the plain NA condition is equivalent to NFL. This seemed to suggest the possibility of a nice counterpart of the NFL condition for more complicated models. Delbaen [2] treated the case of continuous time, bounded, and continuous asset prices and used a neat condition, equivalent to NFL, called&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt; no free lunch with bounded risk (NFLBR) that can be stated in terms of sequence convergence. Essentially, the NFLBR condition precludes asymptotic arbitrage at some fixed point in time, when the overall downside risk of all the wealth processes involved is bounded. Later, [8] treated the case of infinite-horizon discrete-time models, where the NFLBR condition was once again used. At this point, with the continuous-path and infinitehorizon discrete-time cases resolved, there seemed to be one more \"gluing\" step to reach a general version of the FTAP for semimartingale models. Not only did Delbaen and Schachemayer make this step for semimartingale models, they actually further weakened the NFLBR condition to the no free lunch with vanishing risk (NFLVR) condition, where the previous asymptotic arbitrage at some fixed point in time is precluded and the overall downside risk of all the wealth processes <i>tends to zero</i> in the limit. In more precise mathematical terms, the NLFVR condition can be stated as <math display=\"inline\">\\overline{C} \\cap \\mathbf{L}_{\\perp}^{0} = \\{0\\}</math>, where <math display=\"inline\">\\overline{C}</math> is the closure in the very strong <math display=\"inline\">\\mathbf{L}^{\\infty}</math>-topology of (almost sure) uniform convergence.</p>",
