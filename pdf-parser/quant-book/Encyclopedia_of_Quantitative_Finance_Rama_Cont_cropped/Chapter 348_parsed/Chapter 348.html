  <p block-type="Text">
   In 1997, Robert Merton and Myron Scholes were awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics "for a new method to determine the value of derivatives". Of course, Fisher Black, who died two years earlier, had been associated with this huge contribution to financial engineering, now known as the Black-Scholes (BS) model. The purpose of econometrics of option pricing, as sketched later, is not really to check the empirical validity of this model. It has been widely documented that, by contrast with maintained assumptions of Black and Scholes geometric Brownian motion model, stock returns exhibit both stochastic volatility and jumps. Thus, the interesting issue is not the validity of the model itself. In this article, we focus on the assessment of the possible errors of the BS option pricing formula and on empirically successful strategies to alleviate them. We can get the right pricing and hedging formula with a wrong model. The widespread acceptance of the BS option pricing formula as a benchmark, among academics and investment professionals, is undoubtedly due to its usefulness for pricing and hedging options, irrespective of the unrealistic assumptions of the initial model. This is the reason the largest part of this article is focused on econometric modeling and inference about empirically valid extensions of the BS option pricing formula.

   However, it is worth stressing the general econometric content of arbitrage pricing. As first emphasized by Cox et al. [20], the message of the BS approach goes beyond any particular specification of the underlying stochastic processes. Arbitrage-free pricing models generally allow to interpret derivative prices as expectations of discounted payoffs, when expectations are computed with respect to an equivalent martingale measure. In this respect, a nice correspondence between the theory of arbitrage pricing and econometrics is worth noting. While option contracts are useful to complete the markets and so to get a unique equivalent martingale measure. While only the historical probability distribution can be estimated from return data on the underlying asset, option prices data allow the econometrician to perform some statistical inference about the relevant martingale measure. Econometric approaches based

  <p block-type="Text">
   on implied volatility and also those used for option pricing that are unrelated to the lognormal benchmark of Black and Scholes, either because they are based on unrelated parametric models or because they introduce some nonparametric components, are discussed.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   For sake of brevity, in this article, the only option contracts considered are European calls written on stocks. In the same manner, BS option pricing methodology has since been generalized to price many other derivative securities, and the econometric approaches sketched later can be extended accordingly.

   For the purpose of easy assessment of suitably normalized orders of magnitude, practitioners often prefer to plot the BS-implied volatility
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_{t}^{\text{imp}}(x_t)
   </math>
   rather than the option price
   <math display="inline">
    C_t(x_t)
   </math>
   itself, as a function of moneyness
   <math display="inline">
    x_t
   </math>
   . The key reason that makes this sensible is that, in the BS model, the pricing distribution is indexed by a single volatility parameter
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma
   </math>
   . Under BS' assumptions, the probability distribution of the net return
   <math display="inline">
    r_S(t, T)
   </math>
   under
   <math display="inline">
    Q_{t,T}

   and variance
   <math display="inline">
    (T-t)\sigma^2

   <math display="inline">
    \aleph_{t,T}(\sigma)

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Then, the BS-implied volatility
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_{T-t}^{\text{imp}}(x_t)

   is defined as the value of the volatility parameter
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma^2

   that would generate the observed option price
   <math display="inline">

   was the normal

   . In other words,
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_{T-t}^{\text{imp}}(x_t)
   </math>
   is characterized as the solution of the following equation:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">

  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   It is worth recalling that the common use of the BS-implied volatility
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_h^{\text{imp}}(x_t)
   </math>
   by no means implies that the BS model is thought as a well-specified one. By equation (10),
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_h^{\text{imp}}(x_t)
   </math>
   is nothing but a known strictly increasing function of the observed option price
   <math display="inline">
    C_t(x_t)
   </math>
   . When plotting the volatility smile as a function
   <math display="inline">
    x_t \longrightarrow \sigma_h^{\text{imp}}(x_t)
   </math>
   rather than
   <math display="inline">
    x_t \longrightarrow
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    C_t(x_t)
   </math>
   , a convenient rescaling of the characterization (8) of the pricing distribution is simply considered. However, this rescaling depends on
   <math display="inline">
    x_t
   </math>
   and, by definition, produces a flat volatility smile whenever the BS pricing formula is valid in the cross section (for all moneyness levels at a given maturity) for some specific value of the volatility parameter. Note that for this the validity of the BS model itself is only a sufficient but not a necessary condition.
  </p>
  <h4>
   How to Graph the Smile
  </h4>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath" class="has-continuation">
   When the volatility smile is not flat, its pattern obviously depends on whether implied volatility
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_h^{\text{imp}}(x_t)
   </math>
   is plotted against strike K, moneyness
   <math display="inline">
    (K/S_t)
   </math>
   , forward moneyness
   <math display="inline">
    (KB(t, T)/S_t) = \exp(x_t)
   </math>
   , logforward moneyness
   <math display="inline">
    x_t
   </math>
   , and so on. The optimal choice of variable depends on what kind of information is expected to be revealed immediately on plotting implied volatilities. The common terminology volatility smile suggests that initially it was thought of as a kind of U-shaped pattern, whereas more recent words such as
   <i>
    smirk
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    frown
   </i>
   suggest that the focus is set on frequently observed asymmetries with respect to
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   a symmetric benchmark. Even more explicitly, since the volatility smile is supposed to reveal the underlying pricing probability measure
   <math display="inline">
    Q_{t,T}
   </math>
   , a common belief is that asymmetries observed in the volatility smile reveal a corresponding skewness in the distribution of (log) return under
   <math display="inline">
    Q_{t,T}
   </math>
   . Note, in particular, that, as mentioned above, a flat volatility smile at level
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma
   </math>
   characterizes a normal distribution with mean
   <math display="inline">
    (-\sigma^2/2)
   </math>
   and variance
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma^2
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Beyond the flat case, the common belief of a close connection between smile asymmetries and risk-neutral skewness requires further qualification. First, the choice of variable must of course matter for discussion of smile asymmetries. We argue later that log-forward moneyness
   <math display="inline">
    x_t
   </math>
   is the right choice, that is, the fact that the smile asymmetry issue must be understood as a violation of the identity:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \sigma_h^{\text{imp}}(x_t) = \sigma_h^{\text{imp}}(-x_t) \tag{14}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   This identity is actually necessary and sufficient to deduce from equation
   <math display="inline">
    (10)
   </math>
   that the general option pricing formula (9) fulfills the same kind of symmetry property as the BS one:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    C_t(x) = 1 - \exp(x) + \exp(x)C_t(-x) \tag{15}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Although equation
   <math display="inline">
    (15)
   </math>
   is automatically satisfied when
   <math display="inline">
    C_t(x) = B S_h[x, \sigma]
   </math>
   (by the symmetry property of the normal distribution:
   <math display="inline">
    N(-d) = 1 - N(d)
   </math>
   , it characterizes the symmetry property of the forward measure that corresponds to volatility smile symmetry. It actually mimics the symmetry property of the normal distribution with mean
   <math display="inline">
    (-\sigma^2/2)
   </math>
   and variance
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma^2
   </math>
   , which would prevail in the case of validity of the BS model. By differentiation of equation (15) and comparison with equation
   <math display="inline">
    (8)
   </math>
   , the following can be easily checked:
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The volatility smile is symmetric in the sense of equation (14) if and only if, when
   <math display="inline">
    f_{t,T}
   </math>
   stands for the probability density function of the log-return
   <math display="inline">
    r_S(t, T)
   </math>
   under the forward measure
   <math display="inline">
    Q_{t,T}
   </math>
   ,
   <math display="inline">
    \exp(x/2) f_{t,T}(x)
   </math>
   is an even function of
   <math display="inline">
    x
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In conclusion, the relevant concept of symmetry amounts to considering pairs of moneynesses that are symmetric to each other in the following sense:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    x_{1t} = \log\left[\frac{K_1B(t,T)}{S_t}\right] = -x_{2t} = \log\left[\frac{S_t}{K_2B(t,T)}\right]
   </math>
   (16)
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In other words, the geometric mean of the two strike prices coincides with the current stock price:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \sqrt{K_1 B(t,T)} \sqrt{K_2 B(t,T)} = S_t \tag{17}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   To conclude, it is worth noting that graphing the smile as a function of the log-moneyness
   <math display="inline">
    x_t
   </math>
   is even more relevant when one maintains the natural assumption that option prices are homogeneous functions of degree one with respect to the pair
   <math display="inline">
    (S_t, K)
   </math>
   . Merton [39] advocated this homogeneity property to preclude any "perverse local concavity" of the option price with respect to the stock price. It is obvious from equation
   <math display="inline">
    (9)
   </math>
   that a sufficient condition for homogeneity is that, as in the BS case, the pricing probability distribution
   <math display="inline">
    Q_{t,T}
   </math>
   does not depend on the level
   <math display="inline">
    S_t
   </math>
   of the stock price. This is the reason, as discussed by Garcia and Renault [30], homogeneity holds with standard stochastic volatility option pricing models and does not hold for GARCH option pricing.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   For our purpose, the big advantage of the homogeneity assumption is that it allows to compare volatility smiles (for a given time to maturity) at different dates since then the implied volatility
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_{h}^{\text{imp}}(x_t)
   </math>
   depends only on moneyness
   <math display="inline">
    x_t
   </math>
   and not directly on the level
   <math display="inline">
    S_t
   </math>
   of the underlying stock price. Moreover, from the Euler characterization of homogeneity,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    C_t = S_t \frac{\partial C_t}{\partial S_t} + K \frac{\partial C_t}{\partial K} \tag{18}

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   we deduce (by comparing equations 2 and 5) that
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \Delta_{1t} = \frac{\partial C_t}{\partial S_t} \tag{19}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   is the standard delta-hedging ratio. Note that a common practice is to compute a proxy of
   <math display="inline">
    \Delta_{1t}
   </math>
   by plugging
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_h^{\text{imp}}(x_t)
   </math>
   in the BS delta ratio. Unfortunately, according to some probability distribution of the volatility parameter, this approximation suffers from a convexity bias when the correct option price is a mixture of BS prices (see below). Renault [42] showed that the BS delta ratio (computed with
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_h^{\text{imp}}(x_t)
   </math>
   underestimates (respectively, overestimates) the correct ratio
   <math display="inline">
    \Delta_{1t}

   when the option is in the money (respectively, out of the money), that is, when

   These efforts to exploit prices of options to recover fundamental economic parameters have produced puzzling results. Aït-Sahalia and Lo [4] found that the nonparametrically implied function of relative risk aversion varies significantly across the range of S&amp;P 500 index values, from 1 to 60, and is U-shaped. Jackwerth [35] also found that the implied absolute risk-aversion function is U-shaped around the current forward price and also that it can become negative. Parametric empirical estimates of the coefficient of relative risk aversion also show considerable variation. Rosenberg and Engle [45] reported values ranging from

   to
   <math display="inline">

Garcia et al. [29] estimated a consumption-based asset pricing model with regimeswitching fundamentals and Epstein and Zin [23], the preferences.

   The general conclusion is that empirical riskneutral distributions that are computed without a precise account of the state variables that enter into the investors' information sets cannot provide valuable insights on intertemporal preferences. For example, Chabi-Yo et al. [17] showed that in an economy with regime changes either in fundamentals or in preferences, an application of the nonparametric methodology used by Jackwerth [35] to recover risk aversion will lead to similar negative estimates of the risk-aversion function in some states of wealth even though the risk-aversion functions are consistent with economic theory within each regime.

Revisiting a formula initially derived by Romano and Touzi [44], Willard [47] noted that the variance reduction technique, known as conditional Monte Carlo, can be applied even when the conditioning factor (the stochastic volatility process) is instantaneously correlated with the stock return as it is the case when leverage effect is present. He stressed that "by conditioning on the entire path of the noise element in the volatility (instead of just the average volatility), we can still write the option's price as an expectation over Black-Scholes prices by appropriately adjusting the arguments to the Black-Scholes formula". Willard's [47] "appropriate adjustment" of the stock price is actually akin to equation (33). Moreover, he does not explicitly adjust the interest rate according to equation (35) and works with a fixed risk-neutral distribution. More generally, the continuous-time dynamics of a pricing kernel
   <math display="inline">
    m_{t,T}
   </math>
   is considered, which is seen as the relative increment of a pricing kernel process

   The key idea of the mixture model is then to define a conditioning variable

   as approximatively an expected average volatility can be maintained by using risk-neutral expectations.

Beyond this risk premium effect, the leverage effect

    \xi_{t,T}

   will produce asymmetric volatility smirks. More precisely, Yoon [48] characterized the cumulative impact of the two effects of leverage and showed that they compensate each other almost exactly for at the money options.

    Data-driven Approaches
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In this section, we discuss methods that are, to various degrees, data-driven approaches, ranging from purely data-driven, sometimes called
   <i>
    nonparametric
   </i>
   approaches to semiparametric ones—where parametric and nonparametric estimators are combined. The estimation of option-implied densities can take various forms as there are many different ways to smooth a curve. Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression was used by Aït-Sahalia and Lo [3, 13, 14, 19], constrained splines by Bates [9], flexible parametric functional forms by Abadir and Rockinger [1], and neural networks by Aït-Sahalia and Duarte [2]; Bondarenko [11] and Garcia and Gençay [26], considered constrained least-square approaches. A more practitioneroriented approach was pioneered by Jackwerth and Rubinstein [36] and Rubinstein [46] who constructed implied trees from listed option prices.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   All these methods are data intensive and typically feature slow convergence rates. Only a few indices have enough liquid actively traded derivatives with a wide span of maturities and moneyness to warrant applications of these methods.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The extended method of moments (XMMs) estimator, introduced by Gagliardini
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [31], extends the standard GMM to accommodate a more general set of moment restrictions. The standard GMM is based on uniform conditional moment restrictions,
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   such as equation (20), which are valid for any value of the conditioning variables. The XMM can handle not only the uniform moment restrictions but also the local moment restrictions that are valid only for a given value of the conditioning variables. This leads to a new field of application to derivative pricing, as the XMM can be used for reconstructing the pricing operator on a given day, by using the information in a cross section of observed traded derivative prices and a time series of underlying asset returns. To illustrate the principle of XMM, the S&amp;P 500 index and its derivatives are considered. Suppose that an investor at date
   <math display="inline">
    t_0
   </math>
   is interested in estimating the price
   <math display="inline">
    c_{t_0}(h, k)
   </math>
   of a call option with time-to-maturity
   <math display="inline">
    h
   </math>
   and moneyness strike
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   that is currently not (actively) traded on the market. He/she has data on a time series of T daily returns of the S&amp;P 500 index, as well as on a small cross section of current option prices
   <math display="inline">
    c_{t_0}(h_i,k_i), i=1,\ldots,n
   </math>
   , of
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   highly traded derivatives. The XMM approach provides the estimated prices
   <math display="inline">
    \hat{c}_{t_0}(h,k)
   </math>
   for different values of moneyness strike
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   and time-to-maturity
   <math display="inline">
    h
   </math>
   , which interpolate the observed prices of highly traded derivatives and satisfy the hypothesis of the absence of arbitrage opportunities. These estimated prices are consistent for a large number of dates
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   , but with a fixed, even small, number of observed derivative prices
   <math display="inline">
    n
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A slightly less ambitious approach has been recently advocated by Erikkson et al. [24]. They suggest the use of the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) family (see Normal Inverse Gaussian Model) to approximate an unknown distribution risk-neutral density. The appeal of the NIG family of distributions is that they are characterized by the first four moments: mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. These are the moments we care about in many applications, including derivative pricing. The unknown density function is approximated by matching the cumulants. The latter are obtained from the cross section of option prices using methods proposed by Bakshi
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [5]. The strength of their approach is that they link the pricing of individual derivatives to the moments of the risk-neutral distribution, which has an intuitive appeal in terms of how volatility, skewness, and kurtosis of the riskneutral distribution can explain the behavior of the derivative prices. Erikkson et al. [24] showed that the approximation errors are minor when compared to several option pricing models that have known densities.

  <p block-type="Text">
   The affine jump-diffusion framework (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Affine Models
   </b>
   ) represents an important theoretical advance. Yet, it has been argued that it has its limitations, notably due to the exclusive use of compound Poisson processes to model jumps. These processes generate a finite number of jumps within a finite time interval and have accordingly been referred to as
   <i>
    finite activity jump processes
   </i>
   . The observation that asset prices actually display many small jumps on a fine timescale has led to the development of more general jump structures, which permit an infinite number of jumps to occur within any bounded time interval. Examples of infinite-activity jump models include the inverse Gaussian model of Barndorff-Nielsen [6, 7], the generalized hyperbolic class of Eberlein
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [22], the variance gamma (VG) model (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Variance-gamma Model
   </b>
   ) of Madan and Milne [38], the generalization of VG by Carr
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [15], and the finite moment log-stable model of Carr and Wu [16]. Empirical work by these authors is generally supportive of the use of infinite-activity processes as a way to model returns in a parsimonious way. The recognition that volatility is stochastic has led to further extensions of infinite-activity Levy models ( ´
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (BNS) Models
   </b>
   ;
   <b>
    Time-changed Levy Process ´
   </b>
   ) by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard [8] and Carr and Wu [16]. However, these models often assume that changes in volatility are independent of asset returns, and consider the leverage effect only under special cases. Carr and Wu [16] used time-changed Levy processes that general- ´ ize the affine Poisson jump diffusions by relaxing the affine structure and by allowing more general specifications of the jump structure. Since the pioneering work of Heston [32], the literature has used the characteristic function for deriving option prices. Accordingly, Carr and Wu focus on developing analytic expressions for the characteristic function of a time-changed Levy process ( ´
