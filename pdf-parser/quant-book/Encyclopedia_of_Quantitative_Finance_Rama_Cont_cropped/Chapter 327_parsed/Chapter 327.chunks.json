The impact of weather is also very predictable: the same causes will always lead to the same effects. Moreover, weather risk is often referred to as a <i>volumetric risk</i>, its potential impacts being mainly on the volume and not (at least directly) on the price. This explains why hedging of weather risk <i>via</i> the trading of commodities futures is difficult and imperfect. For example, oil futures price does not depend solely on demand (cold winter) and can be high even if the demand is low as in the case of a war, for instance. Volumetric risk is imprecisely compensated by the price variation in the futures position.</p>",

To deal with this risk, some financial contracts depending on weather conditions (temperature, rainfall, snowfall, etc.) were created and introduced on the financial market 10 years ago.

However, even if insurance companies were to write insurance policies against this risk, they would be typically too expensive for small farmers, and the compensation would take too long to be effective, partly because of the claim-checking procedure. The CRM has developed several projects throughout the globe in order to deal with agricultural risk transfer using weather derivatives. Among these projects, the pilot program conducted in India between 2003 and 2006 has been particularly successful. Microinsurance is a growing sector and more projects have been implemented across the globe to protect small- and medium-size farmers from weather risk. Some reinsurance companies have been particularly active in these programs by helping local institutions to implement the insurance schemes.</p>",

For this reason, the price obtained by utility maximization techniques is called indifference price (many references exist on this subiect. see, for example, [7] and Arbitrage Strategy).</p>",

It may be the difference between success and failure. More precisely, as previously mentioned, the high level of illiquidity, deriving partly from the fact that the underlying asset is not traded on financial markets, makes these new products difficult to evaluate and to use. The characterization of their price is very interesting as it questions the logic of these contracts itself. Moreover, the determination of the contract structure is a problem in itself: on one hand, the underlying market related to these risks is extremely illiquid, but, on the other hand, the logic of these products itself is closer to that of an insurance policy. Consequently, the question of the product design, which is unusual in finance, is raised.</p>",
