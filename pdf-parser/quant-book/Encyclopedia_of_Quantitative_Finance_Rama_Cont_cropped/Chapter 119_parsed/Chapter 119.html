   A variance swap is a volatility derivative that pays off on realized volatility of some underlying:

  <p block-type="Equation">

    Payoff = (\sigma_R^2 - K_{\text{var}}) \times N \tag{1}

    K
   </i>
   var is the fair value of the realized variance at inception, and
   <i>
    N

   is the notional amount, a leverage factor. The realized variance may be defined differently in different markets depending not only on the "default model" but also on specific contract specifications. One standard way for stocks [9] is to define realized variance as

  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \sigma_{\mathsf{R}}^{2} = \frac{252}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} u_{i}^{2}, \quad u_{i} = \ln \left( S_{i} \big/ S_{i-1} \right) \tag{2}

   This requires

   . The factor 252 is the approximate number of business days in a year, which gives an annualized variance. Also note that this formula assumes the mean of the returns to be zero. This means that it is distinct from the statistical variance of the returns. The mean of returns is typically small and setting it to zero makes returns on variance swaps additive over time. Using log returns to measure variance makes this formula compatible with the standard Black–Scholes option pricing formula.

   Uses of variance swaps include trading the level of volatility (variance swaps are a more pure way to do this compared to straddles), trading the realized/ implied vol spread, hedging of volatility exposures, or trading volatility on a forward basis via forward variance swaps. See [1] for more details about variance swaps, market practices, and their use in vol spread trading and correlation trading.

    Fair Value and Skew
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In [6], it is shown that a variance swap can be statically replicated with calls, puts, and a forward contract. The payoff for the variance swap then comes from delta hedging of this portfolio of options with the underlying. The fair value is determined by the cost of the replicating portfolio of options. The payoff in terms of realized volatility is achieved by delta hedging with the underlying. If the realized vol is exactly equal to the expected vol at inception, the hedging profits will be exactly equal to the cost of the option portfolio and the payout will be zero. As the portfolio of options (in theory) includes option of every strike, the fair value cost is affected significantly by the skew. The skew is defined to be the way the implied volatility changes as the strike changes, all else being equal.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The fair value can be derived using the volatility formula discussed in [4]. In this reference, the authors show the remarkable formula that the expected value of any smooth payoff function

   can be written in terms of stock and option prices.

   Market Risk
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In [5], the authors derive general results on market risk for variance swaps. Because variance is additive, a variance swap partway through its life is valued partly by realized vol (already observed) and partly by unrealized/implied vol, which is yet to be observed.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    V(t_0, T)(T - t_0) = \underbrace{V(t_0, t)}_{\text{Realized}} (t - t_0) + \underbrace{V(t, T)}_{\text{Unrealized}} (T - t) \quad (13)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   It follows from this that at time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   a variance swap with notional
   <math display="inline">
    N
   </math>
   has value
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    M(t) = N e^{-rT} [\lambda (V(t_0, t) - K_0)

   <br/>
   +
   <math>
    (1 - \lambda)(K_t - K_0)],

    \lambda = (t - t_0)/(T - t_0)

  <p block-type="Text">
   The first piece is just the time-weighted value of realized variance against the strike. The second piece is the time-weighted difference of fair value variance strikes. The same formula can be used to decompose the daily price change into three risk components: gamma, vega, and theta:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \Delta M(t) = M(t + \Delta t) - M(t)
   </math>
   <math display="block">
    = N \left( \underbrace{\frac{1}{\tau} V(t, t + \Delta t) \Delta t}_{\text{Gamma}} + \underbrace{(1 - \lambda_{t + \Delta t}) \cdot \Delta K}_{\text{Vega}} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{\tau} K_t \Delta t}_{\text{Theta}} \right) \qquad (15)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The biggest independent risk is in the fair value of the strike, which we have put in the vega component. This component also entails the skew risk.

   Although variance swaps can be statically replicated, volatility swaps (see Volatility Swaps) cannot. In [3], the authors show that there is an approximate dynamic replicating strategy for volatility
