    Securitization
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Securitization is the process by which tradable securities are created and introduced into capital markets. Such a process generally involves, typically, the isolation of a pool of assets and their repackaging into securities. Securitization enables the originator of such a transaction to manage and diversify its risk, to optimize the use of capital, while investors in these new securities are looking for diversification and higher return. Various types of risks have been securitized and different structures have been issued in the capital markets.
  </p>

    Asset-backed Securities
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The best-known example of securitization is certainly that of mortgages, with the first issue of mortgagebacked securities (MBS) taking place in 1970 in the United States. This transaction was the first of a very long series and the beginning of an extremely successful market. When the collateral of a securitization is made with more general assets than simple mortgages, the resulting securities are called
   <i>
    asset-backed securities
   </i>
   (
   <i>
    ABS
   </i>
   ). The collateral may be, for instance, credit card receivables or student loans.

   As of January 1, 2006 [1], the estimated outstanding in the United States is $8 trillion, which represents the largest segment of the American-fixed income market—31% of the total outstanding bond market (23% for the MBS and 8% for the ABS)—while the T-bond market only counts for 16%. The US market is the largest market in terms of securitization of mortgages in the world (80% of the total market). In Europe and Asia, the situation is slightly different since the legal framework for a securitization process to take place has been missing for a long time: new rules were adopted in the United Kingdom in 1987, in France in 1988,
   <i>
    ...
   </i>
   , and in Italy only in 1999. In Asia, the first Indian ABS took place in 1992 (the first MBS in 2000), the first MBS took place in 1998 in Japan (Japan is the largest Asian market), 2005 in China, and 2003 in Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Securitization of mortgages in the United States often require the participation of one of the three government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Mae), the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA or Ginnie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC or Freddie Mac). The securities backed by one of the GSEs are called
   <i>
    agency ABS
   </i>
   . Because of their government sponsorship (in particular that of the US Treasury), each of the GSEs could perfectly act as credit enhancer. Since most of the MBS are issued by these agencies, they implicitly have the full backing of the US treasury and therefore their credit risk is almost inexistent.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   There are also ABS issued without the sponsorship of one of the GSEs. They are called
   <i>
    nonagency ABS
   </i>
   . In this case, the collateral is not standard. It is typically made of jumbo loans (i.e., huge mortgages with a rather good credit quality), Alt-A loans (i.e., loans where a borrower could not provide complete documentation of his assets or income), subprime loans (i.e., loans to borrowers with heavy credit burden and poor credit quality), or commercial loans (i.e., loans on retail, office, or industrial properties). Until the recent crisis of 2007, the subprime market was the largest part of the nonagency ABS. Several factors can explain their importance; in particular, the growing number of homeowners with heavy debt burden, the aggressiveness of the marketing of subprime issuers, and the lending practices in this market. The characteristics of the ABS with this nonstandard collateral are very different and make them attractive to investors: not only do they offer a higher yield to compensate for the higher credit risk but also the prepayment risk is typically very limited. Therefore, they offer an alternative with a different risk profile.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   There are two main types of structures of ABS. The first type—
   <i>
    pass-through structures
   </i>
   —is the simplest. It corresponds to a securitization based directly on the collateral. The securities give a particular ownership right to the pool of
   <i>
    assets
   </i>
   . In this case, the cash flows of interest and principal received by the SPV are directly "passed through" to the investors. The investor receives a fraction of the payments on the pro rata of the number of shares he or she owns.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The second type—
   <i>
    pay-through structures
   </i>
   —is more complex. The securities, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), are not directly based on the assets ceded by the originator and the securitization process requires some structuring. The SPV buys the collateral from the originator and then issues a variety of instruments, which divide
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   the collateral cash flows into different classes or
   <i>
    tranches
   </i>
   . Such a structure enables to issue securities with different characteristics compared to the original assets; in particular, the structure and timing of payments, the associated risk can be different.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <i>
    Motivations
   </i>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Legal, regulatory, and accounting rules applicable to securitization transactions differ widely among countries and are subject to the ongoing modification and revision. It is necessary in structuring a securitization transaction to deal with legal, regulatory, and tax rules that may affect the sale and conveyance of the assets from the originator to the SPV. Another important issue relates to the legal framework governing the creation, maintenance, and operation of special purposes vehicles. Finally, depending on the originator's objectives, the balance sheet effects and accounting treatment and consequences of a particular securitization are essential and will frequently influence the ultimate structure of the transaction. In particular, the question of regulatory capital, or in other words, the amount of provisions to be put aside by financial institutions to be authorized by the regulators to have an activity, is essential and has a huge impact on the structure of transactions, as securitization can be used for capital relief to reduce regulatory capital allocations. In the case of insurance-linked securitization, things can be even more complex.

   <i>
    Advantages and Limitations
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Securitization offers several advantages to the originator. Among them, one can mention the transfer of risk, the reduction in the asset-liability mismatch and lower capital requirements by removing risk from the balance sheet (improvement of various financial ratios, more efficient use of capital, and compliance with capital standards). It is also a way to lock-in profits by cashing some money today and removing the uncertainty associated with the future cash flows. It can appear as a lower cost source of financing. Obviously, such a process is not for everyone since it is very costly: securitizations are expensive and take time. The more complicated and unusual the transaction is, the more expensive and time consuming it will be. There is also a critical mass to achieve. Only large originators or pools of originators can think of
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   securitization as a cost-effective way of transferring risks.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As far as investors are concerned, ABS offer an opportunity to invest in a specific pool of assets, with a high credit quality and a relatively large rate of return. This can enhance the diversification of their existing portfolios. There are, however, some risks associated with these financial products: liquidity risk, credit risk, event risk, and prepayment risk appear to be the main sources of uncertainties to which the investors are exposed when buying these products.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Globally, many public, social, and economic benefits can result from securitization. For instance, the existence of a liquid and efficient secondary securitization market increases the availability and reduces the cost of financing for the primary market lenders. It can also reduce geographical and regional disparities in the availability and cost of borrowing by linking local credit activities to global capital markets. Also, securitization can be used as a way to improve capital allocation and reduce risks to individual institutions and systemic risks within the financial system.

    General Structure and Key Agents Involved in a Securitization
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A typical securitization begins with one (or several) originator having some assets in its book that it wants to divest. The securitization process itself requires several steps, as illustrated in Figure 1. Various agents are involved at different stages of any securitization process.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Issuer and Investors
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Even if ABS have been issued on a basis of a large variety of different underlying risks, their overall structure is rather generic. Everything starts with an originator. It initiates the contracts that will be securitized at the end. In other words, the originator provides a product to a customer, who agrees to make a series of payment over a certain period of time. The present value of these payments (capital and interests) constitutes an asset of the originator. Instead of keeping it in its balance sheet, the originator is now able to move it off balance sheet through the securitization process.

  <h4>
   <i>
    Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   More practically, to issue these new securities, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) is created. This is a passive financial entity, bankruptcy remote, that exists for the sole purpose of purchasing and housing the assets from the originator and issuing securities using the assets as
   <i>
    collateral
   </i>
   . The collateral consists of assets provided to secure an obligation. The name of the securities itself comes from the nature of the collateral: as already mentioned, when the assets are mortgage loans, the securities are collateralized or backed by mortgage loans and so are called
   <i>
    MBS
   </i>
   . When it is a general asset that backs the securities, they are called
   <i>
    ABS
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Once the assets have been transferred from the originator to the SPV, a process called
   <i>
    conveyance
   </i>
   , the SPV is responsible for managing the collateral (asset) and administrating its different cash flows. It is also responsible for designing the securities to be issued. Since the management of the cash flows is passive and tax-free, the whole cash flows are transferred to the investors. Note that, in general, the conveyance of assets from the originator to the SPV has to be conducted in a manner that results in a
   <i>
    true sale
   </i>
   (i.e., legal isolation), in order to remove the assets from the bankruptcy or insolvency of the originator. In particular, if the originator was to become bankrupt or insolvent, a trustee would not be able to reach the transferred assets to satisfy claims of creditors of the originator.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   In summary, after the transfer of the collateral asset to the SPV, the latter issues securities to investors, who, in exchange, pay some money to the SPV in order to buy the securities. Then, the SPV pays all the proceeds from the securities issue to the originator, while the latter will pay the different cash
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   flows coming from the asset during its life to the SPV so that they can be transferred to the investors.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Cash and Synthetic Structures
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In the securitization process described here, the collateral is made of assets from the originator's balance sheet. Some more sophisticated securitization processes also exist without this particular feature, especially in credit risk securitization. The issued securities are usually called
   <i>
    synthetic
   </i>
   (
   <i>
    versus
   </i>
   cash) since the collateral is recreated synthetically.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A standard example is the (cash) collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), based upon a collateral that is a pool of assets, usually comprising loans and debt instruments (but generally nonmortgage assets). The collateral pool can be made of various assets: investment-grade bonds, high-yield bonds, sovereign debt, bank loans, or even tranches of other CDOs. More precisely, a CDO consists of the issue of several notes, also called
   <i>
    tranches
   </i>
   , having different characteristics (maturity, seniority, etc.). The credit risk of the collateral is borne by the investors of the CDO, but the exposure is different according to the tranche. However, CDOs can also be synthetic (funded or unfunded). In this case, the underlying risk is the credit risk associated with a portfolio of credit default swaps signed by the originator and the SPV. In the funded case, the collateral is constituted by the purchase by the SPV of high credit quality financial instruments such as T-bonds with the initial proceeds from the investors. In the unfunded case, there is no collateral as such and the CDO is therefore similar to a swap contract.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   There is an important difference between the cash and synthetic structures coming from the motivation behind the securitization itself: in a standard (cash) securitization, the originator is really at the origins of
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   the transaction, with the idea of removing some assets and risks from its balance sheet and using the capital in an optimal way. In a synthetic case, the motivations may come more naturally from the investors' side, and the securitization is an answer to the demand for specific products.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Agents Involved before the Transaction
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Before the transaction, in addition to the advisor, typically an investment bank designing the overall transaction, and the originator, many other types of agents take part in the structuring of the transaction.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    Advisors and Modeling Firms.
   </b>
   In a standard securitization process, the originator works with an advisor, typically an investment bank. The advisor is here to design the transaction in its every aspect, even the underwriting. It cannot, however, retain any risk. Its role is that of a pure intermediary, making the overall process feasible. This comes at a cost, the fees being typically 1% of the notional amount of the transaction.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In some cases, especially when the underlying risks are not standard (this is usually the case for insurance-linked risks such as natural catastrophe or life), a modeling firm is called upon to help with the pooling of the risk to be securitized and the valuation of those risks.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    Rating Agencies.
   </b>
   The risk of any transaction has to be assessed before it can go through. Rating agencies are firms specialized in the risk assessment. The largest are Moodys, Standard and Poors, and Fitch Ratings. Their role is to provide not only an independent, timely, and prospective opinion on the credit worthiness but also the structural integrity and other attributes of the transaction (and also, more generally, an entity or even a government).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As to achieve the desired credit risk profile for the securities, depending upon the nature of the transaction and the assets involved, the asset pool may need to be supported by some types of credit support, called
   <i>
    credit enhancement
   </i>
   . Credit enhancement mechanisms can take various forms, both from external parties and within the structure of the deal. Internal credit enhancement mechanisms are a form of self-insurance, whereas external credit enhancement mechanisms are third party-guarantees and typically involve the participation of a bond insurer or monoline.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Before the issue, rating agencies have to give an assessment of the risk taken by the investor when buying this particular product, that is, risk of not only losing their investment due to a credit event but also any triggering event underlying the transaction (natural catastrophe in the case of a cat-bond, for instance). Once issued, the rating agencies usually (but not always) monitor the performance of the transaction and adjust the rating accordingly. Ratings are assigned and reviewed by a committee process. The rating will be based upon the structure of the transaction, the quality of the various parties, and the risks underlying the new securities. Obviously, this process involves the knowledge of the models available for these particular risks. Rating agencies may therefore work closely with modeling firms when the underlying is not standard. Various credit enhancement strategies can be used to improve the credit quality of a securitization. The rating system generates many problems as revealed by the credit crisis of 2007–2008. In particular, the use of the same rating system for entities and transactions leads to a confusion among investors. While an
   <i>
    AAA
   </i>
   entity represents a default risk-free entity (this is the case for the G7 countries), an
   <i>
    AAA
   </i>
   transaction (or tranche) is not exempt from risk. The rating of a structure should also include some other forms of risks (liquidity or market value risks, for instance, which are very important especially for highly sophisticated structures).
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Lawyers
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The next step before receiving the approval from the regulatory bodies is to write the legal agreement related to the deal. Even if most advisors have an internal legal department, most of them use an independent law firm to write down the contract, as to avoid any responsibility from the legal point of view. The task of these law firms can be very tricky as it requires the knowledge of various legal frameworks depending on the country, or even the state in the United States.

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Finally, any transaction, before going to the financial markets, has to be approved by the regulatory authority of the relevant country or even the relevant state in the United States. In the United Kingdom, it is the

  <p block-type="Text">
   role of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and in the United States that of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Both are independent nondepartmental public bodies regulating the financial services.

    Insurance-linked Securitization
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The convergence of insurance with the capital markets has not only opened up an alternative channel for insurers to transfer risk, raise capital, and optimize their regulatory reserves but also offered institutions a source of potentially liquid and uncorrelated investment exposure. One of the financial instruments allowing for the cession of insurance-related risks to the capital markets is called
   <i>
    insurance-linked securities
   </i>
   (
   <i>
    ILS
   </i>
   ) [2]. Growth in the ILS market has been steady over the past decade, with a number of different structures, risk layers, and trigger types being introduced. When discussing ILS, one needs to take into account the different structural features for high-frequency–low-severity
   <i>
    versus
   </i>
   low-frequency– high-severity transactions in the nonlife sector, or for
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   regulatory capital, longevity, and extreme mortality trades in the life sector. Motivations also differ according to the structure and the cedant/insured. Catastrophic risk is not only concerned by the securitization process. In theory, any insurance risk, on which policies can be written, can be subject to securitization, and in particular, life insurance risk.
