Until the recent crisis of 2007, the subprime market was the largest part of the nonagency ABS. Several factors can explain their importance; in particular, the growing number of homeowners with heavy debt burden, the aggressiveness of the marketing of subprime issuers, and the lending practices in this market. The characteristics of the ABS with this nonstandard collateral are very different and make them attractive to investors: not only do they offer a higher yield to compensate for the higher credit risk but also the prepayment risk is typically very limited.

It is necessary in structuring a securitization transaction to deal with legal, regulatory, and tax rules that may affect the sale and conveyance of the assets from the originator to the SPV. Another important issue relates to the legal framework governing the creation, maintenance, and operation of special purposes vehicles. Finally, depending on the originator's objectives, the balance sheet effects and accounting treatment and consequences of a particular securitization are essential and will frequently influence the ultimate structure of the transaction. In particular, the question of regulatory capital, or in other words, the amount of provisions to be put aside by financial institutions to be authorized by the regulators to have an activity, is essential and has a huge impact on the structure of transactions, as securitization can be used for capital relief to reduce regulatory capital allocations. In the case of insurance-linked securitization, things can be even more complex.</p>",

It is also a way to lock-in profits by cashing some money today and removing the uncertainty associated with the future cash flows. It can appear as a lower cost source of financing. Obviously, such a process is not for everyone since it is very costly: securitizations are expensive and take time. The more complicated and unusual the transaction is, the more expensive and time consuming it will be. There is also a critical mass to achieve.

The collateral pool can be made of various assets: investment-grade bonds, high-yield bonds, sovereign debt, bank loans, or even tranches of other CDOs. More precisely, a CDO consists of the issue of several notes, also called <i>tranches</i>, having different characteristics (maturity, seniority, etc.). The credit risk of the collateral is borne by the investors of the CDO, but the exposure is different according to the tranche. However, CDOs can also be synthetic (funded or unfunded). In this case, the underlying risk is the credit risk associated with a portfolio of credit default swaps signed by the originator and the SPV. In the funded case, the collateral is constituted by the purchase by the SPV of high credit quality financial instruments such as T-bonds with the initial proceeds from the investors. In the unfunded case, there is no collateral as such and the CDO is therefore similar to a swap contract.</p>",

Once issued, the rating agencies usually (but not always) monitor the performance of the transaction and adjust the rating accordingly. Ratings are assigned and reviewed by a committee process. The rating will be based upon the structure of the transaction, the quality of the various parties, and the risks underlying the new securities. Obviously, this process involves the knowledge of the models available for these particular risks. Rating agencies may therefore work closely with modeling firms when the underlying is not standard. Various credit enhancement strategies can be used to improve the credit quality of a securitization. The rating system generates many problems as revealed by the credit crisis of 2007–2008. In particular, the use of the same rating system for entities and transactions leads to a confusion among investors. While an <i>AAA</i> entity represents a default risk-free entity (this is the case for the G7 countries), an <i>AAA</i> transaction (or tranche) is not exempt from risk. The rating of a structure should also include some other forms of risks (liquidity or market value risks, for instance, which are very important especially for highly sophisticated structures).</p>",
