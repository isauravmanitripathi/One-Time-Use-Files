They were introduced in part to replicate certain portfolio strategies and in part to extend singlename options to portfolios. What these options share is a strong dependence on the correlation structure of the assets, brought about by their nonlinear and path-dependent payoffs. But beyond this similarity, each type has its own distinct payoff tailored to its own risk profile and usage, making each deserving a study of its own. In this second of three articles on Mountain Range options, we look at the Himalayan option. Unlike Atlas options, Himalayans are path dependent, and are usually longer dated than Atlas options.</p>",

As a result, Mountain Range options, specially the path-dependent varieties such as the Himalayan, are calculated using Monte Carlo simulation [1].

Even in simple lognormal models, the sheer size of the correlation matrix can become a challenge. Since for <i>n</i> assets there can be <i>n(n</i> âˆ’ 1<i>)/</i>2 distinct correlations, even for a modest basket of 10 assets, 45 distinct correlations are possible. Moreover, obtaining the pairwise correlations themselves is not straightforward. If, theoretically speaking, there existed <i>n(n</i> âˆ’ 1<i>)/</i>2 traded spread options on each pair, their implied correlations could be used with the spread options as hedges. However, it is unlikely that every pair of assets in a basket would have a traded spread option. Even if they did, their sheer number would make transaction costs prohibitive, even for moderate bidâ€“ask spreads. Hence historical correlations are more often used, even though as with all historical estimates, they are hard to hedge</p>",

For simplicity, we look at a homogeneous portfolio with identical pairwise correlations given by a single number in the simple lognormal model. We look at the effects of removing the best performing assets compared to removing assets in a predetermined order. For high correlations, since basket assets move together, the effects of the \"greediness\" is smallâ€” removing the best performing assets leaves the portfolio with similarly performing assets. So compared to removal by some predetermined order, its effects are small. Increasing the volatility increases the dispersion, and as we next see for the case of lowcorrelation baskets, it may adversely impact the value of the option.</p>",
