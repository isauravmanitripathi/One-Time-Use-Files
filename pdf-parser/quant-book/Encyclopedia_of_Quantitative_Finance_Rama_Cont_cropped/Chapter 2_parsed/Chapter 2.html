    Paul Anthony Samuelson (1915–)
   </i>
   is Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he has taught since 1940. He earned a BA from the University of Chicago in 1935 and his PhD in economics from Harvard University in 1941. He received the John Bates Clark Medal in 1947 and the National Medal of Science in 1996. In 1970, he became the first American to receive the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. His textbook,
   <i>
    Economics,
   </i>
   first published in 1948, and in its 18th edition, is the best-selling and arguably the most influential economics textbook of all time.

   Paul Samuelson is the last great general economist—never again will any one person make such foundational contributions to so many distinct areas of economics. His prolific and profound theoretical contributions over seven decades of published research have been universal in scope, and his ramified influence on the whole of economics has led to foundational contributions in virtually every field of economics, including financial economics. Representing 27 years of scientific writing from 1937 to the middle of 1964, the first two volumes of his
   <i>
    Collected Scientific Papers
   </i>
   contain 129 articles and 1772 pages. These were followed by the publication of the 897-page third volume in 1972, which registers the succeeding seven years' product of 78 articles published when he was between the ages of 49 and 56 [18]. A mere five years later, at the age of 61, Samuelson had published another 86 papers, which fill the 944 pages of the fourth volume. A decade later, the fifth volume appeared with 108 articles and 1064 pages. A glance at his list of publications since 1986 assures us that a sixth and even seventh volume could be filled. That Samuelson paid no heed to the myth of debilitating age in science is particularly well-exemplified in his contributions to financial economics, with all but 6 of his more than 60 papers being published after he had reached the age of 50.

   Samuelson's contribution to quantitative finance, as with mathematical economics generally, has been foundational and wide-ranging: these include reconciling the axioms of expected utility theory first with nonstochastic theories of choice [9] and then with the ubiquitous and practical mean–variance criterion of choice [16], exploring the foundations of diversification [13] and optimal portfolio selection when facing

   fat-tailed, infinite-variance return distributions [14], and, over a span of nearly four decades, analyzing the systematic dependence on age of optimal portfolio strategies, in particular, optimal long-horizon investment strategies, and the improper use of the Law of Large Numbers to arrive at seemingly dominating strategies for the long run [10, 15, 17, 21–27]. In investigating the oft-told tale that investors become systematically more conservative as they get older, Samuelson shows that perfectly rational risk-averse investors with constant relative risk aversion will select the same fraction of risky stocks
   <i>
    versus
   </i>
   safe cash period by period, independently of age, provided that the investment opportunity set is unchanging. Having shown that greater investment conservatism is not an inevitable consequence of aging, he later [24] demonstrates conditions under which such behavior can be optimal: with mean-reverting changing opportunity sets, older investors will indeed be more conservative than in their younger days, provided that they are more risk averse than a growth-optimum, log-utility maximizer. To complete the rich set of agedependent risk-taking behaviors, Samuelson shows that rational investors may actually become less conservative with age, if either they are less risk averse than log or if the opportunity set follows a trending, momentum-like dynamic process. He recently confided that in finance, this analysis is a favorite brainchild of his.

   Published in the same issue of the
   <i>
    Industrial Management Review
   </i>
   , "Proof That Properly Anticipated Prices Fluctuate Randomly" and "Rational Theory of Warrant Pricing" are perhaps the two most influential Samuelson papers in quantitative finance. During the decade before their printed publication in 1965, Samuelson had set down, in an unpublished manuscript, many of the results in these papers and had communicated them in lectures at MIT, Yale, Carnegie, the American Philosophical Society, and elsewhere. In the early 1950s, he supervised a PhD thesis on put and call pricing [5].

   The sociologist or historian of science would undoubtedly be able to develop a rich case study of alternative paths for circulating scientific ideas by exploring the impact of this oral publication of research in rational expectations, efficient markets, geometric Brownian motion, and warrant pricing in the period between 1956 and 1965.

   Samuelson (1965a) and Eugene Fama independently provide the foundation of the Efficient Market
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   theory that developed into one of the most important concepts in modern financial economics. As indicated by its title, the principal conclusion of the paper is that in well-informed and competitive speculative markets, the intertemporal changes in prices will be essentially random. Samuelson has described the reaction (presumably his own as well as that of others) to this conclusion as one of "initial shock—and then, upon reflection, that it is obvious". The argument is as follows: the time series of changes in most economic variables gross national product (GNP, inflation, unemployment, earnings, and even the weather) exhibit cyclical or serial dependencies. Furthermore, in a rational and wellinformed capital market, it is reasonable to presume that the prices of common stocks, bonds, and commodity futures depend upon such economic variables. Thus, the shock comes from the seemingly inconsistent conclusion that in such well-functioning markets the changes in speculative prices should exhibit no serial dependencies. However, once the problem is viewed from the perspective offered in the paper, this seeming inconsistency disappears and all becomes obvious.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Starting from the consideration that in a competitive market, if everyone
   <i>
    knew
   </i>
   that a speculative security was expected to rise in price by more (less) than the required or fair expected rate of return, it would
   <i>
    already
   </i>
   be bid up (down) to negate that possibility, Samuelson postulates that securities will be priced at each point in time so as to yield this fair expected rate of return. Using a backward-in-time induction argument, he proves that the changes in speculative prices around that fair return will form a
   <i>
    martingale
   </i>
   . And this follows no matter how much serial dependency there is in the underlying economic variables upon which such speculative prices are formed. In an informed market, therefore, current speculative prices will already reflect anticipated or forecastable future changes in the underlying economic variables that are relevant to the formation of prices, and this leaves only the unanticipated or unforecastable changes in these variables as the sole source of fluctuations in speculative prices.

   Samuelson is careful to warn the reader against interpreting his mathematically derived theoretical conclusions about markets as empirical statements. Nevertheless, for 40 years, his model has been important to the understanding and interpretation of the empirical results observed in real-world markets. For
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   the most part in those ensuing years, his interpretation of the data is that organized markets where widely owned securities are traded are well approximated as
   <i>
    microefficient,
   </i>
   meaning that the relative pricing of individual securities within the same or very similar asset classes is such that active asset management applied to those similar securities (e.g., individual stock selection) does not earn greater risk-adjusted returns.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   However, Samuelson is discriminating in his assessment of the efficient market hypothesis as it relates to real-world markets. He notes a list of the "few not-very-significant apparent exceptions" to microefficient markets [23, p. 5]. He also expresses belief that there are exceptionally talented people who can probably garner superior risk-corrected returns, and even names a few. He does not see them as offering a practical broad alternative investment prescription for active management since such talents are few and hard to identify. As Samuelson believes strongly in microefficiency of the markets, he expresses doubt about
   <i>
    macro
   </i>
   market efficiency: namely that indeed asset-value "bubbles" do occur.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   There is no doubt that the mainstream of the professional investment community has moved significantly in the direction of Paul Samuelson's position during the 35 years since he issued his challenge to that community to demonstrate widespread superior performance [20]. Indexing as either a core investment strategy or a significant component of institutional portfolios is ubiquitous, and even among those institutional investors who believe they can deliver superior performance, performance is typically measured incrementally relative to an index benchmark and the expected performance increment to the benchmark is generally small compared to the expected return on the benchmark itself. It is therefore with no little irony that as investment practice has moved in this direction, for the last 15 years, academic research has moved in the opposite direction, strongly questioning even the microefficiency case for the efficient market hypothesis. The conceptual basis of these challenges comes from theories of asymmetric information and institutional rigidities that limit the arbitrage mechanisms that enforce microefficiency and of cognitive dissonance and other systematic behavioral dysfunctions among individual investors that purport to distort market prices away from rationally determined asset prices in identified ways. A substantial quantity of empirical
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   evidence has been assembled, but there is considerable controversy over whether it does indeed make a strong case to reject market microefficiency in the Samuelsonian sense. What is not controversial at all is that Paul Samuelson's efficient market hypothesis has had a deep and profound influence on finance research and practice for more than 40 years and all indications are that it will continue to do so well into the future.

   If one were to describe the 1960s as "the decade of capital asset pricing and market efficiency" in view of the important research gains in quantitative finance during then, one need hardly say more than "the Black-Scholes option pricing model" to justify describing the 1970s as "the decade of option and derivative security pricing." Samuelson was ahead of the field in recognizing the arcane topic of option pricing as a rich area for problem choice and solution. By at least the early 1950s, Samuelson had shown that the assumption of an absolute random walk or arithmetic Brownian motion for stock price changes leads to absurd prices for long-lived options, and this was done before his rediscovery of Bachelier's pioneering work [1] in which this very assumption is made. He introduced the alternative process of a "geometric" Brownian motion in which the log of price changes follows a Brownian motion, possibly with a drift. His paper on the rational theory of warrant pricing [12] resolves a number of apparent paradoxes that had plagued the existing mathematical theory of option pricing from the time of Bachelier. In the process (with the aid of a mathematical appendix provided by H. P. McKean, Jr), Samuelson also derives much of what has become the basic mathematical structure of option pricing theory today.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Bachelier [1] considered options that could only be exercised on the expiration date. In modern times, the standard terms for options and warrants permit the option holder to exercise on or before the expiration date. Samuelson coined the terms
   <i>
    European
   </i>
   option to refer to the former and
   <i>
    American
   </i>
   option to refer to the latter. As he tells the story, to get a practitioner's perspective in preparation for his research, he went to New York to meet with a well-known put and call dealer (there were no traded options exchanges until 1973) who happened to be Swiss. Upon his identifying himself and explaining what he had in mind, Samuelson was quickly told, "You are wasting your time—it takes a
   <i>
    European
   </i>
   mind to understand options." Later on, when writing
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   his paper, Samuelson thus chose the term
   <i>
    European
   </i>
   for the relatively simple(-minded)-to-value option contract that can only be exercised at expiration and
   <i>
    American
   </i>
   for the considerably more-(complex)-tovalue option contract that could be exercised early, any time on or before its expiration date.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Although real-world options are almost always of the American type, published analyses of option pricing prior to his 1965 paper focused exclusively on the evaluation of European options and therefore did not include the extra value to the option from the right to exercise early.

   The most striking comparison to make between the Black–Scholes option pricing theory and Samuelson's
   <i>
    rational theory
   </i>
   [12] is the formula for the option price. The Samuelson partial differential equation for the option price is the same as the corresponding equation for the Black–Scholes option price
   <i>
    if
   </i>
   one sets the Samuelson parameter for the expected return on the underlying stock equal to the riskless interest rate minus the dividend yield and sets the Samuelson parameter for the expected return on the option equal to the riskless interest rate. It should, however, be underscored that the mathematical equivalence between the two formulas with the redefinition of parameters is purely a formal one. The Samuelson model simply posits the expected returns for the stock and option. By employing a dynamic hedging or replicating portfolio strategy, the Black–Scholes analysis derives the option price without the need to know either the expected return on the stock or the required expected return on the option. Therefore, the fact that the Black–Scholes option price satisfies the Samuelson formula implies neither that the expected returns on the stock and option are equal nor that they are equal to the riskless rate of interest. Furthermore, it should also be noted that Black–Scholes pricing of options does not require knowledge of investors' preferences and endowments as is required, for example, in the sequel Samuelson and Merton [28] warrant pricing paper. The "rational theory" put forward in 1965 is thus clearly a "miss" with respect to the Black–Scholes development. However, as this analysis shows, it is just as clearly a "near miss". See [6, 19] for a formal comparison of the two models.
