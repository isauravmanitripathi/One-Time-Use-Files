# **Managed CDO**

## **General Definition**

A managed (or "active") *collateralized debt obligation* (*CDO*) is a large-scale securitization transaction that is actively arranged and administered to unbundle, transform, and diversify financial risks from a dynamic reference portfolio of one or more creditsensitive asset classes (associated with different creditors, countries, and/or industry sectors). Although the type(s) of asset(s) in the reference portfolio are known and fixed through the life of the CDO, the underlying collateral of a managed CDO is variable.

## **Types of Managed CDOs**

In general, CDO Managers operate under investment guidelines that are defined in the governing documents of the CDO transaction. Managers adjust the investment exposure over time to meet a prespecified risk–return profile and/or achieve a certain degree of diversification in response to changes in risk sensitivity, market sentiment, and/or timing preferences. These guidelines specify parameters for the initial portfolio (during the "ramp-up phase", see below) but not the exact composition, for example, a minimum average rating, a minimum average yield, a maximum average maturity, and a minimum degree of diversification. As opposed to a static CDO, managers monitor and, if necessary, trade assets within the reference portfolio in order to inform decisions about asset purchases and sales that protect the collateral value from impairment due to deterioration in credit quality [6]. For further references, see [1–3, 5, 7, 8]. "Lightly managed" reference portfolios allow for some substitution of assets in the context of a defensive management strategy, while a "fully managed" CDO suggests a more active role of managers subject to limits and investment guidelines that are determined by the issuers, rating agencies, and different levels of risk tolerance of investors at inception. In the event of the issuer's insolvency or default, managers are charged with maximizing recoveries on behalf of investors. However, investors in managed CDOs do not know what specific assets CDO managers will invest in, recognizing that those assets will change over time as managers alter the composition of the reference portfolio. Thus, investors face both credit risk and the risk of poor management.

The majority of CDOs are managed and, in many instances, involve compounded structured finance claims. While standard CDOs use the same offbalance sheet structuring technology as *asset-backed securities* (*ABS s*) (e.g., securities that are themselves repackaged obligations on mortgages, consumer loans, home equity lines of credit, and credit card receivables), their reference portfolios typically include a wider and more diverse range of assets, such as senior secured bank loans, high-yield bonds, and *credit default swaps* (*CDS s*). In particular, the variable portfolio structure of managed CDOs is particularly amenable to refinance ABSs, emerging market bonds, or even other CDOs (to produce CDOs of CDOs, also called *CDO*2), as collateral assets in the so-called "pools-of-pools" structures.

## **Managed CDOs Have an Arbitrage Proposition**

Managed CDOs are structured for *arbitrage* purposes. As opposed to *balance sheet* CDOs, where issuers unload defined asset exposure to third parties in order to change their balance sheet composition or debt maturity structure, in *arbitrage* transactions, the ability to trade a dynamic reference portfolio helps managers focus on the pool's prospects for appreciation with the view of realizing economic gains while limiting downside risks. These gains result from the pricing mismatch between investment returns from reference assets (in the case of a *cash flow* structure) or credit protection premia on exposures (in the case of a *synthetic* structure) and lower financing cost of generally higher rated liabilities in the form of issued CDO securities. While cash flow CDOs, the most common type of CDOs, pay off liabilities with the cash generated from interest and principal payments, synthetic CDOs sell credit protection (together with various third-party guarantees) to create partially funded and highly leveraged investment on the performance of designated credit exposures (without actually purchasing the reference assets).

## **The Life of a Managed CDO**

The life of a managed CDO can be divided into three distinct phases (Figure 1). During the "ramp-up

phase" (which lasts about one year), asset managers invest the proceeds from CDO placement (possibly after an initial warehousing period when the sponsor finances the buildup of the asset portfolio before securitizing). During the subsequent "reinvestment phase" (up to five years or longer), managers reinvest cash flows as well as trade the reference portfolio within the prescribed guidelines. Cash flows generated by the assets are used to pay back investors generally in sequential order from the senior investors, who hold the highest rated (typically "AAA"-rated) securities, to the "equity investors" who bear the first-loss risk and generally hold unrated securities. In transactions with *revolving* pools, portfolio assets can be replaced (e.g., credit card and trade receivables, corporate bonds) and balances are adjustable up to maximum limits without amortization schedule of principal. In contrast, managers of *substituting* pools incorporate new assets (within defined credit parameters) as original liabilities are paid down (e.g., corporate bonds, some residential mortgages, and consumer loans), but balances remain fixed. In the "amortization phase", the reference portfolio matures (or is prepaid/sold) and investors receive some or all of their principal investment back according to the seniority of their claim.

## **Lessons from the Credit Crisis**

Although rating agencies have developed stress tests to evaluate the resilience of dynamic portfolio structures, the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis demonstrated that managed CDOs might create incentive problems [4]. Existing quality and coverage tests on the underlying collaterals are designed to trigger amortization scenarios if asset performance deteriorates. However, CDO managers can manipulate these

tests to avoid early amortization. In response to a general repricing of risk, dwindling investor demand increased risk premia and curtailed the capacity of CDO managers to offset higher funding costs. Faced with rising liability pressures and without real buyers available, managers of "blind pools" could "double up" by opting for riskier positions and greater leverage to preserve own arbitrage gains within predefined investment guidelines, which were gradually undermined by the disassociation of ratings and structured asset performance. In principle, if transaction costs are ignored, risk-neutral managers would not benefit from dynamic asset allocation by substituting badly performing assets. Under worsening credit conditions, better asset performance comes at a premium, making it more expensive to weed out distressed assets. Therefore, CDO managers are no better off than before once they divert funds to safer but more costly assets (or accept higher hedging costs).
