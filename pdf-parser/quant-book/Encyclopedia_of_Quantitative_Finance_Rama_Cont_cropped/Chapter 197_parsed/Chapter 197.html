   Jarrow-Lando-Turnbull Model
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The credit-risk model of Jarrow, Lando, and Turnbull is based on a Markov chain with finite state space, modeled in discrete or continuous time. Economically, it relies on the appealing interpretation of using different rating classes, which are represented by the states of the Markov chain. Presumably, it is the first credit-risk model that incorporates rating information into the valuation of defaultable bonds and credit derivatives. An advantage of modeling the credit-rating process is that the resulting bond prices explicitly depend on the issuer's initial rating and possible rating transitions in the future. Moreover, the model allows to price derivatives whose payoffs depend on the credit rating of some reference bond, an application that is not straightforward in intensitybased models or structural-default models.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Technically, the model is formulated on a filtered probability space with a money-market account
   <math display="inline">
    B = \{B(t)\}_{0 \le t \le T}
   </math>
   as numéraire. The state space of the underlying Markov chain is denoted by
   <math display="inline">
    S =
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    \{1,\ldots,K\}
   </math>
   , where state K represents default. The other states are identified with rating classes that are ordered according to increasing default risk, that is, state 1 represents the best rating. Transition probabilities from one state to another are specified via a probability matrix
   <math display="inline">
    \boldsymbol{Q}
   </math>
   in discrete time and using a generator matrix
   <math display="inline">
    \Lambda
   </math>
   in continuous time. Multiple defaults are excluded by making the default state absorbing, which corresponds to specific choices of the last rows of
   <math display="inline">
    \boldsymbol{O}
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    \boldsymbol{\Lambda}
   </math>
   , respectively. The original model achieves a high level of tractability by imposing the following assumptions: existence of a unique equivalent martingale measure, independence of risk-free interest rates and credit migrations under the martingale measure, and a constant recovery
   <math display="inline">
    R
   </math>
   paid at the maturity of the defaulted bonds. It is further suggested in
   <math display="inline">
    [8]
   </math>
   that historical transition probabilities could be adjusted by some deterministic, time-dependent, proportional risk premium to derive the required transition matrix
   <math display="inline">
    \tilde{\boldsymbol{Q}}
   </math>
   or generator matrix
   <math display="inline">
    \hat{\Lambda}
   </math>
   under the martingale measure. Then,
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   -year survival probabilities are expressed in terms of this martingale measure, under which defaultable bonds, futures, and derivatives on risky bonds are priced by computing their expected discounted payoff. To be more precise, let us briefly

  <p block-type="Text">
   Most results derived in the discrete model find their analog in the continuous version of the model. More complicated in a continuous framework is the derivation of martingale probabilities, specified by the generator matrix ˜ . For the construction of this matrix, [8] presents an implicit calibration method that starts with a historical estimation of . On the basis of the paradigm of choosing ˜
   <i>
    close
   </i>
   to the historical , a proportional risk premium is introduced, which is calibrated to observed bond prices.

  <p block-type="Text">
   The original references of the presented methodology are [9] and [8], and an excellent textbook summary is Chapter 12 of [4]. An introduction to Markov chains is given in [1] and [3]. Estimation procedures of the historical intensity matrix are studied in [10] and [7]. Considering generalizations of the model, let us mention [5] for stochastic recovery rates, [2, 12], and [13], for transition probabilities explained by state variables, and [11] for a different risk premium. Finally, a multifirm extension using a stochastic time change is presented in [6].
