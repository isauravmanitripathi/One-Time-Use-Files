    Loan Valuation

  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A loan is an agreement in which one party, called a
   <i>
    lender
   </i>
   , provides the use of property, the
   <i>
    principal
   </i>
   , to another party, the
   <i>
    borrower
   </i>
   . The borrower customarily promises to return the principal after a specified period along with payment for its use, called
   <i>
    interest
   </i>
   [3]. When the property loaned is cash, the documentation of the agreement between borrower and lender is called a
   <i>
    promissory note
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Although cash loans can take many forms, traditionally, banks and other financial institutions are the primary lenders of cash and businesses, organizations, and individuals are the borrowers. Most loans to corporations share a common set of structural characteristics [2, 5].

  <p block-type="ListGroup">
   <ul>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     1. Interest on loans is typically paid quarterly at a rate specified relative to some reference rate such as LIBOR (i.e., L + 250 bp).a Thus, loans have
     <i>
      floating-rate
     </i>
     coupons whose absolute values are not known with certainty except over the next quarter.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     2. Often the firm's assets or receivables are pledged against the borrowed principal. Because of this, their recovery rates are generally higher than corporate bonds, which are most commonly unsecured.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     3. Most loans are prepayable on any coupon date at par, although some agreements contain a prepayment penalty or have a noncall period. The loan prepayment feature ensures that loan prices rarely exceed several points above par.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     4. Finally, unlike bonds which are public securities, loans are private credit agreements. Thus, access to firm fundamentals and loan terms may be limited and loan contracts are less standardized. It is not uncommon to find "nonstandard" covenants or other structural features catering to specific needs of borrowers or investors.

   </ul>

  <p block-type="Text">
   Loan valuation concerns the amount of interest that a lender requires for use of the property or an investor will charge for purchasing the loan agreement. That valuation depends on several factors, such as

   Although the bulk of the loans outstanding are rated investment-grade or better, these loans trade very infrequently because of their high credit quality and lack of price differentiation. In fact, most loans that trade after origination are those made by banks to borrowers having speculative-grade credit ratings. These loans, made to high-yield firms are typically referred to as
   <i>
    leveraged loans
   </i>
   , though the exact definition varies slightly among market participants.b

    <li block-type="ListItem">
     2.
     <b>

    Loan Pricing
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Like bonds, loans contain risk of default; an obligor may fail to make timely payments of interest and/or principal. Thus, the notion of a credit spread to LIBOR has been used to characterize the riskiness of loans, where the credit spread,
   <math display="inline">
    s
   </math>
   , to LIBOR is calculated as
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    V = \sum_{t=1}^{4n} \frac{c_t/4}{\left(1 + \frac{r_t + s}{4}\right)^t} + \frac{F}{\left(1 + \frac{r_{4n} + s}{4}\right)^{4n}} \quad (1)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    V
   </math>
   is the market value of the loan,
   <math display="inline">
    c_t
   </math>
   is the coupon (LIBOR + contractual spread),
   <math display="inline">
    r_t
   </math>
   is the spot rate for maturity
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   LIBOR rates, and
   <math display="inline">
    F
   </math>
   is the face value of the loan to be repaid at maturity. Loan coupons are generally paid quarterly and then reset relative to LIBOR and this is reflected in equation 1. Using equation 1, we can calculate a credit spread for any loan whose market price is known.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   One problem with equation 1 for loan valuation is that it fails to account for the fact that loans, unlike bonds, are typically prepayable at par on any given coupon date. The loan prepayment option creates uncertainty in the expected pattern of cash flows and complicates comparisons of value among loans based on their credit spreads. Pricing the prepayment option has proved difficult because of its dependence
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   on the evolution of an obligor's credit state and the changing market costs of borrowing. For example, if a firm's credit improves or the loan rate over LIBOR decreases, the likelihood of prepayment increases; the borrower can refinance at a lower rate. Conversely, if a borrower's credit deteriorates or lending rates increase, it will not be advantages for the borrower to refinance.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   To account for the prepayment option, we price the loans using a credit-state-dependent backward induction method.&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; To illustrate, consider pricing a term loan with face value
   <math display="inline">
    F
   </math>
   , intermediate floatingrate coupon payments of
   <math display="inline">
    c_t
   </math>
   , and a maturity at time
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   , to a borrower of known credit quality,
   <math display="inline">
    J
   </math>
   . Specifically, Figure 1 displays pricing lattices for a five-year loan to a double-B rated (i.e.,
   <math display="inline">
    J = BB
   </math>
   ) obligor having a coupon of LIBOR
   <math display="inline">
    + 3\%,^d
   </math>
   and face value of 100 at maturity.&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Figure 1(a) shows how the obligor's credit state evolves over time. In the lattice, probabilities are assigned reflecting transitions from each node at time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   to all nodes at
   <math display="inline">
    t + 1
   </math>
   . Thus, the probability of being at a given node will be conditional upon all the previous transitions. In practice, ratings transition probabilities are based on historical data from credit rating agencies,&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt; and these are typically modified by the current market price of risk to produce risk-neutral ratings transition matrices.g,h
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Having calculated transition probabilities between all future nodes, we then apply the backward induction method. At maturity
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   , the borrower pays the principal plus coupon,
   <math display="inline">
    F + c_T

(b) Calculation of node values using backward induction, whereby values at each non-defaulted node are the coupon value at that node plus the sum of the conditional cash flows from the later date, discounted one period at forward LIBOR. In the example in (b), we assume a refinancing penalty of

  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   value in default
   <math display="inline">
    R \ast F

   . Those cash flows are discounted back to each node at the previous period using forward LIBOR at

    j
   </math>
   , and
   <math display="inline">
    j = (AAA, AA, \dots, CCC)
   </math>
   we calculate an induced value,
   <math display="inline">
    v_{i,j}

   , as
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    v_{(i,j)} = \min\left\{ \left( \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{f_{i+1,i}}{4} \right)} \sum_{k=D}^{AAA} (P_{j,k,i} * v_{i+1,k}) \right) + c_i, K_i \right\}, \tag{2}

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">

    P_{i,k,i}

   is the probability of migrating from state j to state k from time i to

   <math display="inline">
    f_i

   is the forward LIBOR rate from time i to

    K_i

   ,&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; and
   <math display="inline">
    v_{T,i} = F + c_T
   </math>
   . Thus, at each node
   <math display="inline">
    i, j
   </math>
   we compute the induced value, compare it with the terminal value,
   <math display="inline">
    K_i
   </math>

   <math display="inline">
    v_{i,j}

   to the lesser of the two. In other words, if the induced value exceeds the terminal value, the loan is effectively repaid and terminates at
   <math display="inline">
    i, i

   . Also, if the loan defaults at time
   <math display="inline">
    i
   </math>
   , the loan terminates with a value
   <math display="inline">
    v_{i,D} = R * F

    v_{i,j}

   Although equation 2 is useful for calculating prices of illiquid loans and for estimating the coupon premiums to charge for new loans, it is less useful for evaluating relative value among existing loans, which are better assessed using credit spreads. In fact, we can calculate the credit spread for a loan by discounting its expected nondefault cash flows by a constant amount over the LIBOR curve such that the discounted value matches its current market price. For all nondefault cash flows at a given time, the borrower will either prepay the principal and terminate, or pay a coupon and continue. The prepayment region in the time-and-credit-state lattice can be determined using the values of
   <math display="inline">
    v_{i,j}
   </math>
   in equation 2. The probability of prepaying at period

   Revolving lines of credit are priced by assuming that the fraction of the loan drawn at a particular time, called the
   <i>
    usage
   </i>
   , is directly related changes to the obligor's credit quality. In other words, if a borrower's credit rating improves, it can access credit more cheaply and is also less likely to draw on existing lines of credit. Conversely, a borrower with deteriorating credit will likely draw on the credit lines it obtained when more highly rated. In this framework, usage can be interpreted as credit-dependent face value. Thus, in the equations above the face value is modified by

   &lt;sup&gt;a.&lt;/sup&gt;LIBOR stands for London interbank offered rate, which roughly corresponds to the interest rate charged between banks when lending large amounts of US dollars outside the United States. The coupon rate for a given quarter is set at the beginning of the period. For example, the

    L + 250
