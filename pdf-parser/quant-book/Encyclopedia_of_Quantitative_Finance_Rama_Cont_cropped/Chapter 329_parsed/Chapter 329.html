    Execution Costs
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Execution costs are the difference in value between an ideal trade and what was actually done. The execution cost of a single, completed trade is typically the difference between the final average trade price, including commissions, fees, and all other costs, and a suitable
   <i>
    benchmark
   </i>
   price representing a hypothetical perfectly executed trade. The sign is taken so that positive cost represents loss of value: buying for a higher price or selling for a lower price. If a trade is not completed either for endogeneous reasons (e.g., the price moves away from an acceptable level) or for exogeneous reasons (a trader gets sick or a system fails), then some value must be assigned to the unexecuted shares. The cost of a portfolio transaction, or a series of transactions, is computed as a suitably weighted average of the costs of the individual executions.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Some of the costs of trading are direct and predictable, such as broker commissions, taxes, and exchange fees. Although these costs can be significant, they are commonly not included in the quantitative analysis of execution costs. "Indirect" costs include all other sources of price discrepancy, such as limited liquidity (market impact) and price motion due to volatility. These are much more difficult to characterize and measure and are much more amenable to improvement. Since the technology of cost measurement is most advanced for equity trading, we shall use that language; cost measurement for other asset classes is also very interesting, but less developed.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The benchmark is commonly taken to be the
   <i>
    arrival price
   </i>
   , that is, the quoted market price in effect at the time the order was released to the trading desk. Using that benchmark is equivalent to saying that a perfect trade, one with zero execution cost, would be one that executed instantaneously at the arrival price. The cost measured using the arrival price benchmark is called the
   <i>
    implementation shortfall
   </i>
   , a term introduced by Perold [10]: "on paper you transact instantly, costlessly, and in unlimited quantities
   <i>
    ...
   </i>
   simply look at the current bid and ask, and consider the deal done at the average of the two."

   For example, suppose that an overnight investment decision assumed that a large quantity of stock could be purchased at the previous day's closing price of $50 per share; if the trade was fully completed at
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   an average price of $50.25, then the execution cost would be reported as 25 cents per share. However, execution costs are only part of the picture: if the stock closed that day at $51, then the trade would be successful despite its positive cost; a na¨ıve cost model might assign $1 profit to the portfolio manager and $0.25 cost to the trader. Execution costs can be negative, for example, if the price dropped in the course of a purchase program and the asset was acquired for a lower price than that anticipated; or, in the above example, if the benchmark price were the day's closing price. The forecast execution costs on any particular order typically have a very high degree of uncertainty, due to market volatility and other random effects.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A well-calibrated model for execution costs is an important part of the quantitative investment process. At a minimum, it is a tool for the portfolio manager to evaluate the performance of his or her trading desk and external brokers: were the results achieved on a particular execution compatible with the costs estimated from the pretrade model? Furthermore, anticipated transaction costs should be a component of the portfolio formation decisions: turnover should be minimized, and expected transition costs should be incorporated in the portfolio construction model along with expected alpha. Grinold and Kahn [6] discuss in depth the use of transaction cost models in investment management.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   This article is divided into three parts, corresponding to the order in which three aspects should be addressed in designing an investment process, although the order, from the point of view of a single trade, is chronologically the reverse. First, we shall look at posttrade cost reporting, then at optimal trading to minimize execution costs, and finally at pretrade cost estimation.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    Posttrade Reporting
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   "If you can not measure it, you can not improve it," said Lord Kelvin. The first step toward reducing execution costs in any program is to measure them systematically. For each trade executed, the cost should be reported relative to a collection of benchmarks. In addition, the cost statistics should be computed across all trades in a suitable time period (daily or weekly) and broken down by any relevant parameters: primary market, size of trade, market capitalization of stock, and so on.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As noted above, the most common benchmark is the pretrade arrival price. Another common choice is the "volume-weighted average price" (VWAP), taken across the time interval during which the trade was executed. Although this most likely does not correspond directly to an investment goal, it is a popular benchmark for assessing the quality of the execution, because it largely filters out the effects of volatility. One would typically also use a posttrade price, for example, the closing price on the day during which the trade was executed. Typical posttrade reporting systems display the execution price relative to all of these benchmarks: before, during, and after trading.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   When aggregating cost numbers across a diverse variety of trades, the individual cost numbers should be weighted so that the result is representative of the overall change in portfolio value. If the individual costs are measured in cents per share, then they should be weighted using the number of shares in each individual trade. If the individual costs are measured in basis points, then they should be weighted using the dollar value of each trade.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   If a pretrade cost model has been developed, then the realized costs should also be compared with the forecast values, both on the level of individual execution, and on the overall portfolio level. This will help to identify trades that may have been badly executed as well as in maintaining accurate calibration of the pretrade model.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In addition to the average, it is useful to report the standard deviation of the costs. This is useful as a reality check for the significance of the mean. For example, if the sample standard deviation were 25 basis points on 100 independent trades, then the expected error in the sample mean would be 2.5 basis points and a change of one or two basis points in the mean cost would not be significant. The standard deviation should also be weighted by trade size; the most reasonable weights are the same that are used for the average cost. The standard deviation does not have good properties under subdivision.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Ideally, aggregate cost numbers would be reported so that the result is indifferent to subdivision of trade blocks, but this is often not possible. For example, suppose that 100 000 shares are purchased throughout the day; a natural benchmark price would be the day's opening price. However, if this block were considered as 40 000 shares in the morning and 60 000 shares in the afternoon, the arrival price for the second block would be the midday price, and the overall reported
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   cost would be lower. The choice can be made only with knowledge of the investor's overall goals. This difficulty does not arise with a VWAP benchmark or with a benchmark price at a fixed time such as at the close.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Additional difficulties in cost reporting come from price limits and incomplete trades. Suppose that a buy order is put in for a stock currently trading at $50, but a condition is imposed that no shares are to be bought at a price higher than $50.05. It will then be certain that the price impact on this trade will be at most 5 cents per share, but it may be that only a small fraction of the requested shares are actually executed. If the limit is below the initial price, the situation may be even more extreme. Similar difficulties arise if the trade is halted for other reasons.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The solution to this difficulty rests on the valuation of unexecuted shares, but there is no simple rule. The most straightforward would be to imagine that the unexecuted shares were purchased at the day's closing price. In practice, this rule is far too stringent and does not take account of the variety of possible reasons the trade might have been halted. Trade cost reporting must take account of the entire investment process.
  </p>

   <b>
    Optimal Trading
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Once a system is in place for measuring and reporting trade costs, and after it has been agreed what criteria define a good trade or collection of trades, then one can design optimal strategies to meet investment goals. "Best execution" is not only advantageous to investors but also is required by regulation in most markets. The most important goal is always to reduce mean execution cost, which is largely due to market impact and uncaptured short-term alpha. One also often desires to reduce the standard deviation of trade costs in order to reduce the overall investment volatility [5].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Reducing costs is achieved by searching for liquidity in "space" as well as in time, accessing as many pools of potential liquidity and as many potential counterparties as possible for each piece of the trade. This includes routing to nonexchange trading venues such as "dark pools" and block crossing services when possible. Rapid changes in market structure make this increasingly complicated (see [7, Appendix] for a discussion of the US equities markets).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Accessing liquidity in time means being willing to slow trading to give potential counterparties the opportunity to appear in the market. If short-term price drift is not expected to be significant, then average trading costs can generally be reduced by trading more slowly.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Other aspects of trading push for rapid trading, most significantly anticipated price drift and market volatility: "To trade a list of stocks efficiently, investors must balance opportunity costs and execution price risk against market impact costs. Trading each stock quickly minimizes lost alpha and price uncertainty due to delay, but impatient trading incurs maximum impact. In contrast, trading more patiently over a longer period reduces market impact but incurs larger opportunity costs and short-term execution price risk" [1]. The actual trade schedule is determined by using a quantitative balance of all of these factors. This schedule may need to be dynamically adapted depending on the observed liquidity or other market components. For a portfolio, correlation between the assets should be included in addition to the volatility of each one, and the schedule may need to maintain strict neutrality to a market index or other risk factors.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In practice, optimal strategies for a mean–variance trade-off, and strategies that are calculated to optimize expected cost in the presence of short-term drift, are generally similar: at the beginning of each execution, rapid trading reduces the exposure to

   volatility or alpha, then the trading slows to reduce overall impact costs (Figure 1, from [2]). The most important question is the overall speed of the execution: should it be completed in minutes, hours, or days? Regardless of the model, an approximate quantitative model for execution costs is an essential element of this decision.
  </p>

   <b>
    Pretrade Cost Estimation
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Once a measurement system has run long enough to generate a useful amount of data, one can begin to think about developing an analytic model. The goal of the model is to forecast the execution cost to be expected on any anticipated trade, along with an estimate of the uncertainty in the forecast. In its most general form, such a model must contain a full explanation of how trading in markets affects prices. This is a rich area of research with a large literature (see [9] for an extensive survey; see [4, 8] for more subtle models). Thus, one typically poses the problem in the more prosaic terms of estimating the future in terms of past data.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The goal is to give the predicted cost
   <i>
    C
   </i>
   (in cents per share or basis points) in terms of input variables, including, at a minimum, the number of shares traded
   <i>
    X
   </i>
   and the daily volume
   <i>
    V
   </i>
   of the stock (either historical average or volume on the day of trading), and the effective duration
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   over which the trade was executed as in Figure 1. To normalize across many different stocks, one should also include properties such as volatility
   <i>
    σ
   </i>
   , and, perhaps, market capitalization, primary exchange or country, and other economic parameters. In addition, one might include trade information such as the anticipated short-term alpha, and the algorithm or other means that were used to trade the stock.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   For any proposed trade, the pretrade model predicts the cost on the basis of cost that was measured on "similar" trades in the past. "Supervised learning" algorithms [11] could, in theory, be used to carry out this classification. In practice, because the dimension of the parameter space is so large, there may be no, or very few, trades that are sufficiently similar to the proposed ones in all variables. This argues for a regression approach in which a specific functional form is proposed, calibrated to data, and evaluated using standard statistical tests of significance.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The most detailed of such a study was carried out by Almgren et al. [3]. This model is based on separation of the cost into a "permanent" and a "temporary" component. Although both components contribute to the realized cost on every trade, it is useful to calibrate each separately. The calibration relies on three observed prices: (i)
   <math display="inline">
    S_{\text{pre}}
   </math>
   denotes the arrival price, that is, a market price just before the order begins trading; typically, this would be the bid-ask midpoint before the first execution; (ii)
   <math display="inline">
    S_{\text{exec}}
   </math>
   is the actual average price for which the order finally executes, which is, of course, the quantity of most interest to the trader; and (iii)
   <math display="inline">
    S_{\text{post}}
   </math>
   denotes a market price just after the order has finished executing, possibly with a short time lag to allow transient effects to dissipate.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The model of Almgren
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [3] measures two quantities
   <math display="inline">
    I
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    J
   </math>
   , for permanent and temporary impact, respectively. For a buy order, these are
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    I = \log \frac{S_{\text{post}}}{S_{\text{pre}}} \approx \frac{S_{\text{post}} - S_{\text{pre}}}{S_{\text{pre}}} \tag{1}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">

   (2)
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   and for a sell order, the signs would be reversed. The approximate equalities are valid for moderatesized orders, for which the price does not move more than a few percent during execution. These quantities represent price changes relative to the pretrade price, as fractions of that benchmark.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The permanent component of cost is interpreted as the net displacement of the market due to the buy-sell imbalance introduced by this particular trade. The simplest model sets
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    I = \gamma \sigma \frac{X}{V} + \langle \text{noise} \rangle \tag{3}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In this expression, we normalize the trade size
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   by the day's volume V, so
   <math display="inline">
    X/V
   </math>
   is the trade size as a fraction of a typical day's flow. We also normalize the impact I by the volatility
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma
   </math>
   , so that we represent the impact as a fraction of a typical amount that the stock moves without our trading. The coefficient
   <math display="inline">
    \gamma
   </math>
   is taken to be constant across all stocks, with widely varying daily volumes and volatilities. The noise term arises from intraday volatility: the actual cost experienced on any particular trade may be very different from the mean prediction from the model.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In this form of the model, the permanent impact is linear in the total number of shares traded. This model is particularly convenient for theoretical modeling but must be justified by empirical analysis of real-trade data. Almgren et al. [3] found a reasonable agreement with their data, but other recent empirical studies have suggested that the linear form might not be justified.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The temporary impact component of cost is interpreted as the additional premium that must be paid for execution in a finite time, above a suitably prorated fraction of the permanent cost. We model it as
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    J = \frac{I}{2} + \eta \sigma \left(\frac{X}{VT}\right)^{\beta} + \langle \text{noise} \rangle \qquad (4)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   represents the effective duration of the trade as a fraction of the trading day. Thus,
   <math display="inline">
    X/VT
   </math>
   represents the "participation rate" or the fraction of market flow that this trade constitutes during the time that it is active. The factor
   <math display="inline">
    1/2
   </math>
   on the permanent cost component represents the fraction of posttrade impact that is paid on the trade itself. As for the permanent cost, the impact cost is expressed as a fraction of typical volatility; the coefficient
   <math display="inline">
    \eta
   </math>
   is taken constant across all stocks. Other factors such as bid-ask spread and market capitalization were not determined to be significant in US equity markets.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Almgren et al. [3] calibrate this model to a large sample of the US equity trades using a two-step procedure. First, the permanent impact term
   <math display="inline">
    I
   </math>
   is calibrated, testing the hypothesis of linear impact and estimating the value of
   <math display="inline">
    \gamma
   </math>
   . Next, the temporary impact term
   <math display="inline">
    J
   </math>
   is calibrated, determining values for the exponent
   <math display="inline">
    \beta
   </math>
   and the coefficient
   <math display="inline">
    \eta
   </math>
   . A key aspect of the verification is characterization of the error terms to verify that volatility is an adequate explanation for the residuals. The result has
   <math display="inline">
    \beta \approx 0.6
   </math>
   , which is roughly compatible with the earlier square-root models [12], as well as values for the coefficients
   <math display="inline">
    \gamma
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    \eta
   </math>
   . For trades that are a few percent of daily volume executed across several hours, the predicted impact costs are tens of basis points.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   A number of factors make such models at best very approximate. The first is the extremely low values of
   <math display="inline">
    R^2
   </math>
   in the regression, typically around a few percent at best. That is, the ability of the model to predict the cost of any single trade is very poor, because market volatility due to other trading activity is usually very large. The second, is
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   the difficulty of the model in distinguishing market impact from alpha: did the price move up because the buy program impacted the price or was the trade executed because the manager correctly anticipated a price rise? A third difficulty is difference in behavior between small and large trades: although the model claims to be universally valid, in practice, a model developed for small trades gives poor results on large trades.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In any particular application, the model should be critically evaluated by the user and recalibrated and extended as necessary. Despite its intrinsic difficulties and limitations, this model and extensions are extremely useful to give approximate anticipated cost values for pretrade planning, optimal trade scheduling, and posttrade evaluation.
