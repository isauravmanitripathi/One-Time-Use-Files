   A
   <i>
    hedge fund
   </i>
   is a private investment fund that pools money from a limited number of qualified investors and may use leverage to take long and short positions in various financial instruments. The first hedge fund was created by Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949, which was designed to invest in equity long positions hedged through short positions.a
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Owing to flexible trading strategies, incentivealigned structures, low correlations with traditional asset classes, and loose regulatory oversight, hedge funds have gained popularity in the past decade. In 2007, it has been estimated that there were more than 9000 hedge funds worldwide with assets of about $2.0 trillion under management, compared with only $39 billion in 1990.b Initially, most investments in hedge funds were made by high-net-worth individuals. Of late, institutional investors are increasingly investing in hedge funds.

  <h1>
   <b>
    Structure
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Hedge funds are normally organized as limited partnerships for onshore funds in a country like the United States. Under the limited partnership, the investment manager acts as the general partner while investors are limited partners; offshore hedge funds are organized as corporations without a limit on the number of investors.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Offshore hedge funds are often registered in offshore tax havens such as Cayman Island, the British Virgin Island, Bermuda, and Bahamas [31].
  </p>
  <h1>
   <b>
    Fees
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Hedge funds usually charge both asset management fees, and incentive fees. The management fee is typically 1–2% of assets under management, while the incentive fee is typically 20% of the profit. The incentive fee feature makes hedge funds different from mutual funds and offers better incentive alignment between the managers and investors (see [25]).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The minimum rate above which the incentive fee can be charged is called the
   <i>
    hurdle rate
   </i>
   . It could be zero, the T-Bill rate, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or some fixed benchmark.
  </p>
  <h1>

  <p block-type="Text">
   This is a provision under which a manager has to recoup the previous losses before the incentive fee can be charged, that is, the cumulative returns have to be above the hurdle rate in order to collect an incentive fee. Further, it is possible that the manager could "owe" the investors a rebate of fees charged in previous years.

    Strategy
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Hedge funds follow dynamic trading strategies that are different from buy-and-hold strategies:
  </p>
  <h2>
   •
   <b>
    Global macro
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Follow a "top-down" approach to analyze the world economy and financial markets, and invest in corresponding stock, bond, and currency markets. George Soros' Quantum Fund is a typical global macro fund.
  </p>
  <h2>
   •
   <b>
    Convertible arbitrage
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Purchase the convertible securities and simultaneously short sell the same issuer's common stock.
  </p>
  <h2>
   •
   <b>
    Merger arbitrage/risk arbitrage
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Short sell the acquirer's stock and buy the target's stock to make arbitrage profit.
  </p>
  <h2>
   •
   <b>
    Fixed income arbitrage
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Purchase undervalued fixed income securities and short sell overvalued fixed income securities.
  </p>
  <h2>
   •
   <b>
    Long/short equity
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Combine long and short positions in equity securities. It could be long biased, short biased, or equity market neutral.
  </p>
  <h2>
   •
   <b>
    Event driven
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Aim to profit from some special events like merger and acquisition, reorganizations, or distressed companies.
  </p>
  <h2>
   •
   <b>
    Equity market neutral
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Take long and short position in equities with the goal of having no net exposure to equity markets.
  </p>
  <h2>
   •
   <b>
    Multistrategy
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A single hedge fund that is managed by multiple managers each following a separate strategy.
  </p>
  <h3>
   •
   <b>
    Fund of hedge funds
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Invest in a basket of underlying hedge fund managers for the purpose of diversification and operational due diligence. Investors in a fund of hedge funds pay two layers of fees: one at the underlying hedge fund level and one at the fund of hedge funds level.
  </p>
  <h1>
   <b>
    Minimum Investment
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Since hedge funds are designed for accredited/qualified investors, the minimum initial investment can be very high. For example, Eton Park Capital Management LLC has an initial investment of $5 million.c
  </p>
  <h1>
   <b>
    Lockup Period
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   It is a time period during which an investor's money cannot be redeemed. An advance notice period is typically accompanied by the lockup period for redemption. Hedge funds usually impose a shorter lockup period of less than two years, which is typically the minimum lockup period for private equity funds.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <b>
    Leverage
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In addition to investors' own money, a hedge fund can borrow additional money from prime brokers or other institutions for investment. This can increase both the return and risk. The exact amount of leverage used depends on the investment strategy. For example, at the end of 1997, Long Term Capital Management had a leverage ratio of 28 to 1 for its fixed income arbitrage fund.d
  </p>
  <h2>
   <b>
    US Regulation
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Unlike heavily regulated vehicles like mutual funds, hedge funds are largely exempt from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation (at the time of writing). Hedge funds issue securities in "private offerings" and are not required to be registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933. Furthermore, hedge funds are not required to make periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Like mutual funds and other securities market participants, hedge funds are subject to prohibitions against fraud, and their managers have the same fiduciary duties as other investment advisers. Depending upon their activities, in addition to complying with the federal securities laws, hedge funds and their advisers may have to comply with other laws including the Commodity Exchange Act or register with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

   <i>
    Performance Measures
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Unlike traditional investment vehicles, hedge funds are not required to report their performance to any database or regulatory organization. This leads to the question of the accuracy of the reported figures and whether the resulting selection bias prevents investors from having a complete picture of hedge fund industry. To date, three databases have been collecting data for longer than 10 years. They are CISDM (Center for International Securities and Derivatives Markets, University of Massachusetts, Amherst), HFR (Hedge Fund Research), and Lipper-TASS.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Return Distribution
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Table 1 presents certain statistical properties of the CISDM indices. First, hedge fund indices provide mean returns that are similar to those provided by traditional stock and bond indices but at lower volatility. Second, hedge fund indices tend to display large negative skewness and large positive excess kurtosis. These two indicate that hedge fund indices are likely to experience extreme negative returns. Hence, traditional measures such as standard deviation and Sharpe ratio may not be suitable for hedge funds. Alternative measures such as the downside deviation, VaR, expected short fall, and maximum drawdown have been proposed [30]. Finally, certain strategies display significant positive autocorrelation, which may indicate that hedge funds representing these strategies carry illiquid and infrequently traded securities.

   <b>
    Selection bias
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Bias resulting from managers reporting their returns on a voluntary basis. This bias arises if the hedge funds that report to databases are systematically different from the universe. The size of this bias is not known since the hedge fund universe is not reported. It is argued that better performing funds may be closed to new investors and therefore do not need to report to public databases. This indicates that reported returns underestimate the true returns. On the other hand, poor performing hedge funds may decide not to report to any database. In this case, the reported returns may overestimate returns to the hedge fund universe.
  </p>
  <h2>
   •
   <b>
    Survivorship bias
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Databases drop hedge funds that do not survive (i.e., stop reporting). Those that survive tend to have better performance.e The bias can be measured as the average return of the survived funds in excess of the average return of all funds. It must be noted that not all hedge funds that stop reporting to a database are doing so because of poor performance.f Some databases maintain records of those funds who decided to stop reporting to them. Using these databases, survivorship bias is estimated to be around 0.16–3.4% per year [1, 11, 16, 17, 29].
  </p>
  <h3>
   •
   <b>
    Backfill bias
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   When a manager decides to report his or her performance to a database, typically after obtaining a reasonable track record, the entire history of the manager may be added to the database (i.e., returns are backfilled). These backfilled returns are estimated to be about 1.3% per year higher than the returns
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   reported to the database after the manager is added to the database [8, 14, 16, 17].
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Liquidity Risk
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   This refers to risk originating from restrictions on money withdrawal or illiquid assets. It can be estimated by examining share restriction parameters such as lockup as well as return autocorrelations. Returns on certain hedge fund strategies tend to display significant autocorrelation. This estimated autocorrelation may be caused by the presence of illiquid assets in hedge fund portfolios or could be due to return smoothing performed by managers in order to reduce their estimated risk [7, 9, 22]. Estimates of volatility and other risk measures should be adjusted to account for the presence of autocorrelation in reported returns.g
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Operational Risk
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   It is estimated that one of the main reasons for hedge fund failures is operational risk. Owing to their private nature, hedge funds have low degree of transparency, which may further contribute to operational risk. A recent study by Brown
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [12] proposed to use the public filing information to build a numerical measure for operational risk. A further study shows that operational due diligence is an important source of fund of hedge funds alpha [10].

   regardless of market conditions. Several recent studies have examined factor exposures of hedge funds with the goal of determining whether hedge funds are able to earn positive risk-adjusted excess returns (or alpha). The biases discussed above generally do not have significant impact on the estimates of factor exposures of hedge funds. Rather, they are likely to affect the estimates of alphas.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Using linear multifactor models, available research shows that, depending on strategy, hedge funds have exposures to both equity and fixed income factors.h Though earlier studies reported significant exposures to these risk factors, the resulting Rsquares were relatively small. Lack of explanatory power of traditional risk factors can be due to several reasons. First, most hedge fund returns are reported on monthly basis, while hedge fund managers change their factor exposures more often. This will reduce the explanatory power of linear factor models and may create nonlinear exposures in monthly returns.i Second, the multifactor models may be missing certain factors that are traded by hedge fund managers leading to low explanatory power. Third, the optionlike incentive fee structure and investing in derivative securities can cause nonlinearity in risk exposures. Studies of factor exposures of hedge funds are generally conducted in order to determine if hedge funds offer positive excess risk-adjusted return. These studies generally show that top managers are able to generate risk-adjusted abnormal returns.j Fung

   Traditionally, hedge fund indices have been based on a particular database. For example, CISDM hedge fund indices represent equally weighted average performance of managers who report to CISDM. In general, most indices do not impose restrictions on the managers that are added to these databases.

   </sup>
   Also, most indices do not impose a minimum track record and new hedge funds are allowed to be included in strategy indices. Not all indices maintain a database of those managers who at one point reported to their database, but decided at some point in the past to stop reporting. CISDM, HFR, and Lipper-TASS databases have maintained such databases of "dead funds" in the past. Depending on when a database becomes public, it may contain a different degree of backfilled bias. Generally, databases created more recently tend to display a higher amount of backfilled bias.l Table 2 provides a summary of uninvestible indices.

    Investible indices

  <p block-type="Text">
   Since 2000, a number of manager-based hedge fund indices have been created that may be regarded as investible. Unlike their uninvestible counterparts, these investible indices impose several restrictions on hedge funds that are included in these indices. Foremost among these restrictions is that the managers must be open to new investments and must have adequate capacity. These managers then go through a rigorous due diligence process and at the end only a very small number of them are included in these indices.m Typically, there are between 6 and 12 managers in each strategy investible index. This may indicate that these indices are not representative of the hedge fund universe. Further, since performance figures of these investible indices are typically reported on a daily basis, financial institutions that offer these indices require these managers to carry more liquid positions when compared to other managers.
