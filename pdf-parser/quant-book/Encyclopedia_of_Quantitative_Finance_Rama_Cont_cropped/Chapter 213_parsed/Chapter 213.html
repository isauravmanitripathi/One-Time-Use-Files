    Equity–Credit Problem
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The equity–credit problem, perhaps the most significant problem of corporate finance, is the problem of linking the value of a firm's equity with that of its debt. Etymologically, the word "credit" is linked to credence, belief, faith, and confidence. As such it is passive and absolute; the only contingency that may affect it is default. One lends money to another on the faith that he/she will pay back the same. This introduces an asymmetry. The debtor may renege and the creditor will try to put his/her assets or company in bankruptcy. Equity, by contrast, is symmetric. Participating in somebody's equity is agreeing to share the profits, the losses, and the risks of the enterprise. Its only contingency is what action (not passion) the future has in stock for the shareholders. The word
   <i>
    equity
   </i>
   means "fairness" and the word for
   <i>
    share
   </i>
   , in French, is
   <i>
    action
   </i>
   .

   The pricing and hedging of convertible bonds (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Convertible Bonds
   </b>
   ) is an example of equity-to-credit problem: the optimal conversion policy intimately fuses the two. Once the hazard rate (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Hazard Rate
   </b>
   ) is made explicit alongside the price process of the underlying stock, it is followed by the question what kind of correlation can prevail between the two. Trying to model this correlation is the quantitative side of the equity-to-credit problem.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Derivative pricing models are almost never used normatively, going from theoretical parameter to derivative theoretical value. They are used in reverse, going from derivative
   <i>
    market
   </i>
   price to implied parameters (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Implied Volatility Surface
   </b>
   ). From this, it becomes apparent that a single volatility parameter cannot explain the variety of prices of options of different strikes and different maturities (the volatility smile), not mentioning that credit default swaps (CDSs,
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Credit Default Swaps
   </b>
   ) are also written on the company and traded. The equityto-credit problem, as it is understood today, is to find a unifying derivative pricing framework where the full volatility surface of equity options and the full term-structure of CDS spreads can be explained.

   Corporate events, which may have been lost under the impassive writing of derivative payoffs, thus reemerge as the script, waiting for our examination, that the prices of equity derivatives and the prices of credit derivatives now
   <i>
    jointly

   compose. The
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   volatility skew of out-of-the-money puts, the term structures of volatility and credit spread, all of which are commonly observed on single names, cannot be handled by Black–Scholes–Merton (BSM) or by any of the models that tried to improve on it simply by tweaking its assumptions (local volatility (
   <i>

   <b>
    Local Volatility Model
   </b>
   ), Heston stochastic volatility model (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Heston Model
   </b>
   ), etc.). These price structures are best (and most robustly) explained by a
   <i>
    regimeswitching model
   </i>
   (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Regime-switching Models
   </b>
   ). In this model, the volatility of the underlying share and the hazard rate can suddenly switch between different and very dissimilar regimes, accompanied by substantial jumps of the underlying equity price. Default itself is one such regime, except that it is a regime of a very extreme sort. Takeover and restructuring are other regimes. Poisson processes trigger the various switches, and the regime changes then lend themselves naturally to a reinterpretation in terms of
   <i>
    corporate events
   </i>
   [1]. The equity-to-credit problem, when it is reinterpreted in terms of derivative pricing, imprints back corporate events on market prices.

    A Regime-switching Model
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   There exist
   <i>
    K
   </i>
   volatility regimes, indexed from 1 to
   <i>
    K
   </i>
   , and one default regime, indexed by
   <i>
    d
   </i>
   . We assume that the regimes are observable and known at any time. By convention, regime 1 can be set as the present regime when we use the model, either to value contingent claims or to calibrate the model against their market prices. We let the discrete variable
   <i>
    ut
   </i>
   describe the current regime at time
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   . The dynamics of the regime is driven by a continuous time Markov process with a finite number of states or regimes. The important correlation between the stock price and its volatility, as well as between the stock price and the hazard rate, is captured by a possible jump on the stock price as a regime switch occurs. Here, we chose to model jumps by a very simple fixed percentage size jump; it would be possible to generalize to a density of jumps.
