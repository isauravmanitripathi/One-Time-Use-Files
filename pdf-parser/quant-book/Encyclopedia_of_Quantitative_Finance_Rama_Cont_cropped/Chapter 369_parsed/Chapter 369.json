In practice, models like (1) above are not fully satisfactory because they do not account for the—obvious and ubiquitous—fact that rounding-off occurs. Models like (2) with a fixed level <i>α</i> are not satisfactory either, on a mathematical level (they do not permit to retrieve the quantities of interest like <i>V</i> ) and on an empirical level they give rise to sequences of prices that stay constant for relatively many successive times and then oscillate wildly between two adjacent multiples of <i>α</i>, then stay constant again: this is not quite observed in practice; usually prices stay constant for a few successive times, with occasionally a jump back and forth of one unit. Probably a more reasonable model consists in a mixture of (1) and (2): we have additive errors <i>t</i> , and then rounding, that is, we observe <i>Zt</i> = <i>α(</i>[<i>(Xt</i> + <i>t)/α</i>]. It turns out—perhaps surprisingly—that if the errors <i>t</i> have a density that is positive on an arbitrarily located interval of length at least <i>α</i>, then it is possible to retrieve the integrated volatility <i>V</i> in pretty much the same way as when rounding</li>",
