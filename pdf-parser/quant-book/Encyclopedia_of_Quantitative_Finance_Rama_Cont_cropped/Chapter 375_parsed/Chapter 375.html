    Modigliani-Miller
   </b>
   Theorem
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The Modigliani-Miller theorem states that the value of a firm is invariant with respect to its leverage policy in an arbitrage-free market when there is no corporate income tax and no bankruptcy cost. Modigliani and Miller
   <math display="inline">
    (M-M)
   </math>
   [10] proved this "invariance" result using, for the first time, a "no-arbitrage" condition.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   To present the M-M theorem, we consider a simple levered firm in which there are two basic claimants on the firm's income:
  </p>
  <p block-type="ListGroup">
   <ul>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     debt holders, whose security allows them to claim the coupon
     <math display="inline">
      C
     </math>
     at each time
     <math display="inline">
      t
     </math>
     as long as default is not declared;
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     equity holders (the owners of the firm), whose security allows them, once debt holders have been paid, to claim the residual cash flow (if positive) as dividends.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Debt holders are paid
   <i>
    before
   </i>
   equity holders, but their claim does not allow them to receive more than the coupon, no matter what the net result is. On the contrary, dividends received by equity holders may be very high when the net result is very high but can also be very low (and even null) when the net result is very low. Equity holders are frequently called the residual claimant since they own the residual income (i.e., the net result) of the firm, that is, what remains when employees, debt holders, and government have been paid.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Let
   <math display="inline">
    E^l
   </math>
   and B be the market value of equity and debt, respectively, of a given firm at some point in time. To become the owner of this (levered) firm, an investor must buy not only the equity
   <math display="inline">
    E^l
   </math>
   but also the debt of the firm, so that the total payment is equal to
   <math display="inline">
    V^l = E^l + B
   </math>
   , where
   <math display="inline">
    V^l
   </math>
   is called the
   <i>
    value of the
   </i>
   firm. It is thus tempting to think that if we increase B, the value of the firm
   <math display="inline">
    V^l
   </math>
   will also increase. Finding the conditions under which debt affects the value of the firm is the central question of
   <math display="inline">
    M-M
   </math>
   analysis: given a
   <i>
    fixed
   </i>
   investment policy, what are the condition(s) under which debt does not affect the value of the firm?

   <b>
    Basic Statement of the Theorem
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Consider a firm that has invested in some productive asset, which allows it to generate an operating income (i.e., the earning before interests and taxes
   <math display="inline">
    (EBIT)
   </math>
   )
   <math display="inline">
    X_t
   </math>
   at each time t. Roughly speaking,
   <math display="inline">
    X_t
   </math>
   is equal to the value of the sales minus production costs. When positive,
   <math display="inline">
    X_t
   </math>
   is used to pay debt holders (coupon), government (tax), and equity holders (dividends).
  </p>
  <h2>
   Unlevered Firm
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In this case, the value of the firm at time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   is denoted by
   <math display="inline">
    v_t
   </math>
   , and is simply equal to the net result, that is,

  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">

   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    T_a
   </math>
   is the corporate tax income.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Let
   <math display="inline">
    C
   </math>
   be the coupon of the corporate debt and
   <math display="inline">
    T

   be the maturity of the debt. In what follows, we not only consider the case of a
   <i>
    perpetual debt
   </i>
   so that
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   is infinite but we also assume that each firm distributes all the residual income (or cash flow) as dividends to equity holders. This thus implies that the firm does not have any cash reserve that it can use when the EBIT is not enough to pay the coupon C. Let
   <math display="inline">
    v^l

   be the value of the levered firm at a given time

   <b>
    Classical Presentation
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In their original work, Modigliani and Miller [10] make the following assumptions.&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;
  </p>
  <p block-type="ListGroup">
   <ul>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     Capital markets are perfectly competitive. 1.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     2. Individuals and firms can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate
     <math display="inline">
      r
     </math>
     .
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     3. All firms are assumed to be in the same class risk.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Assumption 1 implies that market investors have full (and symmetric) information concerning the return of the firm, that there are no transaction costs, and that there are no restriction on asset trade, that is, long and short positions are possible. Assumption 2 means that when firms or households borrow, they are not subject to default risk so that they can borrow at the risk-free rate. Assumption 3 means that the stream of EBIT is the same for all firms in the same class risk; if two firms, one levered and one unlevered, belong to the same class risk, then, they differ only with respect to leverage.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   In their original work, Modigliani and Miller [10] consider a discrete-time model in which the family of random variable
   <math display="inline">
    \{X_t\}_{t\geq 1}
   </math>
   is identically and independently distributed. Let
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{E}(X_t) = \bar{X}
   </math>
   be the expectation of
   <math display="inline">
    X_t
   </math>
   under the probability measure
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{P}
   </math>
   . In the present framework, the corporate debt is riskless if
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{P}(X_t &gt; C) = 1
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <h4>
   Cost of Capital and Valuation Principle
  </h4>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   In
   <math display="inline">
    M-M
   </math>
   [10], the valuation principle is fairly simple: the present value of a stream of risky cash flow is equal to the
   <i>
    expected
   </i>
   sum over time of the
   <i>
    discounted
   </i>
   value of the cash flow. The expectation is taken under the probability measure
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{P}
   </math>
   , and the discount factor, also called risk adjusted rate of return or, more simply, the cost of capital incorporates a risk premium. Since, in general, investors are risk averse, the riskier the cash flow, the higher is the cost of capital. Let
   <math display="inline">
    r
   </math>
   be the cost of capital of a riskless cash flow and
   <math display="inline">
    k_u &gt; r
   </math>
   be the cost of capital of a risky cash flow.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Using the above principle, the value of the unlevered firm is equal to the present value of the flow of
   <math display="inline">
    v_t
   </math>
   , that is,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    V = E = \mathbb{E} \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{v_t}{(1 + k_u)^t} = \frac{\bar{X}(1 - T_a)}{k_u} \quad (7)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    V
   </math>
   denotes the value of the unlevered firm, which is also equal to the value of equity
   <math display="inline">
    E
   </math>
   . To determine the value of the levered firm now, we have to compute the expected discounted value of the flow of
   <math display="inline">
    v_t^l
   </math>
   . Using equation (3), we just have to compute the value of the stream of tax shield. By assumption, the corporate debt is a perpetual risk-free one, so that the relevant cost of capital for the tax shield is
   <math display="inline">
    r
   </math>
   . It thus follows that
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    V^{l} = \mathbb{E} \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{X_{t}(1 - T_{a})}{(1 + k_{u})^{t}} + \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{T_{a} C}{(1 + r)^{t}}
   </math>
   <math display="block">
    = V + T_{a} \frac{C}{r} = V + T_{a} B \tag{8}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    B = \frac{C}{a}
   </math>
   is the value of the perpetual corporate risk-free debt, and
   <math display="inline">
    T_a B
   </math>
   the value of the perpetual tax shield. The value of the levered firm is thus equal to the value of the unlevered firm plus the value of the tax shield. We can now state the famous invariance result when
   <math display="inline">
    T_a = 0
   </math>
   . Let
   <math display="inline">
    \frac{B}{E^l}
   </math>
   be the
   <i>
    debtâ€“equity ratio
   </i>
   where
   <math display="inline">
    E^l = V^l - B
   </math>
   is the value of equity of the levered firm.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Modiglianiâ€“Miller Theorem with Risk-free Debt
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In addition to the above assumptions, suppose that there is no arbitrage opportunity and no corporate income tax (i.e.,
   <math display="inline">
    T_a = 0
   </math>
   ); then,
   <math display="inline">
    V = V^l
   </math>
   , that is, the value of the firm is invariant with respect to the debt-equity ratio.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   This result implies that when there are no taxes and no default risk, the value of the firm is
   <i>
    invariant
   </i>
   with respect to the "financing policy", which means that issuing only equity or issuing a mix of debt and equity does not affect the value of the firm. Fundamentally, the value of the firm is determined by the stream of EBIT, that is, by the investment policy; debt affects only the
   <i>
    split
   </i>
   of the value of the firm between debt holders and equity holders. As a consequence, different debt-equity ratios lead to different splits of the total value but have no impact on this total value.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   From a mathematical point of view, the proof is trivial, since when
   <math display="inline">
    T_a = 0
   </math>
   , we immediately get that
   <math display="inline">
    V = V^l
   </math>
   . Actually, Modigliani and Miller became very famous not only for the result
   <i>
    per se
   </i>
   , but also because they offered, for the first time, a no-arbitrage
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   <math display="inline">
    principle
    <sup>
     e
    </sup>
   </math>
   for security valuation: they showed that if
   <math display="inline">
    V^l &gt; V
   </math>
   when
   <math display="inline">
    T_a = 0
   </math>
   , then, there is an arbitrage opportunity.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   While the proof is rather simple, it highlights their assumptions. Consider two firms that are in the same class risk. The first is unlevered while the second is levered. Since
   <math display="inline">
    T_a = 0
   </math>
   , the value of equity of the levered firm is equal to
   <math display="inline">
    E^l = V - C/r
   </math>
   while the value of equity of the unlevered firm is
   <math display="inline">
    V = E
   </math>
   . Consider now an equity holder who owns
   <math display="inline">
    \kappa\%
   </math>
   of the shares of the levered firm. At each time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   , his/her claim
   <math display="inline">
    D_t
   </math>
   (i.e., dividend) is equal to
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    D_t = \kappa (X_t - C) \tag{9}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Suppose now that he/she sells his/her part of the levered firm for an amount
   <math display="inline">
    \kappa E^l
   </math>
   and borrows an amount equal to
   <math display="inline">
    \kappa(C/r)
   </math>
   . With that money, he/she buys a fraction
   <math display="inline">
    \frac{\kappa(\dot{E}^l + (C/r))}{V}
   </math>
   of the shares of the unlevered firm. Actually, the equity holder borrows an amount
   <math display="inline">
    \kappa C/r
   </math>
   to
   <i>
    replicate
   </i>
   the leverage of the firm, and this has been called a
   <i>
    homemade leverage
   </i>
   . Note importantly that by assumption 2, the investor borrows at the risk-free rate. He/she thus holds a portfolio in which he/she will not only perceive the dividends (in proportion of his/her part) of the unlevered firm at each time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   but will also have to pay the interest expense equal to
   <math display="inline">
    \kappa C
   </math>
   . The return of his/her portfolio is thus equal to
   <math display="inline">
    Y_t = \frac{\kappa (E^l + C/r)}{V} X_t - \kappa C
   </math>
   . By definition,
   <math display="inline">
    V^{l} = E^{l} + B
   </math>
   so that
   <math display="inline">
    Y_{t}
   </math>
   is equal at each time
   <math display="inline">
    t

   to

  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    Y_t = \kappa \left(\frac{V^l}{V} X_t - C\right) \qquad t \ge 1 \tag{10}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Since
   <math display="inline">
    V^l &gt; V
   </math>
   by assumption, it thus follows that
   <math display="inline">
    Y_t &gt; D_t
   </math>
   with probability one, which is an arbitrage opportunity. If we rule out such an arbitrage opportunity, then,
   <math display="inline">
    V^l = V

   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As Duffie [2] remarks in his review on
   <math display="inline">
    M-M
   </math>
   theorem, the result follows because equity holders can undertake the same financial transaction as the firm in exactly the same condition. If an equity holder is considered as defaultable so that he/she must borrow at a rate higher than the risk-free rate, then, he/she cannot offset the financial decision of the firm at the same price.

   Contrast with Empirical Evidence
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In contrast to the
   <math display="inline">
    M-M
   </math>
   theorem, the value of firms is actually influenced by their capital structure: the debt-equity ratio affects the value of the firm. To explain the observed debt-equity ratio, a large part of the recent theory of capital structure has been to explore the role of the conflicts, inexistent in the
   <math display="inline">
    M-M
   </math>
   analysis, that arise among managers, equity holders, and debt holders. Informational asymmetries play an important role. The article of Harris and Raviv [5] and the books of Milgrom [9] or Hillier
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [7] contain a very readable presentation of many aspects of the recent theory of capital structure.

   <math display="inline">
    V_t

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Consider now the value of the bankruptcy costs. Seen from

   , their value is
   <math display="inline">
