    Arbitrage Pricing Theory
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The arbitrage pricing theory (APT) was introduced by Ross [10] as an alternative to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The model derives a multibeta representation
   <math display="inline">
    of
   </math>
   expected returns relative to a set of
   <math display="inline">
    K
   </math>
   reference variables under assumptions that may be described roughly as follows:
  </p>
  <p block-type="ListGroup">
   <ul>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     1. There exists no mean-variance arbitrage.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     The asset returns follow a
     <math display="inline">
      K
     </math>
     -factor model. 2.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     The reference variables and the factors are non-3. trivially correlated.&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The first assumption implies that there are no portfolios with arbitrarily large expected returns and unit variance. The second one assumes that the returns are a function of
   <math display="inline">
    K
   </math>
   factors common to all assets, and noise term specific to each asset. The third one identifies the sets of reference variables for which the model works.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The model predictions may have approximation errors. However, these errors are small for each portfolio that its weight on each asset is small (a welldiversified portfolio).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Early versions of the model unnecessarily assumed that the factors are equal to the reference variables. The extension of the model to arbitrary sets of reference variables comes at the cost of increasing the bound on the approximation errors by a multiplicative factor. However, when focusing on pricing of only well-diversified portfolios, this seems to be unimportant because each of the approximation error is small and a multiplicative factor does not change much the size of the error.
