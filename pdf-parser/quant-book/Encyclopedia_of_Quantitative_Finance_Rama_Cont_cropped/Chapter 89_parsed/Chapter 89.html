    American Options

  </h1>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   An American option is a contract between the seller and the buyer. It is characterized by a nonnegative random function of time
   <math display="inline">
    Z
   </math>
   and a maturity. The option can be exercised at any time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   between the initial date and the maturity. If the buyer exercises the option at time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   , he/she receives the amount of money
   <math display="inline">
    Z(t)
   </math>
   at time t. The buyer may exercise the option only once before the maturity. The price of an American option is always greater than or equal to the price of the corresponding European option (see
   <b>
    Blackâ€“Scholes Formula
   </b>
   ). Indeed, the buyer of an American option gets more rights than the one who holds a European option, as he/she may exercise the option at any time before the maturity. This is the right of early exercise, and the difference between the American and European options prices is called the early exercise premium. The basic American options are American call and put options (see Call Options): they allow the buyer to sell or buy a financial asset at a price
   <math display="inline">
    K
   </math>
   (the strike price) and before a date (maturity) agreed before. The function
   <math display="inline">
    Z
   </math>
   associated to the call (respectively put) option is then
   <math display="inline">
    Z(t) = (S_t - K)^+
   </math>
   (respectively
   <math display="inline">
    Z(t) = (K - S_t)^{+}
   </math>
   , where
   <math display="inline">
    S_t
   </math>
   is the value at time t of the underlying financial asset.

   The study of American options began in 1965 with McKean [41] who considered the pricing problem as an optimal stopping problem and reduced it to a free boundary problem. The option value is then computable if one knows the free boundary called the optimal exercise boundary. In 1976, Van Moerbecke [48] exhibited some properties of this boundary. The formalization of the American option pricing problem as an optimal stopping problem was done in the two pioneering works of Benssoussan and Karatzas [5, 32].

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   They have proved that, under no arbitrage and completeness assumptions (see Complete Markets), the value process of an American option is the Snell envelope of the pay-off process, that is, the smallest supermartingale greater than the pay-off process. From previous works on these processes [23], we can derive some properties of the value process. Especially, we obtain characterization of optimal exercise times. In the section American Option and Snell Envelope, we present the main results and some
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   numerical methods based on this characterization of the option value process.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We can adopt a complementary point of view to study an American option. If we specify the evolution model for the underlying assets of the option, we could characterize the option value as the solution of a variational inequality. This method, introduced by Benssoussan and Lions [6], was applied to American options by Jaillet
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [31]. We present this variational approach in the section Analytic Properties of American Options. We conclude this survey by giving results on exercise regions. In particular, we recall a formula linking the European and the American option prices known as the early exercise premium formula (see the section Exercise Region).

   To price and hedge an American option, we have to choose a model for the financial market. We consider a filtered probability space
   <math display="inline">
    (\Omega, \mathbb{F} = (\mathcal{F}_t)_{0 \le t \le T}, \mathbb{P}),
   </math>
   where T is the maturity of our investment,

    \mathcal{F}_t

   the information available at time t, and
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{P}

   <math display="inline">
    d + 1
   </math>
   assets:
   <math display="inline">

   <math display="inline">

   <math display="inline">

   . In this section, we assume that the market does not offer arbitrage opportunities and is complete (see Complete Markets). Harisson and Pliska [28] observed that the no arbitrage assumption is equivalent to the existence of a probability measure equivalent to the historical one under which the discounted asset price processes are martingales. In a complete market, such a probability measure is unique and called the risk-neutral probability measure (see Risk-neutral Pricing). We will denote it by

  <h1>
   American Option Pricing
  </h1>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   We present the problems linked to the American option study. The first one is the option pricing. An American option is characterized by an adapted and nonnegative process
   <math display="inline">
    (Z_t)_{t&gt;0}
   </math>
   , which represents the option pay-off if its owner exercises it at time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   . We generally define
   <math display="inline">
    Z
   </math>
   as a function of one or several underlying assets. For instance, for a call option with strike price K, we have
   <math display="inline">
    Z_t = (S_t - K)^+
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   or for a put option on the minimum of two assets, we have
   <math display="inline">
    Z_t = (K - \min(S_t^1, S_t^2))^+
   </math>
   . There also exist options, called
   <i>
    Amerasian options
   </i>
   , where the pay-off depends on the whole path of the assets, for instance,
   <math display="inline">
    Z_t = \left(K - \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t S_u \, \mathrm{d}u\right)^\top.
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Using arbitrage arguments, Benssoussan and Karatzas [5, 32] have shown that the discounted American option value at time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   is the Snell envelope of the discounted pay-off process [19, 43]. For the definition and general properties on the Snell envelope, we refer to [23] for continuous time and to [44] for discrete time. We can then assert that the price at time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   of an American option with pay-off process
   <math display="inline">
    Z
   </math>
   and maturity
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   is
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    P_{t} = \text{esssup}_{\tau \in \mathcal{T}_{t,T}} \mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}^{*}} \left[ \frac{S_{t}^{0}}{S_{\tau}^{0}} Z_{\tau} \mid \mathcal{F}_{t} \right] \tag{1}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    \mathcal{T}_{t,T}

   <math display="inline">
    [t, T]

   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The second problem appearing in the option theory consists in determining a hedging strategy for the option seller (see
   <b>
    Hedging
   </b>
   ). The solution follows directly from the Snell envelope properties. Indeed, if
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   is a process, we will denote the discounted process by
   <math display="inline">
    \tilde{X} = \frac{X}{\varsigma_0}
   </math>
   and we have the following result ([35, Corollary 10.2.4]).
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   <b>
    Proposition 1
   </b>
   The process
   <math display="inline">
    (\tilde{P}_t)_{0 \le t \le T}
   </math>
   is the smallest right-continuous super martingale that dominates
   <math display="inline">
    (Z_t)_{0 \le t \le T}.
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   As
   <math display="inline">
    (\tilde{P}_t)_{0 \le t \le T}
   </math>
   is a super martingale, it admits a Doob decomposition (see Doob-Meyer Decom
   <b>
    position
   </b>
   ). There exist a unique right-continuous martingale
   <math display="inline">
    (M_t)_{0 \le t \le T}
   </math>
   and a unique nondecreasing, continuous, adapted process
   <math display="inline">
    (A_t)_{0 \le t \le T}
   </math>
   such that
   <math display="inline">
    A_0 = 0
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    \tilde{P}_t = M_t - A_t
   </math>
   for all
   <math display="inline">
    t \in [0, T]
   </math>
   . This decomposition of
   <math display="inline">
    P
   </math>
   is very useful to determine a surreplication strategy for an American option (see
   <b>
    Superhedging
   </b>
   ). A strategy is defined as a predictable process
   <math display="inline">
    (\phi_t)_{0 \le t \le T}
   </math>
   such that the value, at time
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   , of the portfolio associated with this strategy is
   <math display="inline">
    V_t(\phi) =
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    \sum_{i=0}^{d} \phi_t^i S_t^i
   </math>
   . In a complete market, each contingent claim is replicable; then there exists a self-financing strategy
   <math display="inline">
    \phi
   </math>
   such that
   <math display="inline">
    V_T(\phi) = S_T^0 M_T
   </math>
   . As
   <math display="inline">
    \tilde{V}(\phi)
   </math>
   is a martingale under the risk-neutral probability, we get
   <math display="inline">
    \tilde{V}_t(\phi) = M_t
   </math>
   for all
   <math display="inline">
    t \in [0, T]
   </math>
   . In conclusion, we have constructed a self-financing strategy such that
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \forall t \in [0, T], \quad V_t(\phi) = P_t + S_t^0 A_t \ge P_t \quad (2)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   This is a surreplication strategy for American options. Moreover, for this strategy, the initial wealth for hedging the option is minimum because we have
   <math display="inline">
    V_0(\phi) = P_0.
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The third problem arising in the American option theory is linked to early exercise opportunity. Contrary to European options, for the American option holder, knowing the arbitrage price of his/her option is not enough. He/she has to know when it is optimal for him/her to exercise the option. The tool to study this problem is the optimal stopping theory.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Optimal Exercise
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We recall some useful results of the optimal stopping theory and apply them to the American put option in the famous Black-Scholes model. These results are proved in [23] in a larger setting and their financial applications have been developed in [35]. An optimal stopping time for an American option holder is a stopping time that maximizes his/her gain. Consequently, a stopping time
   <math display="inline">
    \nu
   </math>
   is optimal if we have
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}^*}[\tilde{Z}_{\nu}] = \text{esssup}_{\tau \in \mathcal{T}_0 \, \tau} \mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}^*}[\tilde{Z}_{\tau} \mid \mathcal{F}_t] \tag{3}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We have a characterization of optimal stopping times, thanks to the following theorem.

   , the function

These results are still true in the local volatility model introduced in the section Analytic Properties of American Options. Hence, for a put option with maturity

   Using the integral equation satisfied by

    \lim_{t\to T} s(t) = \min(K, \frac{rK}{s})

   The description of exercise region for options on several assets is more interesting because in high dimension numerical methods are less efficient and it helps to have a better understanding of these products. Broadie and Detemple were the first to investigate this problem [10]. They give precise descriptions of the exercise region shapes for the most traded options on several assets. Their results were completed by Villeneuve [49]. In particular, he gives a characterization of the nonemptiness of the exercise region. We just quote here the main results concerning a call option on the maximum on two

   Early Exercise Premium Formula

   About the same time, many authors have exhibited a decomposition formula for the American option price
   <math display="inline">
    [14, 30, 43]

   . This formula is very enlightening from a financial point of view because it consists in writing that

    P_t = P_t^e + a_t

   is a nonnegative function of time corresponding to the premium the option buyer has to pay to get the right of early exercise. If the exercise region is known, a closed formula allows us to compute this premium. We recall this formula for a put option on a dividend-paying asset following the Black-Scholes model:

  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    P(t,x) = P^{e}(t,x) + \int_{t}^{T} \mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}^{*}}[e^{-r(u-t)}(\delta S_{u} - rK) \times \zeta_{\{S_{u} \geq s(u)\}} | S_{t} = x] du

   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}^*}[e^{-r(T-t)}(K-S_T)^+|S_t=x]

   . This formula is equally interesting from a theoretical point of view as it leads to an integral equation for the critical price:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    K - s(t) = P^{e}(t, s(t)) + \int_{t}^{T} \mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}^{*}}[\mathrm{e}^{-ru} \left(\delta S_{u} - rK\right)

   We can also use this formula and the integral equation satisfied by the free boundary to study the behavior of the exercise region for short maturity. This is a crucial point for numerical methods. Indeed, we have seen that both the value function and the free boundary present irregularities near maturity, which implies instability in numerical methods.

  <h2>
   Behavior Near Maturity
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The behavior of the exercise region near maturity has been extensively studied when there is only one underlying asset. In his pioneering work, Van Moerbecke conjectured a parabolic behavior for the boundary near maturity [48]. However, when the asset does not distribute dividends, it has been shown that there is an extra logarithmic factor [4]. Lamberton and Villeneuve have then proved that, in the Black-Scholes model, the free boundary has a parabolic behavior if its limit is a point of regularity for the pay-off function, else a logarithmic factor appears [39]. This result has been extended to local volatility model in [17]. In a recent paper [16], new approximations are provided for the location of the free boundary by using integral equation satisfied by
   <math display="inline">
    P
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    s
   </math>
   . However, this technique cannot be extended to the case of options on several assets. When there are several underlying assets, the behavior of the exercise boundary near maturity has been studied by NystrÃ¶m [45], who has proved that the convergence rate, when time to maturity goes to
   <math display="inline">
    0
   </math>
   , is faster than parabolic.
