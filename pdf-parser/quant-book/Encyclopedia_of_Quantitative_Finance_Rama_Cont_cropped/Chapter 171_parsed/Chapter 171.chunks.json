Increasingly, midsize and smaller organizations are appreciating the benefits of credit scoring as well. The credit score is reflected in a number or letter(s) that summarizes the overall risk utilizing available information on the customer. Credit scoring models predict the probability that an applicant or existing borrower will default or become delinquent over a fixed time horizon.c The credit score empowers users to make quick decisions or even to automate decisions, and this is extremely desirable when banks are dealing with large volumes of clients and relatively small margin of profits at individual transaction level.</p>",

However, in most of these studies, authors pointed out that two basic assumptions of MDA are often violated when applied to the default prediction problems.e Moreover, in MDA models, the standardized coefficients cannot be interpreted such as the slopes of a regression equation and, hence, do not indicate the relative importance of the different variables. Considering these MDA's problems, Ohlson [26], for the first time, applied the conditional logit model to the default prediction's study.f The practical benefits of the logit methodology are that it does not require the restrictive assumptions of MDA and allows working with disproportional samples. The performance of his models, in terms of classification accuracy, was lower than the one reported in the previous studies based on MDA, but he pointed out some reasons to prefer the logistic analysis.</p>",
