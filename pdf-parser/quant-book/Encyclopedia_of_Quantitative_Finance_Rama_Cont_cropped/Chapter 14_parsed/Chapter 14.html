  <p block-type="Text">
   Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) launched its flagship fund on February 24, 1994, with $1.125 billion in capital, making it the largest start-up hedge fund to date. Over $100 million came from the partners themselves, especially those who came from the proprietary trading operation that John Meriwether had headed at Salomon Brothers. At Salomon, the profit generated by this group had regularly exceeded the profit generated by the entire firm, and the idea of LTCM was to continue this record on their own. To help them, they also recruited a dream team of academic talent, most notably Myron Scholes and Robert Merton (

   ), who would win the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics for their pioneering work in financial economics. But they were not alone; half of the founding partners taught finance at major business schools.

   The first few years of the fund continued the success of the Salomon years (Table 1).

  <p block-type="Text">
   The fund was closed to new capital in 1995 and quickly grew to $7.5 billion of capital by the end of 1997. At this time the partners decided, given the lack of additional opportunities, to pay a dividend of $2.7 billion, which left the capital at the beginning of 1998 at $4.8 billion.

   so LTCM would lever the spread trade to raise the overall risk level, as well as the expected return on invested capital.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An example of such a trade is an on-the-run
   <i>
    versus
   </i>
   off-the-run trade. In August 1998, 30-year treasuries (the on-the-run bond) had a yield to maturity of 5.50%. The 29-year bond (the off-the-run issue) was 12 basis points (bp) cheaper, with a yield to maturity of 5.62%. The outright risk of 30-year treasury bonds was a standard deviation of around 85 bp per year. The spread trade only had a risk level of around 3.5 bp per year, so the spread trade could be levered 25 to 30 to 1, bringing it in line with the market risk of 30-year treasuries.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   LTCM would never do a trade that mathematically looked attractive according to its models unless they qualitatively understood why the trade worked and what were the forces that would bring the "spreads" to convergence. In the case of the on-therun versus off-the-run trade, the main force leading to a difference in yields between the two bonds is liquidity. The 30-year bond is priced higher by 12 bp (approximately 1.2 points on a par bond) because some investors are willing to pay more to own a more liquid bond. But in six months' time, when the treasury issues a new 30-year bond, that new bond will be the most liquid one and the old 30-year bond will lose its liquidity premium. This means that in six months' time, it will trade at a yield similar to that of the old 29-year bond, thus bringing about a convergence of the spread.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   LTCM was involved in many such relative-value trades, in many different and seemingly unrelated markets and instruments. These included trades in Government bond spreads, swap spreads, yield curve arbitrage, mortgage arbitrage, volatility spreads, risk arbitrage, and equity relative value trades. In each case, the bet was that some spread would converge over time.
  </p>
  <h1>

  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   LTCM knew that a major risk to pursuing relativevalue convergence trades was the ability to hold the trades until they converged. To ensure this, LTCM insisted that investors lock in equity capital for 3 years, so there would be no premature liquidation from investor cashout. This equity lock-in also gave counterparties comfort that LTCM had long-lasting
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   credit worthiness, and that enabled LTCM to acquire preferential financing.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As a further protection, LTCM also made extensive use of term financing. If the on-the-run/off-therun trade might take six months to converge, LTCM would finance the securities for six months, instead of rolling the financing overnight. LTCM also had a two-way mark-to-market provisions in all of its over-the-counter contracts. Thus for its relative value trades that consisted of both securities and contractual agreements it had fully symmetric marks, so that the only time LTCM had to put additional equity capital into a trade was if the spreads widened out. The fund also had term debt and backstop credit lines in place as alternative funding.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   LTCM also stress tested its portfolio relative to potential economic shocks to the system, and hedged against the consequences. As an example, in 1995, LTCM had a large swapped position in Italian government bonds. The firm got very worried that if the Republic of Italy defaulted, it would have a sizable loss. So it purchased insurance against this potential default by doing a credit default swap on the Italian government bonds.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   But the primary source of risk management relied on the benefit that the portfolio obtained due to
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   diversification. If the relative value strategies had very low correlations with each other, then the risk of the overall portfolio would be low. LTCM assumed that in the long run these correlations were low because of the loose economic ties between the trades, although in the short run these correlations could be significantly higher. LTCM also assumed that the downside risk on some of the trades was diminished, as spreads got very wide, on the assumption that other leveraged funds would rush in to take advantage. In retrospect, these assumptions were all falsified by experience.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Before the crisis, LTCM had a historical risk level of a $45 million daily standard deviation of return on the fund. See Figure 1 for historical daily returns.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   After the fund reached global scale in 1995, the risk level was remarkably stable. In fact, the partners had actually predicted a higher risk level for the fund as they assumed that the correlations among the relative value trades would be higher then historical levels. But in 1998, all this changed.

    The 1998 Crisis
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In 1998, LTCM was up slightly in the first four months of the year. Then, in May, the portfolio lost 6% and in June, it lost 10%. In early July, the portfolio rebounded by about 7% and the partners reduced the underlying risk of the portfolio accordingly by about 10%.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The crisis was triggered by the Russian default on its domestic bonds on August 17, 1998. While LTCM did not have many Russian positions so that its direct losses were small, the default did initiate the process that was to follow as unrelated markets all over the world reacted. On Friday August 21, LTCM had a one-day loss of $550 million. (A risk arb deal that was set to close on that day, that of Ciena and Tellabs, broke, causing a $160 million loss. Swap spreads that normally move about 1 bp a day were out 21 bp intraday.) The Russian debt crisis had triggered a flight out of all relative-value positions. In the illiquid days at the end of August, these liquidations caused a downward spiral as new losses led to more liquidations and more losses. The result was that by the end of August LTCM was down by 53% for the year, with the capital now at $2.3 billion.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   While the Russian default triggered the economic crisis in August, it was an LTCM crisis in September. Would the fund fail? Many other institutions with similar positions liquidated them in advance of the potential failure. Some market participants bet against the firm and counterparties marked contractual agreements at extremely wide levels to obtain additional cushions against bankruptcy. The partners hired Goldman Sachs to help them raise additional capital and to sell off assets; for this, they received 50% of the management company.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The leverage of the firm went to an enormous levels involuntarily (Figure 2), not because of increase in assets but because of equity falling. In the event, attempts to raise additional funds failed and on Monday, September 21, the fund lost another $550 million, putting its capital for the first time below $1 billion. On Wednesday, at the behest of the Federal Reserve, the 15 major counterparties met at the New York Fed to discuss the situation.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   During the meeting, at 11:00 AM the partners received a telephone call from Warren Buffett, who was on a satellite phone while vacationing with Bill Gates in Alaska. He said that LTCM was about to receive a bid on its entire portfolio from him and that he hoped they would seriously consider it. At 11:30 AM LTCM received the fax message given in Figure 3.

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The partners were unable to accept the proposal as it was crafted. The fund had approximately 15 000 distinct positions. Each of these positions was a credit counterparty transaction (i.e., a repo or swap
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   contract). Transfer of those positions to the Buffettled group would require the approval of all the counterparties. Clearly, all of LTCM's counterparties would prefer to have Warren Buffett as a creditor
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   as opposed to an about-to-be-bankrupt hedge fund. But it was going to be next to impossible to obtain complete approval in one hour.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The partners proposed, as an alternative, that the group make an emergency equity infusion into the fund in return for 90% ownership and the right to kick the partners out as managers. Under this plan, all the financing would stay in place and the third party investors could be redeemed at anytime. Unfortunately, the lawyers were not able to get Buffett back on his satellite phone and no one was prepared to consummate the deal without his approval.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   At the end of the day, 14 financial institutions (everyone with the exception of Bear Stearns) agreed to make an emergency $3.625 billion equity infusion into the fund. The plan was essentially a no-fault bankruptcy where the creditors of a company (in this case, the secured creditors) make an equity investment, cramming down the old equity holders, in order to liquidate the company in an orderly manner.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Why did the Fed orchestrate the bailout? The answer has to do with how the bankruptcy laws are applied with respect to financial firms. When LTCM did the on-the-run versus off-the-run strategy, the risk of the two sides of the trade netted within the fund. But in bankruptcy, each side of the trade liquidates its collateral separately, and sends a bill to LTCM. The risk involved in the position is thus no longer netted at 3.5 bp but is actually 85 bp per side. Although the netted risk of LTCM was $45 million per day, the gross risk was much larger, more like $30 million per day with each of 15 counterparties.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As conditions worsened, early in September, the partners had been going around to the counterparties and explaining this enormous potential risk factor in the event of bankruptcy and the large losses that the counterparties would potentially face. They separately asked each dealer to make an equity infusion to shore up LTCM's capital situation. But it was a classic Prisoner's Dilemma problem. No dealer would commit unless everyone else did. It was necessary to get everyone in the same room, so that they would all know the full extent of the exposures and all commit together, and that could not happen until bankruptcy was imminent.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   In this event, the private bailout was a success. No counterparty had any losses on their collateral. By the end of the first quarter of 1999, the fund had rallied 25% from its value at the time of the
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   bailout. At that time third-party investors were paid off. The consortium of banks decided to continue the liquidation at a faster pace and, by December 1999, the liquidation was complete. The banks had no losses and had made a 10% return on their investment.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Investors who had made a $1 investment at the beginning of 1998 would have seen their investment fall to 8 cents at the time of the bailout, and would have received 10 cents on April 1, 1999. But in its earlier years, LTCM had made high returns and paid out high dividends such that of its 100 investors only 12 actually lost money, and only 6 lost more than $2 million. The median investor actually had a 19% internal rate of return (IRR) even including the loss. The partners did not fare as well. Their capital was about $2 billion at the beginning of 1998 and they received no final payout.

   <b>
    Lessons Learned
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The LTCM crisis illustrates some of the pitfalls of a VaR-based risk management system (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Value-at-Risk
   </b>
   ), where the risk of the portfolio is determined by the exogenous economic relationships among the trades. During the crisis, all of LTCM's trades moved together with correlations approaching one, even though the trades were economically diverse. It was hard to believe that the returns from US mortgage arbitrage trades would be highly related to LTCM's Japanese warrant and convertible book or highly related to their European government bond spread trades. Yet, during the crisis these correlations all moved toward one, resulting in a failure of diversification and creating enormous risk for the fund.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   What was the common thread in all of these trades? It was not that they were economically related, but more that they had similar holders of the trades with common risk tolerances. When these hedge funds and proprietary trading groups at the banks lost money in the Russian crisis they were ordered by senior management to reduce their risk exposures. The trades that they took off were the relative-value trades. As they unwound their positions in the illiquid days of August, the spreads went out further, causing more losses and further unwinds.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   This risk might be better classified as endogenous risk, risk that comes about not from the fundamental
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   economic relationships of the cash flows of the securities but in a crisis through the common movements of the holders of the trades. Prudent risk management practices need to manage the portfolio risk not just for normal times but for crisis times, taking into account the endogenous aspect of risk.
