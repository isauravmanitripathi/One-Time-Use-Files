  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Modern utility theory studies preference orderings over choice sets and their numerical representations. Consider a decision maker (DM) who has to choose among a set
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   of alternatives. The set
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   is called the DM's choice set. In the deterministic case, which is our focus here, alternatives are certain, without any uncertainty. For example, in consumer theory, the DM is a consumer and
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   is the consumption set that he/she faces, that is, a subset of
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{R}^n
   </math>
   whose elements
   <math display="inline">
    x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)
   </math>
   represent the consumption bundles available to consumers. In intertemporal choice problems, X is a subset of
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{R}^{\infty}
   </math>
   , the space of sequences
   <math display="inline">
    \{x_t\}_{t=1}^{\infty}
   </math>
   , where
   <math display="inline">
    x_t
   </math>
   is the DM's outcome at time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   . Alternatives become more complicated objects under uncertainty, such as random variables in one-period problems and stochastic processes in intertemporal problems. This more general case is not considered here.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   DMs have some preferences over the elements of
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   ; they may like some alternatives more than others or may be indifferent among some of them. For example, in consumer theory consumers will rank consumption bundles in their consumption sets according to their tastes.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   This motivates the introduction of preference orderings
   <math display="inline">
    \succeq
   </math>
   defined on the choice set X. The ordering
   <math display="inline">
    \succeq
   </math>
   has the following interpretation: for any two vectors x and y in X, we write
   <math display="inline">
    x \succeq y
   </math>
   if the DM either strictly prefers
   <math display="inline">
    x
   </math>
   to
   <math display="inline">
    y
   </math>
   or is indifferent between the two.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The ordering
   <math display="inline">
    \succeq

   On the preference ordering
   <math display="inline">
    \succeq
   </math>
   , which is the theory's "raw material," some properties are considered.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Axiom 1 (Transitivity). For any three elements x, y, and z in X, if
   <math display="inline">
    x \succeq y

    y \succeq z

   <math display="inline">
    x \succeq z

   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Transitivity is a rationality assumption. Its violation generates cycles, for example,
   <math display="inline">
    x \succeq y \succeq z \succ x
   </math>
   . The most troublesome consequence of such cycles is that there might not exist a best element in the choice set X. For example, suppose that
   <math display="inline">
    X = \{x, y, z\}
   </math>
   and that
   <math display="inline">
    x \succ y
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    y \succ z
   </math>
   . If transitivity is violated, we get the cycle
   <math display="inline">
    x \succ y \succ z \succ x
   </math>
   and there is no best element in
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Axiom 2 (Completeness). For any two elements
   <math display="inline">
    x
   </math>
   and y in X,
   <math display="inline">
    x \succeq y
   </math>
   ,
   <math display="inline">
    y \succeq x
   </math>
   , or both.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   This is a simple, but not innocuous, property. A DM's preference
   <math display="inline">
    \succeq
   </math>
   satisfies this property if, when faced with any two alternatives in
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   , he/she can always say which one he/she prefers. As alternatives may be very different, this might be a strong requirement (see [1, 6], for weakenings of this assumption).
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Note that Axiom 2 implies reflexivity, that is,
   <math display="inline">
    x \succeq
   </math>
   x for all
   <math display="inline">
    x \in X
   </math>
   . When
   <math display="inline">
    \succeq
   </math>
   is reflexive and transitive (e.g., when it satisfies Axioms 1 and 2), following the consumer theory terminology, we call indifference curves the equivalence classes
   <math display="inline">
    [x] = \{y \in X : y \sim x\}
   </math>
   for any
   <math display="inline">
    x \in X
   </math>
   . We denote the collection
   <math display="inline">
    \{ [x] : x \in X \}
   </math>
   X} of all indifference curves by
   <math display="inline">
    X/\sim
   </math>
   , which is a partition of X. That is, each
   <math display="inline">
    x \in X
   </math>
   belongs to one, and only one, indifference curve.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Axioms 1 and 2 do not depend on any particular structure of the set
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   . In most applications, however, X is a subset of an ordered vector space
   <math display="inline">
    (V, \geq)
   </math>
   , that is, of a space
   <math display="inline">
    V
   </math>
   that has both a vector and an order structure. The space
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{R}^n
   </math>
   endowed with the natural order
   <math display="inline">
    &gt;
   </math>
   is an important example of an ordered vector space. Given any
   <math display="inline">
    x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n
   </math>
   , when the vectors x and y are regarded as consumption bundles,
   <math display="inline">
    x \ge y
   </math>
   means that the bundle
   <math display="inline">
    x
   </math>
   has at least as much of each good than the bundle
   <math display="inline">
    y
   </math>
   , while the convex combination
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha x + (1 - \alpha)y
   </math>
   is interpreted as a mix of the two vectors (implicitly we are assuming that goods are suitably divisible).
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The following axioms are based on the order and vector structures of
   <math display="inline">
    X

   . For simplicity, we assume
   <math display="inline">
    X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n
   </math>
   , though most of what follows holds in more general ordered vector spaces with units. Here,
   <math display="inline">
    x &gt; y
   </math>
   means
   <math display="inline">
    x \ge y

   and

    x \ne y

   (i.e.,

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   This axiom connects the order
   <math display="inline">
    \geq
   </math>
   on X and the DM's preference relation
   <math display="inline">
    \succeq
   </math>
   . In the context of consumer theory, it says that "the more, the better." In particular, given two vectors x and y with
   <math display="inline">
    x \ge y
   </math>
   , it is enough that
   <math display="inline">
    x
   </math>
   has strictly more of at least some good
   <math display="inline">
    i
   </math>
   to be strictly preferred to
   <math display="inline">
    y

   . This means that all goods are "essential" that is, the DM pays attention to each of them. Moreover, observe that, by Axiom 3 and reflexivity,
   <math display="inline">
    x \geq y
   </math>
   implies
   <math display="inline">
    x \succeq y
   </math>
   . This is because

    x \ge y

   Axiom 4 (Archimedean). Suppose that

   It may be useful to remember the analogous property that holds for real numbers: if

   </math>
   , and z are real numbers with

    -\infty

   , that is, the extended real line

   <math display="inline">
    x = \infty

   Axiom 5 (Convexity). Given any two elements

   This axiom captures a preference for mixing: given any two indifferent alternatives, the DM always prefers any of their combination to each of the original alternatives. This preference for mixing is often assumed in applications and is a convexity property of indifference curves,&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; the modern counterpart of the classic assumption of diminishing marginal utility.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Summing up, we have introduced a few properties that are often assumed on the preference
   <math display="inline">
    \succeq
   </math>
   . All these axioms are behavioral, that is, they are expressed
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   in terms of choice behavior. In particular, their behavioral meaning is transparent and, with the exception of the Archimedean axiom, they are all behaviorally falsifiable by suitable choice patterns. For example, one can show that a DM does not satisfy the transitivity axiom by finding alternatives
   <math display="inline">
    x, y, z \in X
   </math>
   over which his/her choices exhibit the cycle
   <math display="inline">
    x \succeq y \succeq z \succ x
   </math>
   . This choice pattern would be enough to reject the hypothesis that his/her preference over
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   is transitive.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The use of preference axioms that have a transparent behavioral interpretation and that are falsifiable through choice behavior is the main methodological tenet of modern utility theory, often called the revealed preference methodology. In fact, choice behavior data are regarded as the only observable data that economic theories can rely upon.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Another important methodological feature of modern utility theory is that it adopts a weak notion of rationality, which requires only the consistency of choices without any demand on their motives. For example, transitivity is viewed as a rationality requirement in this sense because its violations would entail inconsistent patterns of choices that no DM would consciously follow, regardless of his/her motivations (see [15], for a recent discussion of this methodological issue).

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Although the preference ordering

    (f \circ u)(x) - (f \circ u)(y) &lt; (f \circ u)(z) - (f \circ u)(w)

   . An important consequence of this observation is that incremental ratios of utility functions defined on subsets of
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{R}^n
   </math>
   have no interest, except for their sign. For example, the classic notion of decreasing marginal utility, which is based on properties of the partial derivatives
   <math display="inline">
    \partial u(x)/\partial x_k
   </math>
   , is thus meaningless in ordinal utility theory.

    Brief Historical Remarks
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The early development of utility theory is surveyed in the two 1950 articles of George Stigler [24]. Here it is worth noting that originally utility functions were regarded as a primitive notion whose role was to quantify a Benthamian pain/pleasure calculus. In other words, utility functions were viewed as a measure or a quantification of an underlying physiological phenomenon. This view of utility theory is sometimes called
   <i>
    cardinalism
   </i>
   and utility
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   functions derived within this approach are called
   <i>
    cardinal utility functions
   </i>
   . A key feature of cardinalism is that utility differences and their ratios are meaningful notions that quantify differences in pain/pleasure that DMs experience among different quantities of the outcomes. In particular, marginal utilities measure the marginal pain/pleasure that results from choices and these played a central role in the early cardinal consumer theory.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   However, the difficulty of any reliable scientific measurement of cardinal utility raised serious doubts on the scientific status of cardinalism. At the end of the nineteenth century Pareto revolutionized utility theory by showing that an ordinal approach, based on indifference curves as a primitive notion—unlike Edgeworth [7], who introduced them as level curves of an original cardinal utility function—was enough for consumer theory purposes [20]. In particular, Pareto showed that the classic consumer problem could be solved and characterized by replacing marginal utilities with marginal rates of substitutions along indifference curves. For example, the classic key assumption of diminishing marginal utilities is replaced by the convexity property (Axiom 5) of indifference curves (the latter is actually a stronger property, unless utility functions are separable).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Unlike cardinal utility functions, indifference curves and their properties can be empirically determined and tested. Pareto's insight thus represented a key methodological advance and his ordinal approach, later substantially extended by Hicks and Allen [17, 23], is today the mainstream version of consumer theory. More generally, Pareto's ordinal revolution paved the way to the modern use of preferences as the primitive notion of decision theory. In fact, the use of preferences is the natural conceptual development of Pareto's original insight of considering indifference curves as a primitive notion. The first appearance of preferences as primitive notions seems to be in [9, 13]. They earned their current central theoretical place in decision theory with the classic works [4, 9, 12].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The utility theory under certainty outlined here reached its maturity in the 1960s (see, e.g., [5]). Subsequent work on decision theory has been mainly concerned with choice under uncertainty, extending the scope of the seminal contributions [9, 10, 19, 21, 22]. We refer the reader to [14] for a thorough and updated introduction to these more recent advances.
