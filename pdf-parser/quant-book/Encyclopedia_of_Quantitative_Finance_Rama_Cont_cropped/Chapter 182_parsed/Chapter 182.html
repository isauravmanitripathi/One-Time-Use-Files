    Total Return Swap
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A total return swap (TRS) is a financial contract between two counterparties to synthetically replicate the economic returns of an underlying asset. The principal mechanism and interaction are shown in Figure 1.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The reference asset still belongs to the TRS payer, who is buying protection from the TRS receiver. This reference asset contains typically a fixed interest payment and experiences a certain credit risk to be protected. The TRS payer transfers any payment made by the reference asset to the TRS receiver, who conversely pays a variable payment (typically the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)) and a positive (or negative) spread as risk premium. Additionally, settlements for price depreciation and appreciations of the reference asset are made between the counterparties.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The TRS payer thus sells the market and credit risk of the reference asset to the TRS receiver without selling the reference asset itself. In the case of a credit event, the TRS receiver pays the difference between the value of the reference asset and the recovery value to the TRS payer. He acquires the counterparty risk of the TRS receiver instead.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Note that payments are not made continuously but rather at discrete times, that is, at given and specified reset periods. Occasionally, the reference asset consists of a whole portfolio of assets.

    Reasons for Investing in a Total Return Swap
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The TRS receiver explores the possibility of investing in the risk profile of the reference asset without owning it legally. Thus, insurance companies, hedge funds, and so on, count among the typical investors. They aim to work on a leveraged basis, diversify their portfolio, and achieve higher yields by taking on risk exposure. They can explore a synthetic way to make loans without having the costs and administrative burden; they explore possibilities to originating credit. Sometimes, for certain investors with capital constraints, TRS may be an effective way to leverage the use of capital.

   TRS payers are typically lenders and investors who want to reduce their respective exposure to the

   given borrower and potentially diversify a concentrated portfolio without removing the asset itself from their balance sheet, while maintaining the relationship with the borrower. However, TRS payers do not have to hold the asset itself on their balance sheets. If a TRS payer is taking an outright position, i.e. without holding the asset itself on the balance sheet, a TRS is an efficient way to go the asset short synthetically.

  <p block-type="Text">
   A TRS can help to activate comparative advantages of financing, depending on whether a certain market plays a role in a certain part of the market. Typically, a TRS is an off-balance-sheet deal.

    Comparison with an Outright Investment in the Bond
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The most striking difference from an outright investment in a bond or a loan is that with a TRS, price changes become cash flows at the predefined reset periods, at which settlements are made. For a bond, they are only accounting profits or losses and become effective at maturity or when the position is unwound. Thus, the TRS resembles a futures contract whereas the direct investment is more similar to a forward one (see, e.g., Schonbucher [3]). ¨

   Schonbucher [3] gives an indication about the payoff ¨ streams of a TRS from the point of view of the TRS receiver to be counted for valuation purposes:

  <p block-type="ListGroup">

     Initially the TRS is closed at a fair value; hence, no cash flow is proceeded.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     If the bond does not default, the TRS receiver pays a variable coupon plus (or minus) a spread at every predefined reset point; he receives the interest from the bond and the difference in market value of the bond since the last reset is exchanged.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     If the bond defaults, the TRS receiver pays for a last time the variable coupon plus (or minus) a spread and the difference between the last market value of the bond and its recovery.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Thus, several risk factors influence the value of the TRS: the interest rate risk driven by the changing yield curve and the default probability of the

   reference asset (we neglect, for instance, the counterparty risk). Typical valuation models include the Duffie–Singleton model, hazard rates, and forward measure. The credit risk is reflected in the fair spread (fair means that initially there has to be no cash flow) (see also Anson
