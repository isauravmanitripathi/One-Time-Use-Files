   Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov was born on April 25, 1903 and died on October 20, 1987 in the Soviet Union.

   Springer Verlag published (in German) Kolmogorov's monograph "Foundations of the Theory of Probability" more than seventy-five years ago [3]. In this small, 80-page book, he not only provided the logical foundation of the mathematical theory of probability (axiomatics) but also defined new concepts: conditional probability as a random variable, conditional expectations, notion of independency, the use of Borel fields of probability, and so on. The "Main theorem" in Chapter III "Probability in Infinite Spaces" indicated how to construct stochastic processes starting from their finite-dimensional distributions. His approach has made the development of modern mathematical finance possible.

   Before writing "Foundations of the Theory of Probability", Kolmogorov wrote his great paper "Analytical Methods in Probability Theory" [2], which gave birth to the theory of Markov processes in continuous time. In this paper, Kolmogorov presented his famous
   <i>
    forward and backward
   </i>
   differential equations, which are the often-used tools in probability theory and its applications. He also gave credit to L. Bachelier for the latter's pioneering investigations of probabilistic schemes evolving continuously in time.

   The two works mentioned earlier laid the groundwork for all subsequent developments of the theory of probability and stochastic processes. Today, it is impossible to imagine the state of these sciences without Kolmogorov's contributions.

   Kolmogorov developed many fundamentally important concepts that have determined the progress in different branches of mathematics and other branches of science and arts. Being an outstanding mathematician and scientist, he obtained, besides fundamental results in the theory of probability

   [5], the theory of trigonometric series, measure and set theory, the theory of integration, approximation theory, constructive logic, topology, the theory of superposition of functions and Hilbert's thirteenth problem, classical mechanics, ergodic theory, the theory of turbulence, diffusion and models of population dynamics, mathematical statistics, the theory of algorithms, information theory, the theory of automata and applications of mathematical methods in humanitarian sciences (including work in the theory of poetry, the statistics of text, and history), and the history and methodology of mathematics for school children and teachers of school mathematics [4–6]. For more descriptions of Kolmogorov's works, see [1, 7].
