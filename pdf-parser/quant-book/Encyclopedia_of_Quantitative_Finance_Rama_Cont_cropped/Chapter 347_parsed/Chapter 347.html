    Market Transparency
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Market transparency is the degree to which information is widely available to market participants; this overview of transparency will be confined to the transparency of the market trading process without considering issues related to disclosure about the fundamentals of the securities that are traded.a Given the importance of fleeting informational advantages in determining trading profits and losses, it is not surprising that transparency is and has been one of the most contentious issues in the design and regulation of trading systems. Financial economists' research—including theoretical modeling, experimental work, and empirical research—has also yielded a wide range of insights and results that provide a fairly ambivalent view of whether imposing transparency is desirable, or even feasible. There are conflicting interests between market participants along a variety of dimensions: informed or uninformed traders, liquidity-seeking ("buy-side")
   <i>
    versus
   </i>
   liquidity-supplying ("sell-side") agents, large
   <i>
    versus
   </i>
   small traders, broker-dealers
   <i>
    versus
   </i>
   agency brokers, as well as trading venues competing for transactions and listings. These gains and losses shape the trading and regulatory landscape.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The degree of transparency varies widely across instruments and markets. The United States market for major listed stocks is traditionally the most transparent. Since the 1975 amendments to the Securities Exchange Act, consolidated market information has been made available through designated exclusive securities information processors (SIP) that aggregate both quote information and trade reports. Over the years, the amount of information made available has been upgraded considerably.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   At the other extreme lie the markets in thinly traded securities like municipal bonds, which are typically traded over the counter (OTC) by brokerdealers who fill most of their customers' orders in a principal capacity, and who trade among themselves in an interdealer market to manage their inventories. No firm prices are quoted, and information regarding the prices of completed trades is only made available for the most frequently traded issues, and that too only with a 1-day lag.

    Pretrade or Quote Transparency
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Most theoretical models argue that pretrade transparency benefits the buy side. Several mechanisms have been suggested.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Biais [9] considers a setting where market makers differ in their inventories (and thus in their reservation value for the security) but are otherwise taken to be approximately risk neutral and in agreement on the fundamental value of the security. He compares two market structures: (i) a transparent market in which dealer quotes can be observed by all market participants and (ii) an opaque market structure in which competing dealers have no information on the quotes of their peers. Effectively, the former is an English auction and the latter is a sealed-bid auction, and market makers' bidding strategies differ in the two settings. The "revenue equivalence theorem" of auction theory applies to this setting (risk-neutral bidders with independent, identically distributed private values) so that, as Biais concludes, the expected spread will be the same in both market structures. Beyond this stylized setting, textbook auction theory states that revenue equivalence breaks down if the bidders (the market makers) are truly risk averse, their private valuations are correlated or asymmetrically distributed, or there is an imperfectly known common value leading to a winner's curse problem [14]. In particular, within Biais's setting, de Frutos and Manzano [19] treat market-maker risk aversion without approximations and conclude that the opaque market is more liquid.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Yin [46] extends the analysis of Biais [9] by incorporating the idea that quote transparency exerts competitive pressure by eliminating customers' search costs, building on Diamond's [20] classic insight that search costs, no matter how small, can effectively destroy price competition and lead to monopoly pricing. Yin [46] considers the case in which customers
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   must pay a search cost in the opaque market, finding that the average bid–ask spread is smaller in the transparent market.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Evidence from the municipal bond market [28, 30, 43] illustrates the scope for rent extraction in an opaque setting. Municipal bond trading costs are substantially higher than those for equities, and particularly high for retail-sized trades relative to institutional trades, presumably because the investors are less-sophisticated negotiators. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) report (2004) shows that for retail transactions (around $10 000), an over-3% difference in the prices charged by different dealers filling orders within the same day is quite common (over 9% of transactions), even though normally intraday fluctuations in the fundamental value of the securities are zero or minimal; meanwhile, for large and more sophisticated institutional transactions (sized around $1 million) a difference of over 1% is rare (0.4% of transactions) and a difference of over 2% absent in the sample.b And although it is possible to verify
   <i>
    ex post
   </i>
   the prices of other transactions in a bond on the day of an order, investors rarely avail themselves of this opportunity to check up on their broker's diligence and probity. Only the professional competence, energy, and sense of duty of the broker, limits the extent of price gouging. The underlying problem is that best execution has no teeth in a setting where individual securities are so thinly traded that it makes no sense for any market maker to spend the time and effort needed to quote continuous prices at which he/she is committed to trade. As a result, there is no firmly quoted, easily identifiable going market price. For more thickly traded securities, market makers are willing to quote prices anyway, because they see enough trading volume to recoup occasional losses to traders who hit stale quotes.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Interestingly, Biais and Green [10] show that the bond markets—both corporate and municipal—have not always been as opaque as they have been in the last decades. Their research shows that when bonds were centrally traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the early decades of the twentieth century, transaction costs for retail investors were substantially lower than they were on the OTC markets to which trading migrated after the 1940s.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   A second mechanism whereby pretrade transparency can improve liquidity is analyzed by Pagano and Roell [38], who argue that in a centralized market ¨
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where all trading interest is exposed before transactions take place, liquidity providers are better able to gauge the extent of informed trading. This reduces the indirect transfer of informational rents (in the form of transaction costs induced by adverse selection) from uninformed to informed traders.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In early 1997, the SEC instituted new orderhandling rules that further enhanced transparency; in particular, the "Limit Order Display Rule" that requires dealers to execute or display customers' limit orders that improve upon their own (or send them on to a competitor), ensuring that best-priced limit orders are displayed to all market participants; and the "quote rule" requiring dealers who place quotes in multiple trading systems to make their best quotes available to the public. Both led to an immediate and substantial reduction in trading costs [2].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Hendershott and Jones [32] consider the impact of a 2002 regulatory enforcement action, which prompted the Island electronic communications network to suspend the display of the limit order book in its three most actively traded exchange traded funds (ETFs) for over a year. They find that quote display reduces trading costs and retains price discovery on Island, and that both transparency and reduced fragmentation play important roles in enhancing liquidity.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Baruch [3] argues that the introduction of an open limit order book on a monopoly specialist market such as the NYSE has the further advantage of reducing the informational advantage of the NYSE specialist over other liquidity providers. Leveling the playing field in this manner reduces the specialist's participation rate and profits, and ensures better prices for immediacy demanders at the expense of the sell side. The evidence provided by Barclay
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [2] and Boehmer
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [13] agrees with this analysis, but Madhavan
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [36] document that an earlier similar reform in Toronto led to reduced liquidity, though it did reduce specialist profit as predicted. They argue that too much transparency increases the "free option" cost of posting limit orders [18], leading to order withdrawal and a reduction in market depth, as well as diverting institutional trading volume away from the central market due to concerns about front running. However, more recently, Eom
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [23] do find that pretrade transparency enhances liquidity on Korea's electronic order-driven market, arguing that the Toronto findings may have been driven by endogeneity bias.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   While desirable in theory, the amount of pretrade transparency that is achievable is limited to the extent that market participants are unwilling to publicly display firm quotes or limit orders, so that enforced limit order exposure may lead to a less deep limit order book. Many traders avail themselves of the opportunity to hide their intentions by posting large orders as "hidden orders" that are not publicly displayed in full; the hidden depth only shows up onscreen as and when the visible limit orders are knocked out by trading activity. The popularity of this strategy suggests that it may well substantially increase the depth of the limit order book; see [8] for a description of the use of hidden orders on Euronext Paris. The proliferation of "dark pools" of liquidity also points to the wish to keep trading interest at least to some extent out of the public eye, mitigating problems associated with front running and free options.

  <h2>
   <b>
    Posttrade Transparency
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Promptly published information regarding the price, size, and perhaps even the identity of the counterparties involved in recent transactions provides an invaluable guide to market sentiment. Extending such information to all market participants would enable price quoters and limit order placers to compete more effectively, because they would not need to worry as much about the threat of being undercut by peers who have better information regarding recent trades. However, many practitioners have argued that this is not the case and that large traders, in particular, can obtain better prices if their trades are not published. When an order can be observed exclusively by the market maker who fills it, he/she can use the information conveyed by the order to make a profit on subsequent trading, and therefore his/her price quotes for the initial trade will be keener. In this respect, market makers have been likened to the bookmaker who declared himself happy to lose money to a particularly successful punter: "He's my most valuable client. I always shorten the odds when he bets, and it saves me a fortune."
   <sup>

   </sup>
   The basic idea was first modeled by Kyle [33] and Roell ¨ [41], who argue that under competitive market making, the overall net impact of posttrade opaqueness involves more favorable prices for informed traders and higher transaction costs for uninformed traders overall. Moreover, market makers who are not subjected to last trade publication can outcompete any
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   who are, so that with competition between multiple exchanges or between on- and off-exchange dealers, order flow is likely to gravitate to the least posttrade transparent setting. Madhavan [35] further shows that, because information-driven trades tend to be on the large side, large uninformed traders whose transactions are similar in size may benefit from opaqueness alongside informed traders, with retail uninformed investors bearing the full burden.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Experimental work by Bloomfield and O'Hara [11, 12] is consistent with these predictions, showing that competing dealers are willing to narrow their price quotes at the start of a trading game in an opaque market in order to capture order flow (though surprisingly, they do not fully recoup the initial losses at a later stage). Moreover, dealers who are not obliged to reveal their trades outcompete those who do have to, and dealers prefer to be nontransparent if given the choice.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Empirical evidence regarding the impact of posttrade transparency is mixed. Gemmill [26] does not discern a significant impact on liquidity from three different trade publication regimes (no publication, 90-min delayed publication and 24-h delayed publication) on the London Stock Exchange. This is surprising in light of the fact that throughout the period studied, London market makers steadfastly and vociferously campaigned against prompt last trade publication on the grounds that it would curtail their ability to offer attractive terms, particularly for wholesale trades. As Gemmill points out, they may have been more concerned with a potential loss of business to off-exchange dealers than with the equilibrium impact on market pricing that is the focus of the study.

   Recent work on the institutional market for corporate bonds finds that improved posttrade transparency has led to a dramatic decline in execution costs. Starting in 2002, last trade publication through the TRACE system was phased in for the US investmentgrade corporate bond market; and the reporting lag has been reduced over the years from 75 to 15 min. Studies by Bessembinder
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [7], Edwards
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [22], and Goldstein
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [27] all conclude that trade publication led to significant declines in transaction costs. As in the municipal bond market, transaction costs are largest for retail-size trades, and the benefits of transparency have been most significant at the retail end. Moreover, the greater transparency has mitigated the informational advantage of the larger
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   dealers, reducing their market share. The studies estimate that the reduction in transaction costs as a result of TRACE represents roughly a $1bn per year reduction in corporate bond dealers' market-making revenue. Bessembinder and Maxwell [6] report that, not surprisingly, many bond traders, analysts, brokers, and salesmen have seen substantial reductions in their earnings and exited the market. Post-TRACE, dealers conduct less fundamental analysis and are less willing to hold inventories, so that locating bonds involves more search over multiple intermediaries. On the positive side, TRACE seems to have facilitated the development of an electronic limit order market (Market Axess) in corporate bonds, and possibly contributed to the NYSE's ongoing initiative to upgrade its trading platform for bonds of listed companies.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   If prompt trade publication is desirable, is it enforceable, and does it have unintended consequences? If reported trades are published quickly, market participants will find it in their interest to delay the reporting. Franks and Schaefer [25] point out that trade reporting deadlines can be evaded by the use of "protected trades": market makers informally offer a price to a customer for a large deal (with the understanding that they will, in practice, honor the commitment), but the deal is not officially finalized and confirmed until they have had time to unwind the resulting inventory. This delays the trade report—and its publication—beyond the regulators' intention. Moreover, it reduces immediacy and imposes some execution risk on large traders. Porter and Weaver [39] provide evidence that Nasdaq market makers indeed use late trade reporting to manage the flow of information: trades reported "out of sequence" (thus evading the 90 s reporting deadline) are disproportionately large in size and much too common to be attributable to legitimate causes (such as computer glitches). An additional concern is that trading will migrate to venues that do not impose as much posttrade transparency. Many observers of the migration of the wholesale markets in European blue chip equities to London in the early 1990s have argued that the lack of trade publication on SEAQ International was a primary determinant. Europe-wide negotiations on market regulation and transparency have typically pitted the looser, more freewheeling regime of the London wholesale markets against the more centralized transparent regime prevailing in the home markets.

    Optimal Transparency
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Most studies focus on the effects of market transparency on market liquidity, informational efficiency, and the distribution of trading profits among market participants. Unless the general public's motivation for trading is fully articulated, explicit analysis of Pareto gains is ruled out. Some models do postulate that trading arises as a portfolio rebalancing response of risk-averse agents to random endowments, permitting some measure of analysis of deadweight gains and losses.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Cespa and Foucault [15] study how posttrade transparency affects allocative efficiency. Specifically, they consider a dynamic rational expectations model in the manner of Hellwig [31] in which only a fraction of investors observe transaction prices in real time. They show that it is never Pareto optimal to distribute information on past transaction prices to all investors: in their setting, risk sharing is more efficient when the market is not fully transparent. The reason is that dissemination of information thwarts risk sharing through the so-called Hirshleifer effect as well as intensifying competition among investors.

    Anonymity
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   One aspect of transparency that has attracted considerable attention is the degree to which traders' (or at least their brokers') trading motivations and/or identities are revealed, either pre- or posttrade. The information that is potentially available goes beyond the size, direction, and price of quotes and order flow. We group a discussion of the treatment of such items of information here under the heading of anonymity.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Pretrade Anonymity
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Most papers on anonymity focus on pretrade transparency. Some market structures, such as telephone dealership markets or floor markets, allow buy-side investors or their representatives to share information on their trading motives. Naturally, these market structures are nonanonymous. In general, nonanonymous pretrade communication among traders reduces adverse selection and improves liquidity.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   For instance, Admati and Pfleiderer [1] show that if customers can "sunshine trade", that is, publicly

   based on superior information, they can improve the price at which they trade. Roell [42] shows ¨ that even if such information is conveyed exclusively to the uninformed customer's broker-dealer, at least some of the benefits remain, with the brokerdealer absorbing ("internalizing") roughly half the customer's order flow on own account. In both cases, the customer benefits, though as a result of the withdrawal of a part of the liquidity-driven order flow noise, the market at large becomes less liquid for other traders, namely, both information-based traders as well as those liquidity traders who are unable to certify their lack of information. Easley
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [21] present evidence consistent with the idea that purchased order flow similarly involves cream skimming of order flow that is thought to be noninformationdriven; however, Battalio
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [4] find no adverse impact on the liquidity of the main market when opportunities for internalization are introduced on competing regional exchanges, possibly due to intensified competition as order flow is drawn away.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The converse situation arises when informed traders show their hand. Chung
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [16] consider the impact of the special arrangements whereby Swiss companies can publicly repurchase their own shares on a separate, nonanonymous "second trading line" platform. Price movements around the repurchases are consistent with the notion that share repurchases convey positive information, and the mechanism seems to have a positive impact on the liquidity of the main market, which can arguably be attributed to reduced asymmetries of information.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Benveniste
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [5] emphasize another benefit of nonanonymous pretrade communication: it enables market makers and their clients to enter into longterm implicit contracts. In this way, market makers can incentivize their clients to disclose whether their trade is informed or not and adjust their quotes accordingly. Benveniste
   <i>
    et al.

   go on to show that price discrimination between informed and uninformed investors is Pareto-improving.

   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [24] and Rindi [40]. Rindi assumes that limit orders are placed both by informed and uninformed agents, for instance, as in [29]. Disclosure of liquidity suppliers' identities enables market participants to observe informed traders' limit orders. The resulting reduction in the profitability of trading on information discourages the acquisition of information. Paradoxically this means that transparency can sometimes reduce liquidity because when fewer competing traders obtain information, risk averse liquidity suppliers, facing more uncertainty about the asset's value, are less willing to bid aggressively. Foucault
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [24] consider a model in which limit order traders are differentially informed about future volatility. Better informed limit order traders can better control their exposure to the risk of being picked off and therefore earn larger expected profits. These rents, however, are limited as uninformed limit order traders draw inferences about the risk of being picked off from the bids placed in the limit order book. These inferences are noisier in an anonymous environment as limit order traders cannot tell whether quotes are set by informed traders or uninformed traders, leading to different bidding strategies by limit order traders in the anonymous and the nonanonymous market. Consequently, disclosing information about liquidity suppliers' identities should affect market liquidity and the informativeness of the limit order book about future volatility. In particular, this identifies conditions under which the anonymous market is more liquid.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Foucault
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [24] provide empirical evidence consistent with these predictions, using data from Euronext Paris, where the limit order book became anonymous in 2001. They show that the switch to anonymity is associated with an increase in liquidity and a decrease in the informativeness of the limit order book about future volatility. Comerton-Forde
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [17] conduct a similar empirical analysis for a larger sample of stocks listed on the Paris Bourse, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and the Korea Stock Exchange. They also find that liquidity is larger in the anonymous environment for the three markets considered in their study.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   An alternative hypothesis consistent with the evidence that pretrade sell-side anonymity enhances liquidity is proposed by Simaan

   [44], who argue that disclosing liquidity suppliers' identities facilitates collusion. They find that dealers post more

   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [37] consider a model with risk-averse market makers who, after first trading with a member of the public whose trade may have some information content, go on to rebalance the inventory on an interdealer market. They show that as long as market makers do not learn anything beyond the order size from their customer, a regime with prompt publication of the initial order yields a better price for the customer than in an opaque regime because there are no asymmetries of information to thwart optimal risk sharing at the second stage. However, if market makers are able to learn more from their customer than what is contained in the order size alone (in particular, if they learn what proportion of an order is information-driven) they will rebate informationdriven order flow to such an extent that customers on average might prefer an opaque market without trade publication, because it offers better insurance against price risk.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Lastly, the identities of the parties to a transaction can be disclosed after a transaction. Waisburd [45] analyzes the effect of providing this type of information, using data from the Paris bourse. He considers a sample of stocks trading in two different regimes: one in which brokers' identities are revealed posttrade and one in which these identities are concealed. He finds that liquidity is lower in the posttrade anonymous regime. Interestingly, these results go in the opposite direction to those obtained for pretrade anonymity by Foucault
   <i>

   [24] or Comerton-Forde

    Concluding Comments
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Our survey has focused on transparency of the trading process, both in terms of quote display for prospective trades and publication of information regarding completed transactions. It is clear from the current crisis that transparency regarding the solvency of potential trading counterparties plays an important role in the functioning of markets during periods of high volatility. The pros and cons of central clearing
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   systems in providing collective insurance against counterparty risk is a topical but underanalyzed issue. The question of the pricing of transparency, and the costs of collecting and disseminating data, has also received more attention in the policy debate than in formal academic research.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Lastly, it should be clear that decisions regarding how much transparency is to be imposed are political. The beneficiaries of opaqueness tend to be large players such as bond dealers and banks. Such players have resisted the advent of transparent, centralized electronic trading in the bond markets, and they generally take ownership stakes in the competing platforms as a means of exerting influence. Active regulatory intervention may be needed to promote the interests of market participants who are not organized and influential.
