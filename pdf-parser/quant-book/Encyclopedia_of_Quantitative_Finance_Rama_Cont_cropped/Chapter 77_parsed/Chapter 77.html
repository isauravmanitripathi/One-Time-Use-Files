   Superhedging
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Pricing and hedging of contingent claims are the two main problems of mathematical finance. They both have a clear and transparent solution when the underlying market model is complete, that is, for each contingent claim with promised payoff

   there exists a self-financing admissible trading strategy whose wealth at maturity equals
   <math display="inline">
    H
   </math>
   (see Complete
   <b>
    Markets

   ). Such a strategy is called the
   <i>
    hedging
   </i>
   strategy of the contingent claim
   <math display="inline">
    H
   </math>
   . The smallest initial wealth that allows to reach
   <math display="inline">
    H
   </math>
   at maturity
   <i>

   admissible trading is called the

   of

  <p block-type="Text">
   Under a suitable no-arbitrage assumption (see Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing), the second fundamental theorem of asset pricing (see Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing) states that replicability of every contingent claim is equivalent to the uniqueness of the equivalent martingale measure
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{Q}
   </math>
   (see Equivalent Martingale Measures).
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   It turns out that in a complete market (see Com

    t = 0
   </math>

   <math display="inline">

   If the market model is incomplete, there exist contingent claims that are not perfectly replicable
   <i>
    via
   </i>
   admissible trading strategies. In other words, in such financial models, contingent claims are not redundant assets. Therefore, since perfect replicability cannot be always achieved, this requirement has to be relaxed. One way of doing this consists in introducing the concept of
   <i>
    superhedging

   .

   Superhedging was introduced and investigated first by El Karoui and Quenez [13, 14] in a continuous-time setting where the risky assets follow a multidimensional diffusion process. Independently, Naik and Uppal [25] studied the same problem in a discrete-time model with finite set of scenarios and

  <p block-type="Text">
   noticed that, in the presence of leverage constraints, superhedging may be cheaper than perfect hedging. The same phenomenon has been observed by Benais et al. [1] in the presence of transaction costs.

  <p block-type="Text">
   The characterization of superhedging strategies and prices is the object of a family of results called superhedging theorems.

  <p block-type="Text">
   A large literature has been devoted to characterizing the set of all initial endowments that allows to superhedge a contingent claim
   <math display="inline">
    H
   </math>
   as a first crucial step to compute the superhedging price, the infimum of that set. In this article, we focus essentially on continuous-time hedging of European options, that is, with a fixed exercise time
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   , and distinguish between two cases: frictionless incomplete markets and markets with frictions. For superhedging in discrete-time models and for American options, the interested reader could see respectively Föllmer and Schied's book [17] and American Options.

   To facilitate the discussion, let us fix the notation first. We consider a market model composed of
   <math display="inline">

   </math>
   risky assets whose discounted price dynamics is described by a càdlàg and locally bounded semimartingale
   <math display="inline">
    S = (S_t)_{t \in [0,T]}
   </math>
   , where
   <math display="inline">
    T &gt; 0
   </math>
   is a given finite time horizon.
   <i>
    S

   is defined on a probability space

   are already discounted; this is equivalent to assuming that the spot interest rate

   over all equivalent martingale measures, it becomes apparent that pursuing a superhedging strategy can be too expensive, depending on the financial model and on the constraints on portfolios. This is the main disadvantage of such a criterion, which is, nonetheless, of great interest as a benchmark. Moreover, for an agent with a large risk aversion and under transaction costs (see the section Markets with Frictions), the reservation price approaches the superhedging price, as established in

   .

  <p block-type="Text">
   El Karoui and Quenez [13, 14] first proved the superhedging theorem in an Itô's diffusion setting and Delbaen and Schachermayer [10, 11] generalized it to, respectively, a locally bounded and unbounded semimartingale model, using a Hahn-Banach separation argument.

  <p block-type="Text">
   The superhedging theorem can be extended in order to characterize the dynamics of the minimal superhedging portfolio of a contingent claim

   <math display="inline">

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   wealth. This extension is a consequence of the socalled
   <i>
    optional decomposition of supermartingales
   </i>
   . The optional decomposition was first proved in [13, 14] for diffusions and then extended to general semimartingales by Kramkov [24], Föllmer and Kabanov [15], and Delbaen and Schachermayer [12]. This is a very deep result of the general theory of stochastic processes and roughly states that any càdlàgpositive
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{Q}
   </math>
   -supermartingale X, for any
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{Q} \in \mathcal{M}^e

  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    \theta

   is a predictable, S-integrable process and C an increasing optional process, to be interpreted as a cumulative consumption process. What is remarkable is that the local martingale part can be represented as a stochastic integral with respect to
   <math display="inline">
    S
   </math>
   so that it is a local martingale under any equivalent martingale measure
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{Q}

   . In this sense, decomposition (4) is universal. The price to pay is that the increasing process

   is, in general, not predictable as in the Doob-Meyer decomposition (see
   <b>

   In the previous section, we made the implicit assumption that investors can trade in continuous time and without frictions.
