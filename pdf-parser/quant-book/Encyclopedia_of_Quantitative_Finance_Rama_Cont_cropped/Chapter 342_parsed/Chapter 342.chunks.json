The ability of call auctions to contain this volatility and improve market quality has also been established [2, 11–13, 15]. Nevertheless, Ellul <i>et al.</i> [6] suggest that the call \"suffers from a high failure rate to open and close trading especially when trading conditions are difficult.\" The theoretical analysis of order submission to a call auction by Chakraborty <i>et al.</i> [3] also shows the difficulty of getting early order submission (a \"bookbuilding\" problem); these authors suggest that the effectiveness of a call depends on structural issues such as its transparency and whether or not it includes a market maker to \"animate\" bookbuilding.</p>",
