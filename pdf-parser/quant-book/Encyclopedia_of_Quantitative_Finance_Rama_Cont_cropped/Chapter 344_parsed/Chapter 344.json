What makes the specialist on the NYSE different from other traders is the ability to condition his or her participation as a dealer and the prices in which he or she transacts on the size of the arriving market order (due to the specialist's control over the execution of trades).</p>",

Back and Baruch [3] allow traders to \"work\" the orders by splitting their demand and trading it over time in smaller increments. When traders behave in this fashion, the <i>ex post</i> pricing power of the specialist assumed in [15, 16] and [19] no longer gives the specialist an advantage. The reason is that even if the specialist can condition on the size of the arriving market order, he does not know whether it is part of a much larger order of an informed trader that is worked over time (i.e., he cannot condition on the size of the demand underlying the order). The specialist market structure therefore does not offer any general advantage over the pure limit order book.a</p>",

In addition, [5] and [7] note that the informational efficiency of prices could be enhanced by the presence of a designated market maker. The reason is that obligations of the specialists to maintain price continuity or narrow spreads increase the profitability of informed trading and therefore more investors optimally choose to invest in gathering and analyzing information.
