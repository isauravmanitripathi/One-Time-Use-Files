# **Mutual Funds**

After a major financial crisis in 1773–1774, a Dutch broker founded an investment company that would buy bonds from issuers located in different countries. (For a detailed history of mutual funds, see [1].) Shareholders received an annual report and could periodically check assets and company books. This first example of a mutual fund contains all the elements of the modern collective investment vehicle: a professional manager, a pool of assets, diversification, and governance.

While modern mutual funds can take several legal shapes, such as partnerships and limited-liability corporations, they all perform two important functions: (i) asset management carried out by an expert and (ii) diversified exposure to investment assets.

Mutual funds are beneficial for people who lack the time or expertise necessary to select individual securities. By buying shares in a mutual fund, investors can capitalize on a professional fund manager's expertise and experience. The manager is responsible for building a portfolio consistent with her mandate.

In addition to expert management, mutual funds give investors, of all skill levels, the benefit of higher diversification. For example, Person A has \$1000 to invest, and one share of Company B costs \$1000. To invest in Company B, Person A would have to invest his entire portfolio in that single stock. If Company B were to go bankrupt, the investor would lose everything. However, if Person A were to pool his money with 10 other investors with \$1000 each, they could purchase shares of several different companies. The resulting portfolio's returns would reflect the average return of several stocks rather than just one. Since stocks can move differently from one another (i.e., one stock may gain as another loses), this pooling will reduce the portfolio's risk overall. Mutual funds provide these benefits on a large scale (*see* **Diversification**; **Modern Portfolio Theory**).

Mutual funds manage tens of trillions of dollars worldwide. Morningstar, an investment analysis and rating company, had over 54 000 different mutual fund portfolios in its worldwide database in February 2008. There were 7054 open-end mutual funds in the Morningstar database for the United States, 287 of which (4%) were pure index funds. According to Morningstar, in February 2008, index funds had about 10% of the US open-end mutual fund assets—not including "enhanced index" and similar hybrid strategies (the Morningstar data cited in this paragraph do not include money market funds).

## **Legal Types of Mutual Fund**

Mutual funds have different legal forms. Open-end mutual funds are investment companies that sell a variable number of shares of a pool of assets. In this type of fund, when an investor wants to buy shares, she contacts the investment company, which issues new shares of the fund. If the investor needs to liquidate her position, the company liquidates some of the fund's assets and pays the investor the share's current market price, called *net asset value* (*NAV* ).

Closed-end mutual funds are just like holding companies. The number of shares is predetermined, and shares are bought and sold on the stock market. No contact between issuer and investors occurs after the initial public offering.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a special type of closed-end funds (*see* **Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs)**). The peculiarity of ETFs is that their number of shares is variable, and can be increased when an institutional investor, called *authorized participant*, presents the issuer a bundle of assets replicating the ETF's portfolio. The bundle is exchanged for new shares of the ETF. Similarly, authorized participants can redeem ETF shares in kind, receiving portfolio assets from the issuer. As a result, ETF prices reflect the prices of the underlying assets exactly.

Since they are sold to the public, both openand closed-end funds are regulated in most countries and have strict standards regarding their mandates and disclosures. In contrast, hedge funds are a kind of fund that is not available to most investors; therefore, it is generally unregulated. This allows hedge funds to have more flexible mandates. As a result, hedge funds often are both potentially lucrative and risky (*see* **Hedge Funds**).

## **Investment-based Classification**

Mutual funds differ by investment mandate. The first type of mandate specifies whether the manager must strictly reproduce the returns of a given index (*see* **Electricity Markets**). As explained in [2], an index is a market average. By definition, about half of the investors will have returns exceeding the market average and half will have returns that fall short. Therefore, a reasonable strategy is to pursue the market average. A fund that adopts this strategy is called an *index fund*. Index funds have several advantages. First, because the market is diversified, an index fund's portfolio will have limited idiosyncratic risk. Second, since replicating a market index is rather inexpensive, index funds' management fees are low. Third, in countries taxing realized capital gains, index funds trigger limited capital gains because indexes turn over their portfolios relatively rarely.

The opposite of an index (or passive) fund is an actively managed fund. In an actively managed fund, the index's returns act as a benchmark rather than a target. The fund manager aims to exceed the benchmark, and he/she is free to choose different assets within his/her mandate to meet this goal (*see* **Capital Asset Pricing Model**).

ETFs started as passive investments, that is, indexbased products. More recently, ETFs have branched out into direct investment in commodities such as gold bullion as well as in indexes based on complex trading strategies. While this increases the choices for investors, it often increases fees, too.

Index funds and passive ETFs initially tracked very broad indexes to provide diversified market exposure at low cost. It is now possible to find index funds and ETFs tracking very specialized indexes such as single countries, sectors, or currencies. In this way, an investor can overweight a narrow segment of the market. With ETFs, it is possible to also short market sectors that the investor considers overvalued (*see* **Hedging**).

A second mandate classification categorizes funds in terms of the kinds of securities that the fund manager can purchase. Equity funds invest in stocks, bond funds invest in debt instruments, and money market funds invest in short-term bonds. In some countries, including the United States, money market funds have legal limits on the credit risk of the bonds they can purchase.

Hybrid funds, also called *balanced* or *asset allocation funds*, invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Hybrid funds are often intended to be the only fund in a portfolio, because they contain a balanced exposure to several asset classes.

Funds in each of these broad categories—equity, bond, money market, and hybrid—can be further subdivided according to their specialization. For example, a fund manager may invest exclusively in US large-cap equity, Australian Dollar money market instruments, or Euro Zone high-yield bonds; another fund manager may have a different mandate and run a conservative balanced fund. Management style (*see* **Style Analysis**) is another common asset-based categorization of equity portfolios.

## **Expense-based Classification**

Open-end funds are called *no-load* if they only charge an annual management fee, which is a percentage of assets. A load is a commission charged either when the investor buys (front load) or sells (back load) the shares. Loads compensate brokers and management companies. In general, a front-load fund has lower annual management fees. Many back-load funds waive loads for investors who have kept their shares for several years.

Closed-end funds do not have loads, but they do have annual management fees. Also, they may have a bid–ask spread and brokerage commission just like a regular stock.

Hedge funds generally have a management fee as well as a performance fee. For example, a hedge fund charging "2 and 20" has an annual management fee of 2% of its assets and a performance fee of 20% of all profits exceeding a certain threshold (called the *hurdle*).

## **Performance Evaluation**

Specialized companies, such as Morningstar and Lipper, collect information about mutual funds' returns, fees, investment styles, and costs. They also provide peer comparisons, which rely on proprietary measures (e.g., the Morningstar Rating) or on risk-adjusted measures envisioned by academics (*see* **Sharpe Ratio**; **Performance Measures**). The purpose of these comparisons is to help investors select skilled managers and avoid those who do not add value.

Modern portfolio theory suggests that the riskier assets should, on average, have higher returns. Hence, it is appropriate to use risk-adjusted measures to avoid confusing managers who have higher longterm returns because they take more risk (*see* **Capital** **Asset Pricing Model**) from managers who add value without adding risk.
