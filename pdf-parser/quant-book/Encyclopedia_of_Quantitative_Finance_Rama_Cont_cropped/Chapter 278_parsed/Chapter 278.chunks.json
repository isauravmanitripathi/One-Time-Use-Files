For example, Person A has $1000 to invest, and one share of Company B costs $1000. To invest in Company B, Person A would have to invest his entire portfolio in that single stock. If Company B were to go bankrupt, the investor would lose everything. However, if Person A were to pool his money with 10 other investors with $1000 each, they could purchase shares of several different companies. The resulting portfolio's returns would reflect the average return of several stocks rather than just one. Since stocks can move differently from one another (i.e., one stock may gain as another loses), this pooling will reduce the portfolio's risk overall. Mutual funds provide these benefits on a large scale (<i>see</i> <b>Diversification</b>; <b>Modern Portfolio Theory</b>).</p>",
