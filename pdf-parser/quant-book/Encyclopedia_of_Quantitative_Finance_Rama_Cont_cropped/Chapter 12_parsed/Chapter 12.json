Although remarkably close to the Black–Scholes–Merton model, Bachelier's formula was flawed because he used normally distributed stock prices that violated limited liability.

In this article, they also showed that the option's price could be viewed as its discounted expected value, where instead of using the actual probabilities to compute the expectation, one employs utility or risk-adjusted probabilities (see expression (20) on page 26). These risk-adjusted probabilities are now known as \"risk-neutral\" or \"equivalent martingale\" probabilities. Contrary to a widely held belief, the use of \"equivalent martingale probabilities\" in option pricing theory predated the paper by Cox and Ross [36] by nearly 10 years (Merton (footnote 5 p. 218, [107]) points out that Samuelson knew this fact as early as 1953).</p>",

This dependency made the formulas difficult to estimate and to use. The reason for this difficulty is that the empirical finance literature has documented that the stock's risk premium is nonstationary. It varies across time according to both changing tastes and changing economic fundamentals. This nonstationarity makes both the modeling of risk premium and their estimation problematic. Indeed, at present, there is still no generally accepted model for an asset's risk premium that is consistent with historical data (see [32], Part IV for a review).</p>",

The first two assumptions —competitive and frictionless markets —are the mainstay of finance. Competitive markets means that all traders act as price takers, believing their trades have no impact on the market price. Frictionless markets imply that there are no transaction costs nor trade restrictions, for example, no short sale constraints. Geometric Brownian motion implies that the stock price is lognormally distributed with a constant volatility. Deterministic interest rates are selfexplanatory. No credit risk means that the investors (all counterparties) who trade financial securities will not default on their obligations.</p>",

Recall that a defining characteristic of the Black–Scholes–Merton model is that it assumes deterministic interest rates. This assumption limits its usefulness in two ways. First, it cannot be used for long-dated contracts. Indeed, for long-dated contracts (greater than a year or two), interest rates cannot be approximated as being deterministic. Second, for short-dated contracts, if the underlying asset's price process is highly correlated with interest rate movements, then interest rate risk will affect hedging, and therefore valuation. The extreme cases, of course, are interest rate derivatives where the underlyings are the interest rates themselves.</p>",

New interest rate risk management tools were needed because the Black–Scholes–Merton model was not useful in this regard. In response, a class of interest rate pricing models were developed by Vasicek [124], Brennan and Schwartz [17], and Cox <i>et al.</i> (CIR) [35]. This class, called the <i>spot rate mod</i><i>els</i>, had two limitations. First, they depended on the market price(s) of interest rate risk, or equivalently, the expected return on default free bonds. This dependence, just as with the option pricing models pre-Black–Scholes–Merton, made their implementation problematic. Second, these models could not easily match the initial yield curve. This calibration is essential for the accurate pricing and hedging of interest rate derivatives because any discrepancies in yield curve matching may indicate \"false\" arbitrage opportunities in the priced derivatives.</p>",

The first model for studying credit risk, called the <i>structural approach</i>, was introduced by Merton [105]. Credit risk, although always an important consideration in fixed income markets, dramatically expanded its market wide recognition with the introduction of trading in credit default swaps after the mid-1990s. The reason for this delayed importance was that it took until then for the interest rate derivative markets to mature sufficiently for sophisticated financial institutions to successfully manage/hedge equity, foreign currency and interest rate risk. This risk-controlling ability enabled firms to seek out arbitrage opportunities, and in the process, lever up on the remaining financial risks, which are credit/counterparty, liquidity, and operational risk. This greater risk exposure by financial institutions to both credit and liquidity risk (as evidenced by the events surrounding the failure of Long Term Capital Management) spurred the more rapid development of credit risk modeling.</p>",
