The empirical relevance of the no arbitrage assumption is especially high in the area of financial markets for two simple reasons: there are many actors actively searching for arbitrage opportunities, and the exploitation of such opportunities is relatively costless. For finance, therefore, the principle of no arbitrage is not merely a convenient assumption that makes it possible to derive clean theoretical results but even more an idealization of observable empirical reality, and a characterization of the deep and simple structure underlying multifarious surface phenomena. For one whose habits of mind were initially shaped by the methods of natural science, specifically physics as taught by Richard Feynman (B.S. California Institute of Technology, 1965), finance seemed to be an area of economics where a truly scientific approach was possible.</p>",

If the apparently simple and eminently plausible assumption of no arbitrage could crack the problem of option pricing, perhaps it could crack other problems in finance as well. In short order, Ross produced what he later called the <i>fundamental theorem of asset</i> <i>pricing</i> [7, p. 101], which linked the absence of arbitrage with the existence of a positive linear pricing rule [12, 15] (<i>see</i> <b>Fundamental Theorem of Asset</b> <b>Pricing</b>).</p>",

This opened the possibility of creating new assets, such as options, that would in practical terms \"complete\" markets, and so help move the economy closer to the ideal efficient frontier characterized by Kenneth Arrow (<i>see</i> <b>Arrow,</b> <b>Kenneth</b>) as a complete set of markets for statecontingent securities [11].

It is this general feature that makes it possible to model option prices by treating the underlying stock price as a binomial random variable in discrete time, as first introduced by Cox <i>et al.</i> [6] in an approach that is now ubiquitous in industry practice.

For something as fundamental as the rate of interest, however, a general equilibrium model is to be preferred\" [1, p. 773]. They produce a general equilibrium model driven by a <i>k</i>-dimensional vector of state variables, but are forced to specialize the model considerably in order to achieve definite results for the dynamics of interest rates and the term structure. Here, more than anywhere else in Ross's wide-ranging work, we see the tension between the methodologies of economics and finance. It is this experience, one supposes, that lies behind his subsequent defense of the \"isolated and eccentric tradition\" that is unique to finance [17, p. 34]. The tradition to which he refers is the practice of approaching financial questions from the perspective of no arbitrage, without the apparatus of utility and production functions and without demand and supply.</p>",
