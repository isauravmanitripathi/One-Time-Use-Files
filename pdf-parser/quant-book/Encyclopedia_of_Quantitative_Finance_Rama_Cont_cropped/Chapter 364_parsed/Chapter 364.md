# Volatility

Financial volatility is, loosely speaking, a measure of the variability of asset returns (see Stochastic Volatility Models). It has been known for a long time that volatility changes through time. Both  $ex$ post and ex ante volatility measures are in common use. The most well-known *ex post* measure is realized volatility (Rvol), while ex ante measures include those generated by the ARCH-type models and option-based numbers such as implied volatility (see Implied Volatility Surface) and the VIX. Reviews of this literature include, among others, [4, 12, 23, 36].

We focus here on high frequency  $ex$  post measures of volatility and models of volatility driven by Lévy processes. Throughout our discussion, we refer to a vector of price processes

$$Y_t = Y_0 + \int_0^t \mu_u \, \mathrm{d}u + \int_0^t \sigma_u \, \mathrm{d}W_u, \quad t \ge 0 \quad (1)$$

where  $W_t$  is Brownian motion and  $\mu_t$ ,  $\sigma_t$  are spot drift and volatility. We write  $\mathcal{F}_t$  as the continuous time record of the past  $Y_t$ . For simplicity of exposition, we ignore jumps in the price process.

### Ex post Measures

Itô's formula (see Itô's Formula) implies

$$\operatorname{Var}\left\{ \left( Y_{t} - Y_{0} - \int_{0}^{t} \mu_{u} \, \mathrm{d}u \right) | \mathcal{F}_{0} \right\}$$
$$= E\left\{ \int_{0}^{t} \sigma_{u} \sigma_{u}^{\prime} \, \mathrm{d}u | \mathcal{F}_{0} \right\}$$
$$= E\{ [Y, Y]_{t} | \mathcal{F}_{0} \} \tag{2}$$

linking together ex ante variance forecasts with ex *ante* forecasts of the quadratic variation  $[Y, Y]$  of Y. However, we can use high-frequency data to estimate the  $[Y, Y]_t$  process, which allows us to project this quantity into the future without an explicit model for the spot volatility matrix  $\sigma_t$ . This method of constructing forecasts of volatility through QV was developed by Andersen et al. [2] (see Realized Volatility and Multipower Variation).

There is active literature on estimating the  $[Y, Y]$ process. Most of it deals with estimating discrete increments of the process over specified time periods, such as a day,  $IV_i = [Y, Y]_i - [Y, Y]_{i-1}$ . The most familiar estimator is the realized variance (RV), for the  $i$ th day, which is

$$RV_{i} = \sum_{i-1 < t_{j} \leq i} (Y_{t_{j}} - Y_{t_{j-1}})(Y_{t_{j}} - Y_{t_{j-1}})' \qquad (3)$$

where  $t_i$  are the times at which data is available—which could represent the times of trades and quotes (or a subset of such trades and quotes). In the univariate case, the square root of RV is the realized volatility. Many option contracts are directly written on Rvol and RV, but usually this is where volatility is measured over the month and daily returns are used in equation  $(3)$ .

The econometric theory associated with RV uses an in-fill asymptotic analysis, imagining  $t_i$  –  $t_{i-1} \downarrow 0$ . This is somewhat problematic as equation (1) ignores market microstructure effects (see Mar**ket Microstructure Effects**) which bite in the limit. However, for the moment we ignore this. Then,  $RV_i \stackrel{p}{\rightarrow} IV_i$  by the definition of QV. The central limit theory extension of this, in the univariate case, is

$$\widehat{V}_i^{-1/2} \sqrt{n} (RV_i - IV_i) \stackrel{d}{\to} N(0, 1) \tag{4}$$

and was developed by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard [11] (who suggested a variety of  $\widehat{V}_i$  quantities). See also [28, 31, 32]. Figure 1 illustrates this (together with results from another estimator discussed below), showing 95% confidence intervals using 20-min returns for General Electric, based on trades made on the stock exchange in November 2004.

Zhou [41] was the first to formally study the properties of RV-type statistics in the presence of market microstructure noise—which causes returns to be autocorrelated in time. Here, we think of noise as  $U = X - Y$ , where X is the observed trade or quote process and  $Y$  continues to be the underlying efficient price. Modern research has developed three methods for being robust to noise: preaveraging, [29] multiscale [40] and [39], and realized kernels [6, 7].

We focus on realized kernels, which generalize RV to

$$K(X) = \sum_{h=-H}^{H} k\left(\frac{h}{H+1}\right)\gamma_h, \quad \gamma_h = \sum_{j=|h|+1}^{n} r_j r_{j-|h|}$$

Figure 1 Daily estimates of *ex post* variability: RV and realized kernel, together with 95% confidence intervals

where  $\{r_i\}$  are high-frequency data and k is a Parzen weight function:

$$k(x) = \begin{cases} 1 - 6x^2 + 6x^3, & 0 \le x \le 1/2\\ 2(1 - x)^3, & 1/2 \le x \le 1\\ 0, & x > 1 \end{cases} \tag{6}$$

This is like an HAC estimator, which is popular in econometrics, but there is no scaling by sample size. It is robust to (i) irregularly spaced data, (ii) endogenous noise, and (iii) autocorrelation in the noise. A key feature of realized kernels is the choice of the bandwidth  $H$ . The value that approximately minimizes the asymptotic MSE of the estimator is  $H = 0.97\xi^{4/5}n^{3/5}, \xi^2 = \text{Var}(X - Y)/IV$ . Figure 1 illustrates the use of this method, which shows the improvement from using the high-frequency data. More details on how to implement this method are given in [8]. The multivariate implementation is discussed in  $[7]$ .

These high-frequency-data-based volatility measures can be combined to make volatility forecasts in a variety of ways. Andersen *et al.*  $[1-3]$  have pioneered the use of simple linear time-series methods. An alternative is to use lagged RV measures as an explanatory variable in the volatility dynamics of an ARCH model [24].

A wide variety of diffusion-based models of volatility have been proposed (*see* **Stochastic Volatil**ity Models; Local Volatility Model; Heston Model). The leading examples of these are the models proposed by Heston [25, 27, 35], while an interesting analysis of such models is found in  $[22, 30]$ .

#### **Pure Jump-based Volatility Models**

There is now quite a lot of evidence that there are jumps in the volatility process [38] and that jumps play a key role in generating statistical leverage effects [9]. An article that is a distinct break from the traditional diffusion-based stochastic volatility models associated with [27] is that of Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard [10]. In their simplest model, these authors wrote the univariate spot variance as an OU-type process (see Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes)

$$\mathrm{d}\sigma_t^2 = -\lambda \sigma_t^2 \,\mathrm{d}t + \mathrm{d}Z_{\lambda t}, \quad \lambda > 0 \tag{7}$$

where  $Z$  is a subordinator. It may be recalled that a subordinator is a Lévy process with nonnegative increments, which means  $\sigma_t^2$  has no Brownian component at all (see Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (BNS) Models). They have the feature that if  $\text{Var}(Z_1) < \infty$ , then  $\text{Corr}(\sigma_t^2, \sigma_{t+s}^2) = \exp(-\lambda s)$ .

A main advantage of this OU process is that

$$\sigma_t^2 = e^{-\lambda t} \sigma_0^2 + \int_0^t e^{-\lambda(t-s)} dZ_{\lambda s} \tag{8}$$

and

$$\int_{0}^{t} \sigma_{u}^{2} du = \lambda^{-1} (1 - e^{-\lambda t}) \sigma_{0}^{2}$$
$$+ \lambda^{-1} \int_{0}^{t} \{1 - e^{-\lambda(t-s)}\} dZ_{\lambda s} \quad (9)$$

Hence they are easy to analyze and simulate from.

More sophisticated dynamics can be achieved by adding together independent OU processes, each with a different decay parameter  $\lambda$ . Such superposition processes can be extended to the case of an infinite number of components, as analyzed by Barndorff-Nielsen [5].

A different route is to generate ARMA-type dynamics. Such processes have been advocated by Brockwell [19, 20, 37].

The OU process has been extended to the multivariate case by Barndorff-Nielsen and Stelzer [13] and [34]. They set up an OU process for the positive semidefinite covariance matrix  $\Sigma_t = \sigma_t \sigma'_t$  and analyzed the properties of the resulting implied multivariate return process.

These BNS models have been used extensively in applications. Derivative pricing on the basis of this type of model was first discussed by Nicolato and Venardos [33]. Subsequent research includes [14]. Benth *et al.* [15] studied the pricing of the variance and volatility swaps based on the BNS model. Minimal martingale measures for BNS models are analyzed by Benth and Meyer-Brandis [18, 26]. Benth *et al.* [16] studied the calculation of Greeks for BNS-type models.

Benth *et al.* and Delong and Klüppelberg [17, 21] have used BNS models to provide analytic solutions to the portfolio allocation problem.

These models and variants based on them have been used as the models of prices traded in energy markets, where extreme movements are quite common (see **Electricity Markets**).
