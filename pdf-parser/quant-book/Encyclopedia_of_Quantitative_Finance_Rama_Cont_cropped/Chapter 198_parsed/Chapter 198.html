    Reduced-form credit risk models
   </b>
   have become standard tools for pricing credit derivatives and for providing a link between credit spreads and default probabilities. In structural models, following the Merton approach [1, 12], default is defined by a firm value hitting a certain barrier. In such an approach, the concept of credit spread is rather abstract since it is not modeled explicitly and therefore is not directly accessible and may also have dynamics that are not completely pleasing. Reduced-form models, however, concentrate on modeling the hazard rate or intensity of default, which is directly linked to the credit spread process. In contrast to a structural approach, the event of default in a reduced-form model comes about as a sudden unanticipated event (although the likelihood of this event may have been changing).

   credit risk and hence we base most of our analysis around CDS pricing. Standard assumptions used in pricing CDS include deterministic default probabilities, interest rates, and recovery values (or at least independence between these three quantities). In a CDS contract, the protection buyer will typically pay a fixed periodic premium,
   <i>
    X
   </i>
   CDS, to the protection seller until the maturity date or the default (credit event) time (
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   ). The present value of these premiums at time
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   can be written as
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    V_{\text{premium}}(t, T) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} S(t, t_i) B(t, t_i) \Delta_{i-1,i} X_{\text{CDS}} \quad (3)

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Note that due to the required negative slope of
   <i>

   <i>
    Defining the Hazard Rate
   </i>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   In pricing a CDS, the main issue is to define
   <i>
    S(t, u)
   </i>
   for all relevant times in the future,
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   ≤
   <i>
    u
   </i>
   ≤
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   . If we consider default to be a Poisson process driven by a constant intensity of default, then the survival probability is
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    S(t, u) = \exp[-h(u - t)] \tag{5}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where
   <i>
    h
   </i>
   is the intensity of default, often described as the hazard rate. We can interpret
   <i>
    h
   </i>
   as a forward instantaneous default probability; the probability of default in a small period d
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   conditional on no prior default is
   <i>
    h
   </i>
   d
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   . Default is a sudden unanticipated event (although it may, of course, have been partly anticipated due to a high value of
   <i>
    h
   </i>
   ).

   If we assume that CDS premiums are paid continuously,a then the value of the premium

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Under the assumption of a constant hazard rate of default, we can write d

   The CDS spread will be such that the total value of these components is zero. Hence from

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The above close relationship between the hazard rate and CDS premium (credit spread) is important in that the underlying variable in our model is directly linked to credit spreads observed in the market. This is a key advantage over structural models whose underlying variables are rather abstract and hard to observe.

    Incorporating Term Structure

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   To allow for a term structure of credit (e.g., CDS premia at different maturities) and indeed a term structure of interest rates, we must choose some functional form for
   <i>
    h
   </i>
   . Such an approach is the credit equivalent of yield curve stripping, although due to the illiquidity of credit spreads much less refined, and was first suggested by Li [10]. The single-name CDS market is mainly based around 5-year instruments and other maturities will be rather illiquid. A standard approach is to choose a piecewise constant representation of the hazard rate to coincide with the maturity dates of the individual CDS quotes.

    Bonds and Basis Issues

  <p block-type="Text">
   Within a reduced-form framework, bonds can be priced in a similar way to CDS:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    V_{\text{bond}}(t, T) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} S(t, t_i) B(t, t_i) \Delta_{i-1, i} X_{\text{bond}}

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The first term above is similar to the default payment on a CDS but the assumption here is that the bond will be worth a fraction
   <i>
    δ
   </i>
   in default. The second and third terms represent the coupon and principal payments on the bond, respectively. It is therefore possible to price bonds
   <i>
    via
   </i>
   the CDS market (or
   <i>
    vice versa
   </i>
   ) and indeed to calibrate a credit curve
   <i>
    via
   </i>
   bonds of different maturities from the same issuer. However, the treatment of bonds and CDS within the same modeling framework must be done with caution. Components such as funding, the CDS delivery option, delivery squeezes, and counterparty risk mean that CDS and bonds of the same issuer will trade with a basis representing nonequal riskneutral default probabilities. In the context of the
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">

    Stochastic Default Intensity

  <p block-type="Text">
   The deterministic reduced-form approach can be extended to accommodate stochastic hazard rates and leads to the following expression for survival probabilities:-
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    S(t, u) = E^{\mathcal{Q}} \left[ \exp \left[ - \int_{t}^{u} h(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \right] \right] \tag{12}

  <p block-type="Text">
   This has led to various specifications for modeling a hazard rate process with parallels with interest-rate models for modeling products sensitive to credit spread volatility with examples to be found in [4, 5, 11]. Jarrow
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [7] (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Jarrow–Lando–Turnbull Model
   </b>
   ) have extended such an approach to have a Markovian structure to model credit migration or discrete changes in credit quality that would lead to jump in the credit spread. Furthermore, credit hybrid models with hazard rates correlated to other market variables, such as interest rates, have been introduced. For example, see [13].

   <i>
    Portfolio Approaches
   </i>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The first attempts at modeling portfolio credit products, such as basket default swaps and CDOs, involved multidimensional hazard rate models. However, it was soon realized that introducing the level of default correlation required to price such products realistically was far from trivial. This point is easily understood by considering that two perfectly correlated hazard rates will not produce perfectly correlated default events and more complex dynamics are required such as those considered by Duffie [3]. Most portfolio credit models have instead followed structural approaches (commonly referred to as
   <i>
    copula models
   </i>
   with the so-called Gaussian copula model becoming the market standard for pricing CDOs;
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Gaussian Copula Model
   </b>
   ) for reasons of simplicity. Schonbucher and Schubert [14] have shown how to combine intensity and copula models. More recently, the search for
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   more sophisticated portfolio credit risk modeling approaches is largely based around reduced-form models as in [2] and [6] (

    Conclusions

  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We have outlined the specification and usage of reduced-form models for modeling a default process and described the link between the underlying in such a model and market observed credit spreads. We have described the application of such models to vanilla credit derivative structures such as CDS and also more sophisticated structures such as credit spread options, credit hybrid instrument, and portfolio credit products.

   CDS premiums are typically paid quarterly in arrears but an accrued premium is paid in the event of default to compensate the protection seller for the period for which a premium has been paid. Hence the continuous premium assumption is only a mild approximation.
