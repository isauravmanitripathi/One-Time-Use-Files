He invented original strategies for the game of blackjack that revolutionized the game. Together with Sheen Kassouf, he showed how warrants could be hedged using a short position in the underlying stocks and described and implemented arbitrage portfolios of stocks and warrants. Thorp made other important contributions to the development of option pricing and to investment theory and practice. He has had a very successful record as an investment manager. This note contains a brief account of some of his major contributions.</p>",

While at MIT, he collaborated with Claude Shannon, and together they developed strategies for improving the odds at roulette and blackjack. One of their inventions was a wearable computer that was the size of modern-day cell phone. In 1962, Thorp [3] published <i>Beat the Dealer: A Winning Strategy for</i> <i>the Game of Twenty One</i>. This book had a profound impact on the game of blackjack as gamblers tried to implement his methods, and casinos responded with various countermeasures that were sometimes less than gentle.</p>",
