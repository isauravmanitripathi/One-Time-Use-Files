   Implied Volatility: Market Models
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The market model approach for implied volatility consists in taking implied volatilities as the quantities one wishes to model. In many options exchanges and over-the-counter markets, implied volatility is the way an option is quoted and hence plays the role of a price.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The market model approach for implied volatilities is inspired by the corresponding market model approach for interest rates, the so-called Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) approach to interest rate modeling (see Heath-Jarrow-Morton Approach). In interest rate modeling, it is simple to characterize the dynamics of the entire family of instantaneous forward rates in such a way that the corresponding family of bond prices is arbitrage free. It is also simple to give examples of such dynamics and to price interest rate sensitive contingent claims in such models.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Correspondingly, the market model approach to implied volatility seeks to characterize the dynamics of the entire implied volatility surface in such a way that the corresponding family of option prices is arbitrage free. It also seeks simple examples of such dynamics and ideally practical means of computing prices of exotic options on the underlying in such models.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Despite numerous attempts and recent progress in this area, it is fair to say that this approach has unfortunately not delivered the same elegant and useful results as the HJM approach has in interest rate modeling. The market approach to implied volatility can be traced back to the works [11, 12, 20].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As in the HJM approach, the no-arbitrage condition for implied volatilities takes the form of a drift restriction. In other words, the drift must be constrained for option prices to be local martingales under the pricing measure.

   has interesting properties. In particular, when we consider the infinite system of equation

   should not blow up too fast near expiry. It is called

   . In other words, the current value of the spot volatility can be exactly recovered from the implied volatility smile. This very much parallels the fact that the instantaneous forward rate with infinitely small tenor is the short rate in the HJM approach to interest rates.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   It is shown in [14] that the relation
   <math display="inline">
    \Sigma_t(t, S_t) = |\boldsymbol{\sigma}_t|

   Practitioners [10] have proposed two simple models for implied volatility surfaces movements: the sticky strike model and the sticky delta model. The sticky strike model supposes that between date s and

   In a sticky strike model, an option with a given strike has constant implied volatility. This contrasts with a sticky delta model where options with same moneyness have same implied volatilities. In other words, the implied volatility surface moves in perfect sync with the spot. In reality, implied volatilities move in a more complicated fashion but these two extreme cases are useful stylized benchmarks.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The sticky strike and sticky delta models, in fact, imply strong restrictions on the possible spot dynamics. Balland [2] showed that a sticky delta occurs if and only if the underlying asset price is the exponential of a process with independent increments (i.e., a Lévy process,
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Exponential Lévy Models

   ) under the pricing measure, and that a sticky strike situation occurs in the Black-Scholes model only!

    Empirical Models

  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   To overcome the obvious shortcomings of the sticky strike and sticky delta models, Cont and da Fonseca [9] have proposed to write down a model for the future evolution of the surface as an infinite system where each point of the surface is driven by a few common factors. These dynamics allow for easy calibration using principal component analysis [9] and can be useful for risk management and scenarios simulation. It is difficult, however, to check whether such specifications satisfy arbitrage restrictions, which prevents them from being used to price exotic options.

  <h4>
   <b>
    Other Approaches
   </b>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Modeling implied volatilities is equivalent to modeling option prices; as seen in equation (3), it is merely a parameterization of the options' volatilities. The difficulties in modeling implied volatilities have led researchers to look for other and possibly more tractable parameterizations. We mention them here, although these approaches depart from the strict study of implied volatilities.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   First, following a program started in
   <math display="inline">
    [7, 10]
   </math>
   model option prices by modeling Dupire local volatility as a random field. They are able to find explicit drift conditions as well as some examples of such dynamics. The Dupire local volatility surface also specifies the spot volatility in the short maturity limit but does not have complicated static arbitrage restrictions like equations
   <math display="inline">
    8-10
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Another way of parameterizing option prices consists in modeling its intrinsic value, that is, the difference between the option price and the payoff if the option was exercised today. This is the approach taken by
   <math display="inline">
    [15]
   </math>
   in a very general semimartingale framework. Exactly as with implied volatilities, this approach yields a spot specification when options are close to maturity.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Finally, let us mention the recent work [18], where the authors introduce new quantities: the "local implied volatilities" and "price level" to parameterize option prices. These have nicer dynamics and naturally satisfy the static arbitrage conditions. They derive existence results for the infinite system of equations driving these quantities.
