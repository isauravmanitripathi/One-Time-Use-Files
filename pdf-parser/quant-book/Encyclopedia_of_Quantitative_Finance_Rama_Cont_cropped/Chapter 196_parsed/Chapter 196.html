    Duffie-Singleton Model
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The credit risk modeling approach of Duffie and Singleton [8, 9] falls into the class of reducedform (see Reduced Form Credit Risk Models: Intensity-based Credit Risk Models) or intensitybased models in the sense that default is directly modeled as being triggered by a point process, as opposed to structural models (see Structural Default Risk Models) attempting to explain default through the dynamics of the firm's capital structure, and the intensity of this process under a risk-neutral probability measure is related to an appropriately defined instantaneous credit spread. In its original construction, it is set out as an econometric model, that is, a model the parameters of which are estimated from the time series of market data, such as the weekly data of swap yields used in [8]. To this end, the model is driven by a set of state variables following a Markov process under the risk-neutral measure, and defaultable zero-coupon bond prices are exponentially affine functions of the state variables along the lines of the results derived by Duffie and Kan [6] for default-free models of the term structure of interest rates (see Affine Models). Duffie and Singleton [9] show that the model framework can be made specific in a way that also allows default intensities and default-free interest rates to be negatively correlated in a manner that is more consistent theoretically than in prior attempts in the literature.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   A key assumption of Duffie-Singleton is the modeling of recovery in the event of default as an exogenously given fraction of the market value of the defaultable claim immediately prior to default. Under this assumption, the possibility of default on a claim can be priced by default-adjusting the interest rate with which the future cash flow (or payoff) from the claim is discounted. That is to say that today's
   <math display="inline">
    (t = 0)

   value
   <math display="inline">
    V_0
   </math>
   of a claim with the (possibly random) payoff X at time
   <math display="inline">
    t = T

   <math display="inline">

   can be interpreted as a "risk-neutral mean-loss rate of the instrument due to default." As a consequence, credit spread data alone (be it corporate bond yields, swap to treasury spreads, or credit default swap spreads) are insufficient to separate the "risk-neutral mean-loss rate"

   . If the payoff of the claim is also Markovian in Y, say

   , then the value of the claim at any time

   The "recovery-of-market-value" assumption at the core of the Duffie-Singleton framework is in line with market practice for defaultable derivative financial instruments such as swaps. For defaultable bonds, it is arguably more realistic to model the loss in the event of default as a fraction of the par value. However, Duffie and Singleton [9] provide evidence that par yield spreads implied by reduced-form models are relatively robust with respect to different recovery assumptions, and suggest that for bonds trading substantially away from par, pricing differences due to different recovery assumptions can be largely compensated by changes in the recovery parameters. The computational tractability gained through the "recovery-of-market-value" assumption may thus

   is adjusted for default and liquidity. The assumption of exogenous default intensity and recovery rate can be lifted, as in [5], by allowing intensities/recovery rates to differ for the counterparties in an overthe-counter (OTC) derivative transaction, with the intensity/recovery rate relevant for discounting determined by which counterparty is in the money. Jumps in the default-adjusted rate can be introduced along the lines of [6] while preserving the tractability of an affine term structure model. The model of singleobligor default considered by Duffie and Singleton [8, 9] can also be extended to the portfolio level using the copula function approach of Schonbucher ¨ and Schubert [11], since introducing default correlation through correlated diffusive dynamics of the default intensities
   <i>
    ht
   </i>
   for different obligors is typically insufficient, resulting only in very mild correlation of defaults.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Historically, reduced-form models like Duffie– Singleton have been considered to be following a different paradigm than the more fundamental structural models where default is triggered when the value of the firm falls below a barrier taken to represent the firm's liabilities. However, the two approaches have been reconciled by Duffie and Lando [7], who show that models based on a default intensity can be underpinned by a structural model in which bondholders are imperfectly informed about the firm's value.
