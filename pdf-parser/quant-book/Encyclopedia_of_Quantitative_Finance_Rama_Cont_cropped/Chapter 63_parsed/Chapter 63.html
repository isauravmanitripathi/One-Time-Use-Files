   Risk premia are the expected excess returns that compensate investors for taking on aggregate risk. The first section of this article defines risk premia analytically. The second section surveys empirical evidence on equity, bond, and currency excess returns. The third section reviews the models that explain these risk premia.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Risk premia are derived analytically from Euler equations that link returns to stochastic discount factors (SDFs). These Euler equations can be derived under three different assumptions: complete markets. the law of one price, or the existence of investors' preferences. These three assumptions are reviewed here, followed by the analytical definition of risk premia.

   To gain some intuition on the definition above. let us consider the case of preference-based SDFs. Assume that utility increases, and marginal utility decreases with consumption; this is the consumptioncapital asset pricing model (consumption-CAPM). Here, the SDF—also known as

   Marginal utility

Our assumption on the investors' utility function implies that investors dislike uncertainty about consumption. An asset whose return covaries positively with consumption pays off well when the investor is already feeling wealthy and it pays off badly when he/she is already feeling poor. Thus, such an asset will make the investor's consumption stream more volatile. As a result, assets whose returns covary positively with consumption make consumption more volatile, and so must promise higher expected returns to induce investors to hold them.

   Aggregate nondurable and services consumption growth has a mean of 2% and a standard deviation of 1%, implying a risk-aversion coefficient of 40! If we take into account the low correlation between consumption growth rates and market returns, the implied risk aversion is even higher. This is the equity premium puzzle of Mehra and Prescott [16]. Such a high risk-aversion coefficient implies implausibly high risk-free rates. This is the risk-free rate puzzle of Weil [19].

   We have seen that the aggregate stock market offers evidence of sizable and time-varying risk premia. Many subsets of the market offer comparable results. For example, Fama and French [12] sort stocks along different dimensions (e.g., their market size, book-to-market ratios, or past returns), build the corresponding portfolios and obtain large cross sections of returns. Buying the stocks in the last portfolio and selling the ones in the first portfolio lead to large and predictable excess returns, and thus evidence of equity risk premia.

  <h4>
   Currency Markets
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Risk premia are also prevalent on currency markets. Currency excess returns correspond to the following investment strategy: borrowing in the domestic currency, exchanging this amount for some foreign currency, lending abroad, and converting back the earnings into the domestic currency. According to the standard uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) condition, the expected change in exchange rate should be equal to the interest rate differential between foreign
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   and domestic risk-free bonds. In this case, expected currency excess returns should be zero. However, the UIP condition is clearly rejected in the data. In a simple regression of exchange rate changes on interest rate differentials, UIP predicts a slope coefficient of 1. Instead, empirical work following Hansen and Hodrick [13] and Fama [11] consistently reveals a regression coefficient that is smaller than 1 and very often negative. The international economics literature refers to these negative UIP slope coefficients as the UIP puzzle or forward premium anomaly. Negative slope coefficients mean that currencies with higher than average interest rates actually tend to appreciate. Investors in foreign one-period discount bonds thus earn the interest rate spread, which is known at the time of their investment, plus the bonus from the appreciation of the currency during the holding period. As a result, the failure of the UIP condition implies positive predictable excess returns when investing in high interest rate currencies and negative excess returns for investing in low interest rate currencies. Lustig and Verdelhan [15] build portfolios of currency excess returns by sorting currencies on their interest rate differentials with the United States. They obtain a large cross section of currency excess returns and show that these excess returns compensate the US investor for bearing US aggregate macroeconomic risk because high interest rate currencies tend to depreciate in bad times. As a result, currency excess returns are also evidence of risk premia.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   To summarize this section, equity, bond, and currency markets offer predictable excess returns, and are thus characterized by risk premia. Now the potential theoretical explanations of these risk premia are discussed.

A large literature seeks to address these shortcomings and offers different interpretations of the observed risk premia. Now the three most

   successful classes of models in this literature, namely, habit preferences, long-run risk, and disaster risk, are reviewed.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Habit preferences assume that the agent does not care about the absolute level of his/her consumption, but cares about its relative level compared to a habit level that can be interpreted as a subsistence level, past consumption, or the neighbors' consumption. Hence, preferences over habits

   . Major examples of habit preferences are found in Abel [1], Campbell and Cochrane [4], Constantinides [8] and Sundaresan [18]. Preferences defined using differences between consumption and habit (e.g.,

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Campbell and Cochrane [4] propose a model along these lines. In their model, the habit level is slow moving; in bad times, consumption falls close to the habit level, and the investor is very risk averse. This model offers a new interpretation to risk premia: investors fear bad returns and wealth loss because they tend to happen in recessions, when consumption falls relative to its recent past. These preferences generate many interesting asset pricing features: pro-cyclical variations of stock prices, long-horizon predictability, countercyclical variation of stock market volatility, countercyclicality of the Sharpe ratio, and the short- and long-run equity premium.

   <i>
    Long-run Risk
   </i>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The long-run risk literature works off the class of preferences due to Epstein and Zin [9, 10] and Kreps and Porteus [14]. These preferences impute a concern for the timing of the resolution of uncertainty to agents, and the risk-aversion coefficient is no longer the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution as it is with the consumption-CAPM (

  <p block-type="Text">
   Bansal and Yaron [2] propose a model where the consumption and dividend growth processes contain a low-frequency component and are heteroscedastic. These two features capture time-varying growth rates and time-varying economic uncertainty. Because this low-frequency component is persistent, a high value today signals high expected consumption growth in the future. If the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is above 1, then, in response to higher expected growth, agents buy more assets, and the price to consumption ratio rises: the intertemporal substitution effect dominates the wealth effect. In this case, asset prices are high in good times and low in bad times; thus, investors require risk premia. In this model, agents have preference for early resolution of uncertainty, which increases the risk compensation for long-run growth and uncertainty risks.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Disaster Risk
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In the disaster risk literature, the agent is characterized by the usual constant relative risk-aversion preferences. Rietz [17] assumes that in each period a small-probability disaster may occur, and in this case, consumption and dividends drop sharply. Barro [3] calibrates disaster probabilities from the twentieth-century global history and shows that they are consistent with the high equity premium, low riskfree rate, and volatile stock returns. In this model, risk premia exist because investors fear rare economic disasters.
  </p>
  <h1>
   Conclusion
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Under a minimal set of assumptions, any return satisfies a simple Euler equation. This equation implies that expected returns in excess of the risk-free rate, that is, risk premia, exist because returns comove with aggregate factors that matter for the investor. Empirical evidence from the equity, bond, and currency markets points to large and time-varying predictable excess returns. A recent literature tries to replicate and interpret these risk premia as compensations for recession, long-run, or disaster risks.
