    Counterparty Credit Riska
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Counterparty credit risk (CCR) is the risk that a counterparty in a financial contract will default prior to the expiration of the contract and will fail to make all the payments required by the contract. Only the contracts privately negotiated between the counterparties—over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities financing transactions (SFT)—bear CCR. Exchange-traded derivatives are not subject to CCR because all contractual payments promised by these derivatives are guaranteed by the exchange.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   CCR is similar to other forms of credit risk (such as lending risk) in that the source of economic loss is an obligor's default. However, CCR has two unique features that set it apart from lending risk:

  <p block-type="ListGroup">
   <ul>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     <b>
      Uncertainty of credit exposure
     </b>
     Credit exposure of one counterparty to the other is determined by the market value of all the contracts between these counterparties. While one can obtain the current exposure from the current contract values, the future exposure is uncertain because the future contract values are not known at present.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     <b>
      Bilateral nature of credit exposure
     </b>
     Since both counterparties can default and the value of many financial contracts (such as swaps) can change sign, the direction of future credit exposure is uncertain. Counterparty A may be exposed to default of counterparty B under one set of future market scenarios, while counterparty B may be exposed to default of counterparty A under another set of scenarios.
    </li>
   </ul>

   The uncertainty of future credit exposure makes managing and modeling CCR of the trading book challenging. For a comprehensive introduction to CCR, see [1, 5, 17].

    Managing and Mitigating Counterparty Credit Risk
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   One of the most conventional techniques of managing credit risk is setting counterparty-level
   <i>
    credit limits
   </i>
   . If a new transaction with the counterparty would result in the counterparty-level exposure exceeding
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   the limit, the transaction is not allowed. The limits usually depend on the counterparty's credit quality: higher rated counterparties have higher limits. To compare uncertain future exposure with a deterministic limit,
   <i>
    potential future exposure
   </i>
   (PFE) profiles are calculated from exposure probability distributions at future time points. PFE profiles are obtained by calculating a quantile of exposure at a high confidence level (typically, above 90%). Some institutions use different exposure measures, such as
   <i>
    expected exposure
   </i>
   (EE) profiles, for comparing with the credit limit. It is important to understand that a given credit limit amount is meaningful only in the context of a given exposure measure (e.g., 95%-level quantile).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Future credit exposure can be greatly reduced by means of risk-mitigating agreements between two counterparties, which include
   <i>
    netting agreements, margin agreements
   </i>
   , and
   <i>
    early termination agreements
   </i>
   . Netting agreement is a legally binding contract between two counterparties that, in the event of default of one of them, allows aggregation of transactions between these counterparties. Instead of each trade between the counterparties being settled separately, the entire portfolio covered by the netting agreement is settled as a single trade whose value equals the net value of the portfolio. Margin agreements limit the potential exposure of one counterparty to the other by means of requiring collateral should the unsecured exposure exceed a predefined threshold. The threshold value depends primarily on the credit quality of the counterparty: the higher the credit quality, the higher the threshold.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   There are two types of early termination agreements:
   <i>
    termination clauses
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    downgrade provisions
   </i>
   . Termination clause is specified at the trade level. A unilateral (bilateral) termination clause gives one (both) of the counterparties the right to terminate the trade at the fair market value at a predefined set of dates. Downgrade provision is specified for the entire portfolio between two counterparties. Under a unilateral (bilateral) downgrade provision, the portfolio is settled at its fair market value the first time the credit rating of one (either) of the counterparties falls below a predefined level.

   contract with a counterparty. The bank's
   <i>
    exposure
   </i>
   to the counterparty at a given future time is given by the bank's economic loss in the event of the counterparty's default at that time. If the counterparty defaults, the bank must close out its position with the counterparty. To determine the loss arising from the counterparty's default, it is convenient to assume that the bank enters into a similar contract with another counterparty in order to maintain its market position. Since the bank's market position is unchanged after replacing the contract, the loss is determined by the contract's
   <i>
    replacement cost
   </i>
   at the time of default.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   If the trade value at the time of default is negative for the bank, the bank receives this amount when it replaces the trade, but has to forward the money to the defaulting counterparty, so that the net loss is zero. If the trade value at the time of default is positive for the bank, the bank pays this amount when replacing the trade, but receives nothing (assuming no recovery) from the defaulting counterparty, so that the net loss is equal to the trade value.

    Margin Agreements and Collateral Modeling

   Margin agreements can further reduce credit exposure. Margin agreements can be either
   <i>
    unilateral
   </i>
   or
   <i>

   . Under a unilateral agreement, only one of the counterparties has to post collateral. If the agreement is bilateral, both counterparties have to post collateral.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Usually a margin agreement covers one or more netting agreements. We can generalize equation (3) by specifying collateral amount

  <h4>
   <i>
    Unilateral Margin Agreements

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Let us consider a single unilateral (in the bank's favor) margin agreement with the threshold
   <i>
    H
   </i>
   <sup>
    c
   </sup>
   ≥ 0
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   and minimum transfer amount (MTA). When the portfolio value exceeds the threshold, the counterparty must post collateral to keep the bank's exposure from rising above the threshold. As the exposure drops below the threshold, the bank returns collateral to the counterparty. MTA limits the frequency of collateral exchange. It is difficult to model collateral subject to MTA exactly because that would require daily simulation time points, which is not feasible given the long-term nature of exposure modeling. In practice, the actual threshold
   <math display="inline">
    H_c
   </math>
   is often replaced by the effective threshold defined as
   <math display="inline">
    H_c^{(e)} = H_c +
   </math>
   MTA. After this replacement, the margin agreement is treated as if it had zero MTA.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The simplest approach to modeling collateral is to limit the future exposure from above by the threshold (i.e., for all scenarios with portfolio value above the threshold, set the exposure equal to the threshold). However, this approach is too simplistic because it ignores the time lag between the last delivery of collateral and the time when the loss is realized. This time lag is known as the
   <i>
    margin period of risk

   (
   <i>
    MPR

   ), which we will denote by
   <math display="inline">
    \delta t

   weeks is usually assumed for portfolios of liquid contracts and daily margin call frequency.

    Bilateral Margin Agreements

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Under a bilateral margin agreement, both the counterparty and the bank have to post collateral: the counterparty posts collateral when the bank's exposure to the counterparty exceeds the counterparty's threshold, while the bank posts collateral when the counterparty's exposure to the bank exceeds the bank's threshold. Since we are doing our analysis from the point of view of the bank, we will keep

   . Then, the bank posts collateral when the portfolio value (defined from the bank's point of view) is

   Until now we have discussed modeling credit exposure and losses at the counterparty level.

   However, the joint simulation process is very expensive computationally and is often replaced by
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   a simplified approach, where simulation of counterparty defaults is completely separate from exposure simulation. The simplified approach is a two-stage process. During the first stage, exposure simulation is performed and a deterministic loan equivalent exposure (LEQ) is calculated from the exposure distribution for each counterparty. The second stage is a simulation of counterparty default events according to one of the credit risk portfolio models (see
   <b>
    Credit

   Migration Models; Structural Default Risk Models;

  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Note that many loan portfolio models do not produce the time of default explicitly. Instead, they only distinguish between two events: "default has happened prior to the horizon (i.e.,
   <math display="inline">
    \tau_i \leq T
   </math>
   )" and "default has not happened prior to the horizon (i.e.,

   For an infinitely fine-grained portfolio with independent exposures, it has been shown
   <math display="inline">
    [6, 20]

   for a real portfolio, the EC will be understated because both exposure volatility and correlation between exposures are ignored. However, this understated EC can be used in defining a scaling parameter commonly known as

    alpha

   :
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">

   is the EC of the fictitious portfolio with stochastic exposures replaced by EPE.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Because the EC of a portfolio with deterministic exposures is a homogeneous function of the exposures, using the LEQ defined in equation (21) will produce the correct EC

  <p block-type="Text">
   Several estimates of typical values of
   <i>
    alpha
   </i>
   for a large dealer portfolio and the time horizon
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   = 1 year are available. An International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) survey [11] has reported
   <i>
    alpha
   </i>
   calculated by four large banks for their actual portfolios to be in the 1.07–1.10 range. Theoretical estimates of
   <i>
    alpha

   under a set of simplifying assumptions [6, 20] are 1.1 when market-credit correlations are ignored, and 1.2 when they are not.

   The framework described above has found its place in the regulatory capital calculations under Basel II (

   <b>
    Regulatory Capital

   ): a slightly modified version of equation (21) is used to calculate exposure at default (EAD) under the internal models method for CCR [2]. Basel fixes
   <i>
    alpha

   at 1.4, but it allows banks to calculate their own
   <i>
    alpha
