   Universal Portfolios
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The mainstream mathematical approach to investment portfolio selection involves modeling asset prices as a stochastic process, and deriving asset allocation strategies that are optimal with respect to some statistical criteria, such as the mean and variance of returns, or an expected utility. The application of this approach to real-world markets is complicated by the lack of a fully specified stochastic process. It is, in fact, debatable whether an underlying stochastic process exists at all.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The theory of universal portfolios offers an alternative approach that forgoes stochastic models and associated optimality criteria and instead finds universal portfolio selection strategies that perform well relative to
   <i>
    all
   </i>
   strategies in a target class of allocation strategies, for all possible sequences of asset price changes. The term universal portfolio was coined in [3], which first put forth this alternative paradigm for the specific target class of constant rebalanced portfolios. This particular target class, which has also been the focus of much of the subsequent related work, seems to strike a favorable balance between the richness of the class and the degree to which the class performance can be tracked. The theory, in its greatest generality, however, can involve any target class, and would be concerned with finding the degree to which it can be tracked universally. The article focuses on universal portfolios for constant rebalanced portfolios, with only a brief mention of what is known beyond this.

   Constant rebalanced portfolios [14] are a wellknown (though under several aliases) class of allocation strategies that, at designated times, buy and sell assets to restore the fractions of wealth invested in each asset to an initial, fixed allocation. For a given sequence of rebalancing times, constant rebalanced portfolios can thus be parameterized by a vector with real valued, nonnegative components summing to one, specifying the fractions of wealth to which asset allocations are rebalanced. For example, given a pair of assets, the constant rebalanced portfolio corresponding to the vector
   <math display="inline">
    (1/3, 2/3)
   </math>
   initially invests
   <math display="inline">
    1/3
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    2/3
   </math>
   of starting capital, respectively, in each of the assets. Thereafter, as the asset prices change, it buys and sells the assets at each rebalancing time to restore the fractions of cumulative wealth invested in each asset back to the initial
   <math display="inline">
    (1/3, 2/3)
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   One well-known motivating property of constant rebalanced portfolios is that they maximize the expectation of a variety of utility functions when asset price returns between rebalancing times are statistically independent and identically distributed from one interval to the next. In general, the optimal allocation depends on both the underlying probability distribution and the utility function, making the optimal choice, from this point of view, a challenging one for any given real-world setting. The theory of universal portfolios for constant rebalanced portfolios, which seeks to perform well relative to all portfolios, offers a principled way around this difficulty. It is worth reemphasizing, however, that beyond this motivational aspect, the theory makes
   <math display="inline">
    no
   </math>
   stochastic assumptions on asset prices.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Given a fixed number of assets and a sequence of asset price changes between
   <math display="inline">
    n
   </math>
   -designated rebalancing times, let
   <math display="inline">
    S_n^*
   </math>
   denote the largest return attained by any constant rebalanced portfolio on that sequence of asset price changes. This will be the benchmark for universal portfolio performance. Note that
   <math display="inline">
    S_n^*
   </math>
   and the (best) constant rebalanced portfolio that achieves it depend on the entire sequence of asset price changes, whereas the allocations of any realizable portfolio selection strategy must be causal, or nonanticipating, depending only on the previously observed price data. As such, the return
   <math display="inline">
    S_n^*
   </math>
   is not directly realizable. Furthermore, depending on the actual asset returns,
   <math display="inline">
    S_n^*
   </math>
   may exceed the return of any fixed constant rebalanced portfolio by an exponentially increasing factor. This means that naively using a seemingly safe choice like the uniform allocation might be exponentially suboptimal.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Nonetheless, nonanticipating universal portfolios have been found with returns
   <math display="inline">
    \hat{S}_n
   </math>
   that approach
   <math display="inline">
    S_n^*
   </math>
   , in the sense that the exponential rates of return per rebalancing interval,
   <math display="inline">
    \hat{W}_n = (1/n) \log \hat{S}_n
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    W_n^* =
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    (1/n) \log \hat{S}_n^*
   </math>
   , are guaranteed to satisfy
   <math display="inline">
    \hat{W}_n - W_n^* \geq
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    -((m-1)/(2n))\log n - O(1/n)
   </math>
   , uniformly for all sequences of asset prices. Since this relative exponential rate of return tends to 0 in
   <math display="inline">
    n
   </math>
   , it follows that if
   <math display="inline">
    S_n^*
   </math>
   is increasing at some exponential rate of growth (as would be hoped for and expected in practice),
   <math display="inline">
    \hat{S}_n
   </math>
   will increase at the same exponential rate, asymptotically. The remainder of the article explains the universal portfolios achieving this benchmark performance.
