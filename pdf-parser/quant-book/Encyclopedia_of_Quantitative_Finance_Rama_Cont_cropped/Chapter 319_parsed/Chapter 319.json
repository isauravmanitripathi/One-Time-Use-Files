Bilateral contracting and traditional supplier management practices will remain essential elements of procurement management in the future. However, the growth of commodity exchanges, and derivative instruments defined on these, has introduced a fine-tuning mechanism that improves operational performance and simultaneously helps value longer term contractual, capacity, and technology decisions. The centerpiece of this new perspective is the integration of traditional forms of contracting with shorter term market-driven physical and financial transactions. This integration is the focus of this article.</p>",

Aluminum is an important element of the cost structure. For major buyers like Anheuser Busch, a restricted set of sellers is used to source aluminum, even though the aluminum spot market price is a key benchmark for sourcing and hedging, and is determined by the actions of scores of global players. Here, sourcing arrangements with main sellers are typically set according to the spot price plus processing costs, and contracts are marked to market on a daily basis. Second, there may be value-added services undertaken by these contractors to take aluminum ingots and prepare them in a more suitable fashion for can production, and again here this would be done only with specifications for these services worked out with a few sellers. However, the typical setup in metals is for a restricted set of contract sellers, with spot purchases and hedging used to benchmark prices and to \"top up\" contract purchases and hedge overall supply cash flows. The same general market and contracting structure operates in many other commodity markets, including energy and agricultural markets [5].</p>",

Assuming homogeneous sellers and instantaneous scalability (with no capacity limitations), they show that forward markets can yield inefficient outcomes because of strategic use of these markets by sellers with market power.

In the context of supply contracting, an additional distinction is required in the types of options involved, between purely financial options and those connected to physical delivery of a particular good at a particular time and place. The early discussion and literature was focused on physical delivery options to fulfill a buyer's sourcing needs. These options would entail delivery at a particular time and place (e.g., FOB Pittsburgh). In these markets, options backed by physical delivery are central to the buyer's problem of arranging for sufficient supply to meet the buyer's demand. However, once a functioning spot market exists, this market can be used to define financial options on the basis of the spot price.

We will take the simplest possible approach to the regulated sector, assuming a fixed, exogenously determined regulated price per Kilowatt hour, independent of time. More complicated regulatory scenarios are easily incorporated into the framework developed. This feature of customer demand at regulated prices, together with the weather-driven level of spot prices and the nonstorability of electric power, makes electricity supply a risky business.</p>",

Purchased forwards, which are prepaid, fixed obligations to deliver power, may be viewed as call options having a zero execution price that therefore will be executed by the Company on the day.

In the case where there are sufficient subperiods in <math display=\"inline\">T</math> to make the normality assumption reasonable for <math display=\"inline\">\\Pi(Q, \\tilde{D}, \\tilde{P}_s)</math>, this standard VaR constraint translates into a simple function of the mean and standard deviation of <math display=\"inline\">\\Pi(Q, \\tilde{D}, \\tilde{P}_s)</math>. Since the profit function is linear in <math display=\"inline\">Q_i</math> for every realization of the random variables involved, finding the efficient frontier (in <math display=\"inline\">E\\{\\Pi\\}</math>, VaR space) is then easily solved in the standard fashion via quadratic programming. Multiperiod VaR constraints are also discussed in [7]. For more complex problems that arise in practice, including sophisticated models of the evolution of the spot price and various exotic options, Monte Carlo simulation (see Monte Carlo Simulation) with an appropriate optimization engine can be used.</p>",
