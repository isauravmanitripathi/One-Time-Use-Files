  <p block-type="Text">
   Ouadratic Gaussian (OG) models are factor models for the pricing of interest-rate derivatives, where interest rates are quadratic functions of underlying Gaussian factors. The OG model of interest rates was first introduced by Beaglehole and Tenney [3] and by El Karoui
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [11]. Similar models had been introduced in epidemiology [16]. Jamshidian [14], under restrictive hypothesis on the dynamic of the factors, obtained closed formulas for the prices of vanilla options in the QG model. Durand and El Karoui [10] have detailed some properties and statistical analysis of the QG model. One may refer, for example, to

    Statistical Justification
   </b>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In addition to the practical and computational justification of the hypothesis that lead to the QG model, this model can also be justified by statistical studies of the interest rates. The most intuitive justification comes from principal component analysis (PCA). For most currencies, using a PCA will lead to keeping two factors to explain the diffusion of the interest yield curves. Then, the residual noise may be explained by a quadratic form of the first two factors of the PCA. For a detailed description of this analysis, we refer to [10].

  <h2>
   Pricing of Exotic Options
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   To use the QG model to price and hedge exotic options, one needs to add some constraints to simplify the different equations and to accelerate the different numerical schemes used in the different steps of calibrating the model on plain vanilla option prices and used to price exotic options. Some calibration results of a two-factor OG model on USD Libor caps and swaptions are shown in [2]. Depending on the shape of the smile and on the payoff of the exotic option studied, one uses a one- or two-factor model: empirically, by using a one-factor QG model one will generate increasing or decreasing volatility smiles; with a two-factor QG model, "U-shape" volatility smiles may be generated. The QG model can then be successfully calibrated on vanilla option prices and on interest-rate correlation to price and hedge exotic interest-rate options. We recommend to choose a calibration set for each exotic option and not to try to calibrate simultaneously to the entire volatility cube. We also recommend to specify a correlation structure

    Summary
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Owing to its capacity to calibrate interest-rate volatility smiles and correlation term structure, the QG is an interesting model to price and hedge exotic interest-rate derivatives, as multicancelable options on interest-rate spreads. Several banks have developed proprietary models based on the QG model, each choosing its own parameterization, mainly as a consequences of choices made on the numerical schemes used.
