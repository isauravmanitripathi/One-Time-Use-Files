   Robust Portfolio Optimization
  </h2>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Portfolio selection is the problem of allocating capital over a number of available assets in order to maximize the "return" on the investment while minimizing the "risk". Although the benefits of diversification in reducing risk have been appreciated since the inception of financial markets, Markowitz [25, 26] formulated the first mathematical model for portfolio selection. In the Markowitz portfolio selection model, the "return" on a portfolio is measured by the expected value of the random portfolio return, and the associated "risk" is quantified by the variance of the portfolio return. Markowitz showed that, given either an upper bound on the risk that the investor is willing to take or a lower bound on the return the investor is willing to accept, the optimal portfolio can be obtained by solving a convex quadratic programming problem. This mean-variance model has had a profound impact on the economic modeling of financial markets and the pricing of assets—the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) developed primarily by Sharpe [30], Lintner [22], and Mossin [28] was an immediate logical consequence of the Markowitz theory. In 1990, Sharpe and Markowitz shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their work on portfolio allocation and asset pricing.

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   In spite of the theoretical success of the mean-vari ance model, practitioners have shied away from this model. The following quote from Michaud [27] summarizes the problem: "Although Markowitz efficiency is a convenient and useful theoretical framework for portfolio optimality, in practice it is an error prone procedure that often results in
   <i>
    error-maximized
   </i>
   and investment-irrelevant portfolios." This behavior is a reflection of the fact that solutions of optimization problems are often very sensitive to perturbations in the parameters of the problem; since the estimates of the market parameters are subject to statistical errors, the results of the subsequent optimization are not very reliable. Various aspects of this phenomenon have been extensively studied in the literature on portfolio selection. Chopra and Ziemba [8] study the cashequivalent loss from the use of estimated parameters instead of the true parameters. Broadie [5] investigates the influence of errors on the efficient frontier
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   and Chopra [7] investigates the turnover in the composition of the optimal portfolio as a function of the estimation error (see also Part II of [31] for a summary of this research). Several studies have shown that imposing constraints on the portfolio weights in a mean-variance optimization problem leads to better out-of-sample performance [15, 16]. Practitioners have always imposed no short-sale constraints and/or bounds for each security to improve diversity. It is suggested that constraining portfolio weights may reduce volatility, increase realized efficiency, and decrease downside risk or shortfall probability. Jagannathan and Ma [19] provide theoretical justification for these observations. Michaud [27] suggests resampling the mean returns
   <math display="inline">
    \mu
   </math>
   and the covariance matrix
   <math display="inline">
    \Sigma
   </math>
   of the assets from a confidence region around a nominal set of parameters, and then aggregating the portfolios obtained by solving a Markowitz problem for each sample. Recently, scenario-based stochastic programming models have also been proposed for handling the uncertainty in parameters (see Part V of [31] for a survey of this research). Neither of the above two scenario based approaches provide any hard guarantees on the portfolio performance, and both become very inefficient as the number of assets grows.

   Robust optimization is a deterministic optimization framework in which one explicitly models the parameter uncertainty, and the optimization problems are solved assuming worst-case behavior of these perturbations. This robust optimization framework was introduced in [3] for linear programming and in [2] for general convex programming [4]. There is also a parallel literature on robust formulations of optimization problems originating from robust control [10, 12] and

   can be reformulated as a second-order cone program (SOCP) (see [23] or [29] for details). This fact has important theoretical and practical implications. Since the computational complexity of an SOCP is comparable to that of a convex quadratic program, it follows that robust active portfolio selection is able to provide protection against parameter fluctuations at very moderate computational cost. Moreover, a number of commercial solvers such as MOSEK, CPLEX, and Frontline System (supplier of EXCEL SOLVER) provide the capability for solving SOCPs in a numerically robust manner.

   The robust optimization methodology has also been extended to
   <i>
    active
   </i>
   portfolio management problems where the goal is to beat a given benchmark by using information that is not broadly available in the market. Since errors in estimating the returns of assets are expected to have serious consequences for an active strategy, robust models are likely to result in portfolios with significantly superior performance. Erdoğan et al. [14] show how the basic robust portfolio selection model extends to robust active portfolio management. Since active portfolio strategies tend to execute many trades, properly modeling and managing trading costs are essential for the success of any practical active portfolio management model [20, 24]. Erdoğan et al. [14] show that a very large class of piecewise convex trading cost functions can be incorporated into an active portfolio selection problem in a tractable manner. Ceria and Stubbs [6] show how to impose a variety of side constraints on the exceptional return
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha

   and still recast the portfolio selection problem as an SOCP. Erdogan et al. [13] show how to incorporate analysts' views about

    \alpha
   </math>
   and nonparametric loss functions into robust active portfolio management.
