    Static Hedging
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Liquid traded put and call options can be used as hedge instruments for over-the-counter traded products. Barrier options are the most common exotic options, and, for these contracts, static hedging works out particularly well. In the Black–Scholes model there are simple methods (conceptually straightforward and/or closed form) for constructing replicating portfolios that do not require dynamic trading; they are set up at initiation of the barrier option, and liquidated at either knockout or expiry. They are, thus, static hedges. Inspired by Allen and Padovani [1], we describe how to find static hedges for barrier options in the Black–Scholes model in a way that encompasses both Derman's [6] intuitive calendar-spread algorithm and Carr's [4] strike-spread hedges stemming from put–call symmetry.

   Unless we explicitly say otherwise, we consider a Black–Scholes model throughout this article. This means that the interest rate is constant, and all options are written on some underlying asset
   <i>
    S
   </i>
   that follows a geometric Brownian motion. A zero-rebate, knockout barrier option is a contract that pays off as a plain vanilla option if
   <i>
    S
   </i>
   stays within a specified barrier for the whole life of the barrier option, but becomes worthless if the barrier is hit or crossed (

   ). Recurrent examples are the downand-out call and the up-and-out call The value of a still-alive barrier option is of the form
   <i>
    F (St,t)
   </i>
   , where the function
   <i>
    F
   </i>
   solves the Black–Scholes partial differential equation with 0 as boundary condition along the barrier (

    Construction of Static Hedges
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   A portfolio of puts and calls that (approximately) replicates the barrier option can be found as the solution to a linear system of equations, and constructing it does not require knowledge/implementation of barrier option valuation formulas. The idea
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   is to match the barrier option's value at expiry and along the barrier.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   To illustrate, consider a down-and-out call with strike
   <i>
    K
   </i>
   , expiry
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   , and barrier
   <i>
    B
   </i>
   . (An up-and-out call is treated similarly, except strike-above-the-barrier calls are used as hedge instruments.) Let
   <i>
    Put

   <i>

   <i>
    ti

   -points along the barrier, and its expiry payoff above the barrier. So the barrier option is—to a good approximation when the match points, the
   <i>
    ti
   </i>
   's, are close —replicated buying this portfolio at time 0 and selling it either when the barrier option is knocked out (because sample paths are continuous, this can only happen if the barrier is actually hit) or when it expires. In other words, this represents a static hedge. There is freedom of choice regarding strikes and expiries of the hedge instruments. Derman [6] suggests calendarspread hedging with strikes along the barrier,that is, using
   <i>
    Tj
   </i>
   =
   <i>
    tj
   </i>
   <sup>

   and
   <i>
    Kj
   </i>
   =
   <i>
    B
   </i>
   . This makes the
   <i>
    A
   </i>
   matrix triangular so that we can solve for
   <i>
    αj
   </i>
   's in one easy-to-explain backward-working pass. Another choice—closely related to Carr's work [4]—is to use strike spreads, that is,
   <i>
    Tj
   </i>
   =
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   for all
   <i>
    j
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Kj
   </i>
   's that are different and below the barrier.

   Table 1 gives a numerical comparison of the performance of different hedge portfolios for three-month barrier options; a typical lifetime of a barrier option in foreign exchange markets. Looking at the results in Table 1 for the down-and-out call, we see the appeal of using options as hedge instruments; very few options are needed in the static hedges to achieve a hedge quality that is several orders of magnitude better than usual dynamic

   Constructing static hedges by solving linear equations like equation (1) goes well beyond the Black–Scholes model. For constant elasticity of variance (asset volatility

   In a number of papers
   <math display="inline">

   So a down-and-out call is replicated by buying one strike-

More general symmetry relations enable one to find static hedges for such contracts as up-andout calls, barrier options with rebates, lookback options, and double barrier options ([11] is a survey). Those static hedges will typically involve a continuum of plain vanilla options. Put–call symmetries also exist in models with nonzero interest rates and dividends, and more general dynamics than geometric Brownian motion (see [5]). Note that the strikespread approach from the previous section finds the symmetry-based static hedges without explicit knowledge of closed-form results, and that the perfect replication of the down-and-out call in Table 1—where the strike-
