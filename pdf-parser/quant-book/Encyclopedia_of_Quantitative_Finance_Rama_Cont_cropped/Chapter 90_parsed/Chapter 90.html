    Asian Options
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An Asian option is also known as a fixed-strike Asian option or an average price or average rate option. These options have a payoff based on the average of an underlying asset price over a specified time period. The Asian option has a payoff dependent on the average of the asset price and a strike that is fixed in advance. The other type of Asian option is the average strike option (or floating strike), where the payoff is determined by the difference between the underlying asset price and its average (see Average Strike
   <b>
    Options
   </b>
   ). Asian options are path-dependent options as their payoff depends on the asset price path rather than just on the terminal value.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   If the average is computed using a finite sample of asset price observations taken at a set of regularly spaced time points, we have a discrete Asian option. A continuous time Asian option is obtained by computing the average
   <i>
    via
   </i>
   the integral of the price path over an interval of time. In reality, contracts are based on discrete averaging; however, if there are a large number of averaging dates, there are advantages in working in continuous time. The average itself can be defined to be geometric or arithmetic. When the geometric average is used, the Asian option has a closed-form solution for the price, whereas the option with arithmetic average does not have a known closed-form solution.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   One of the reasons Asian options were invented was to avoid price manipulation toward the end of the option's life. By making the payoff depend on the average price rather than on the price itself, such manipulations have little effect on the option value. For this reason, Asian options are usually of European style. The possibility of exercise before the expiration date would make the option more vulnerable to price manipulation; see [11]. The payoff of an Asian option cannot be obtained by combining other instruments such as vanilla options, forwards, or futures.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Asian options are commonly used for currencies, interest rates, and commodities, and more recently in energy markets. They are useful in corporate hedging situations, for instance, a company exchanging foreign currency for domestic currency at regular intervals. Each transaction could be hedged separately with derivatives or a single Asian option could hedge the "average" rate over the period during which the currency is transferred.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An advantage for the buyer of an Asian option is that it is often less expensive than an equivalent vanilla option. This is because the volatility of the average is lower than the volatility of the asset itself. Another advantage in thinly traded markets is that the payoff does not depend only on the price of the asset on a particular day.

   The main difficulty in pricing and hedging the Asian option is that the random variable
   <math display="inline">
    A_T
   </math>
   does not have a lognormal distribution. This makes the pricing very involved, and an explicit formula does not exist to date. This is an interesting mathematical problem and many research papers have been and still are written on the topic. The first of these was by Boyle and Emmanuel [3] in 1980.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Early methods for pricing the Asian option with arithmetic average involved replacing the arithmetic average
   <math display="inline">
    A_T
   </math>
   with the geometric average
   <math display="inline">
    G_T
   </math>
   , which is lognormally distributed; see [5, 10, 11, 15, 17]. This gives a simple formula, but it underprices the call significantly. However, it is worth noting that the formula leads to a scaling known as the
   <math display="inline">
    1/\sqrt{3}
   </math>
   <i>
    rule
   </i>
   , since for
   <math display="inline">
    t &gt; t_0
   </math>
   , the volatility is scaled down by this factor. That is, the formula involves the term
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{T-t}
   </math>
   . This is a particularly useful observation if the averaging period is quite short relative to the life of the option. See [12], among others, for a description and more details.

  <p block-type="Text">
   The second class of methods used is to approximate the true distribution of the arithmetic average using an approximate distribution, usually lognormal with appropriate parameters. True moments for

  <p block-type="Text">

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A further analytical technique in approximating the price of the Asian option is to establish price bounds. Curran [6] and Rogers and Shi [16] used conditioning to obtain a two-dimensional integral, which proves to be a tight lower bound for the option.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Much work has been done on pricing the Asian option using quasi-analytic methods. Geman and Yor [8] derived a closed-form solution for an "inthe-money" Asian call and a Laplace transform for "at-the-money" and "out-of-the-money" cases. Their methods are based on a relationship between geometric Brownian motion and time-changed Bessel processes. To price the option, one must invert the Laplace transform numerically; see [7]. Shaw [18] demonstrated that the inversion can be done quickly and efficiently for all reasonable parameter choices in Mathematica, making this a fast and effective approach. Linetsky [14] produced a quasi-analytic pricing formula using eigenfunction methods, with highly accurate results, also employing a package such as Mathematica.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Direct numerical methods such as Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo simulation and finite-difference partial differential equation (PDE) methods can be used to price the Asian option (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Lattice Methods for Path-dependent Options
   </b>
   ). In fact, given the popularity of such techniques, these methods were probably amongst the first used by practitioners (and remain popular today). Monte Carlo simulation was used to price Asian options by Broadie and Glasserman [4] and Kemna and Vorst [11], among many other more recent researchers. Simulation methods have the advantage of being widely used by practitioners to price derivatives, so no "new" method is required. Additional practical features such as stochastic volatility or interest rates can be incorporated without a significant increase in complexity. Control variates can often be used (e.g., using a geometric Asian option when pricing an arithmetic option). Additionally, simulation is often used as a benchmark price against which other methods are tested. The disadvantages are that it is computationally expensive, even when variance reduction techniques are used. Lapeyre and Temam [12] showed that Monte Carlo simulation can be competitive under the more advanced schemes they propose and with variance reduction techniques.

   The Asian option is an exotic path-dependent option since the value at any point in time depends on the history of the underlying asset price. Specifically, the value of the option at

   [21] presented numerical methods for solving this PDE. It turns out that the problem can be reduced to two variables (one state and the other time). Rogers and Shi [16], Alziary
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [1], and Andreasen [2] formulated a one-dimensional PDE. The PDE approach is flexible in that it can handle market realities, but it is difficult to solve numerically as the diffusion term is very small for values of interest on the finite-difference grid. Vecer [20] reformulated the problem using analogies to passport options [9] to obtain an unconditionally stable PDE, which is more easily solved.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Methods based on discrete sampling become more appropriate when there are relatively few averaging dates. One simplistic approach is a scaling correction to volatility as described. Other possibilities include a Monte Carlo simulation or numerical solution of a sequence of PDEs [2]. Monte Carlo simulation can be quite efficient when there are only a small number of averaging dates, since the first "step" can take one straight to the averaging period (under the usual exponential Brownian motion model). Andreasen [2] priced discretely sampled Asian options using finitedifference schemes on a sequence of PDEs. This is particularly efficient if the averaging period is short and hence there are only a small number of PDEs to solve. He compared his PDE results to that of Monte Carlo simulation and showed that the finitedifference schemes get within a penny accuracy of the Monte Carlo simulation in less than a second of CPU time.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   To conclude, there has been ongoing research into the methods for pricing the Asian option. It seems, however, the current-state-of-the-art pricing methods (good implementation of inversion of Laplace transform, eigenfunction and other expansions, stable PDE, and Monte Carlo simulation where appropriate) are fast, accurate, and adequate for most uses.
