In addition, fund managers (institutional) need to hedge their FX risk in stocks or bonds if the stocks/bonds are quoted in a foreign currency. With hedging instruments, the FX exposure can be reduced and one can even benefit from certain market scenarios. This kind of participation brings us to the important class of investor-oriented products where the coupon depends on an FX rate or, at maturity, the pay-off (amount, currency) will be determined by an FX rate.

For plain vanilla options, market data, especially volatilities for maturities below 1 year, are published by brokers or banks and are shown on Reuters pages (e.g., TTKLINDEX10, ICAPFXOP, GFIVOLS). For exotic products, new pricing tools, such as Superderivatives, LPA, Bloomberg, ICY, Fenics, and so on, are available for users, but the premium of the option will depend on the pricing model and the adjustments used. For the emerging market currencies such as PLN (Polish zloty), HUF (Hungarian forint), ZAR (South African rand), and so on, which are freely tradable but less liquid, the market data are less transparent. Currencies that are not freely tradable (the currency cannot be cash-settled offshore) such as BRL (Brazilian real) or CNY (Chinese yuan renmimbi) can be traded as a nondeliverable forward (NDF) or as a nondeliverable option (NDO) against a tradable currency. The NDF is a cash-settled product without exchange of notionals, which means that the intrinsic value at maturity will be paid in the free tradable currency based on a fixing source. The underlying of an NDO is the NDF, meaning that exercising the NDO results in an NDF, which will also be cash-settled.

How can we retrieve the correct volatility for a given strike? For sure it is an iterative process. Initially, one uses the at-the-money (ATM) volatility <math display=\"inline\">\\sigma_0</math> and calculates the delta <math display=\"inline\">\\Delta_1</math>. On the basis of <math display=\"inline\">\\Delta_1</math>, a new volatility <math display=\"inline\">\\sigma_1</math> can be retrieved from the volatility matrix. This new volatility leads to a new delta and so on. Now one can define a convergence criterion to stop the iteration. In practice, a fixed number of iterations is used, usually five steps.</p>",

The smile curve is usually set up on some fixed pillars and the points between these pillars are interpolated to get a smooth surface. In the direction of the term structure, the easiest way is to interpolate linearly in the variance. In addition, weights are introduced to highlight or lower the importance of some dates, for example, the release of nonfarm payrolls, local holiday, or a day before or after a weekend. In the direction of the moneyness or delta, one method of interpolation is the cubic spline. The pillars in that direction are 10-delta put, 25-delta put, ATM, 25-delta call, and 10-delta call. Sometimes the 35-delta put and 35-delta call are also used. Unlike equity, in the FX market, the smile surface is decomposed into the symmetric part by using butterflies or strangles and the skew part by using the risk reversals for the fixed deltas.
