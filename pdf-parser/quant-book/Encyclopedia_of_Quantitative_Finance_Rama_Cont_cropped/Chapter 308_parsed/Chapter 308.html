    The Road to Basel II
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Regulatory authorities impose minimum capital requirements and monitor banks through on- and offsite supervision to solve the asymmetric information problem created by the opacity of banks' business and their high leverage. Besides depositor protection, securing the banking sector's key role in the economy, including the monetary transmission process, the credit supply and the provision of payment systems, is an equally important motivation for bank regulation.a
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The development of the "1988 Basel Capital Accord", in short "Basel I", is closely linked to developments in the banking industry after the collapse of the fixed exchange rate system of Bretton Woods. Deregulation of the banking sector, high volatility of financial market prices, particularly exchange rates and interest rates, and increasing competition that fueled rapid lending growth, ultimately contributed to an increasing number of breakdowns in the banking industry. The failure of the German Herstatt Bank in 1974 was an early warning signal. Basel I was the regulatory answer to these developments and became the first common regulatory framework for large and internationally active banks.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The risk sensitivity of minimum capital requirements for credit risk is implemented (and limited) in Basel I by conditioning the risk weight on the borrower type. Loans to sovereigns or banks, for example, receive lower risk weights than corporate exposures. The securitization of financial claims, which has developed into a huge market over the last decade, was not covered at all by Basel I, although rules were often implemented on a national level. At the turn of the millennium, innovations in the financial industry and risk management practice in large, internationally active banks had outpaced the Accord by creating ample opportunities for regulatory capital arbitrage (see [28], for examples).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The 1996 amendment extends the unilateral focus of the Accord on credit risk by adding rules for market risks. Market risks comprise the risk of losses in on- and off-balance sheet positions caused by changes in market prices. More specifically, the amendment requires banks to hold capital for interest rate risk and equities risk in the trading book,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   foreign currency risk, and commodities risk. It also introduces, for the first time, an option for banks to choose between a simpler, less risk-sensitive
   <i>
    standardized method
   </i>
   and a more
   <i>
    advanced internal models approach
   </i>
   that allows the use of banks' own
   <i>
    Value at Risk
   </i>
   models for calculating the required capital cushion.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Different approaches distinguished by the degree of risk sensitivity and individual complexity introduce an evolutionary aspect into the Basel II framework. Banks can migrate to a more complex approach with overall lower capital requirements provided they meet higher standards in risk management and risk measurement procedures. Its key objectives as stated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision were the focus on large, internationally active banks, the macroprudential focus on the stability of the banking system and the goal to enhance competitive equality.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An important way to promote both financial stability and a level playing field is to strengthen risk sensitivity of the minimum capital requirements. This reduces opportunities of
   <i>
    regulatory capital arbitrage
   </i>
   , which may otherwise encourage banks to carry out business transactions entailing risks that are not adequately captured by regulatory capital requirements and to avoid transactions that are overly burdened.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The risk sensitivity of the capital requirements for credit risk, for example, is increased in Basel II by replacing the static risk weights of Basel I with risk weights that either depend on external ratings or are based on a stylized credit risk model and require banks' own estimates of default probabilities as input. Furthermore, operational risk is included in the minimum capital requirements as a new risk category. This transition to model-based minimum capital requirements has not always been without its detractors. Indeed, concerns were raised about the limitations of quantitative models, advocating simpler approaches for regulatory purposes (see [17], especially, for market risk models).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Banking supervision operates somewhere between the two conceptual extremes of rules-based and principles-based regulation. Basel II contains important elements of both concepts. The calculation of a regulatory capital charge based on banks' own estimates of risk components which are inputs to regulatory risk-weight functions is an example of a rules-based approach. The regulatory approval of
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   internal models both for market risk in the trading book and for operational risk is an example of a principles-based approach. In the early stages of its development, a principles-based internal models approach for credit risk was still considered a viable option for the new framework [26]. On the basis of the results of an internal study, the Basel Committee acknowledged that the state of model development at that time could not ensure sufficient comparability across institutions and that a meaningful validation of model parameters and assumptions would be prevented by data limitations [5]. As a consequence, internal models are not eligible for the calculation of regulatory capital for credit risk. The risk-weight functions are defined in the new framework and only the risk components, for example, default probabilities, have to be estimated by banks' internal methods.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Basel II rests on three pillars, the first of these being the
   <i>
    minimum capital requirements
   </i>
   . The
   <i>
    supervisory review process
   </i>
   , which constitutes the second pillar, provides guidance for supervisory practice and banks' internal capital adequacy assessment processes. Whereas the first pillar is a typical rules-based approach, the second pillar is principles-based on account of its very purpose. The minimum capital requirements and guidance on the supervisory review process are complemented by disclosure requirements to enforce
   <i>
    market discipline
   </i>
   , the third pillar of the new framework.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Since this article is concerned with the methodological underpinnings of the new framework, its main focus is on the first pillar and here on the most risk-sensitive, model-based methods. The second pillar is only touched upon while the third is omitted altogether.

   Total capital can be decomposed into core capital (tier 1), for example, paid-up share capital, and supplementary capital (tier 2 and tier 3). Tier 2 capital consists of, for example, general loan loss reserves and subordinated debt (with a maturity of at least five years). Tier 3 capital consists of short-term subordinated debt and can cover market risk alone and this only if the bank has a recognized internal model. Besides the 8% minimum for the TCR, banks also need to set aside a minimum of 4% for their tier 1 ratio, which contains only tier 1 capital in the numerator.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Minimum requirements for credit risk in the banking book typically make the highest contribution to a commercial bank's total regulatory capital charge. They can be measured by two different approaches: the
   <i>
    revised standardized approach
   </i>
   (RSA) and the
   <i>
    internal ratings-based approach
   </i>
   (IRBA). The latter is further differentiated in the
   <i>
    foundation IRBA
   </i>
   and the more complex and risk-sensitive
   <i>
    advanced IRBA
   </i>
   . The RSA risk weights depend on the borrowers' external ratings, whereas the IRBA risk weights are model based and require banks' own estimates of the probability of default, the (expected) loss given default, and the maturity of the exposure. The parameterization of the risk-weight functions differs between asset classes, for example, sovereigns, corporates, and retail clients.

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The Value at Risk of a credit portfolio can be decomposed into the
   <i>
    expected loss
   </i>
   (EL) and the
   <i>
    unex
   </i>
   pected loss (UL). Whereas EL is the mean of the loss distribution, UL is defined as the difference between an adverse quantile of the portfolio's loss distribution (e.g., given by a confidence level of 99.9%) and EL. Expected losses are traditionally covered by general provisions (or general loss reserves) and also considered in the calculation of the interest rate margin whereas UL is covered by a capital cushion. In the IRBA, the risk-weighted assets cover only UL. Therefore, if EL is covered by provisions or revenues and if the model is correct, the likelihood that the bank stays solvent at the risk horizon is equal to the confidence level, consistent with equation (2).
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The risk-weighted assets for credit risk in the IRBA are computed by aggregating over the ULbased capital charges

    Capital Requirements for Credit Risk

  <h4>
   Asymptotic Single-factor Model
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The capital charge for a single asset measures its marginal contribution to the capital requirement for the total portfolio. A
   <i>
    decentralized capital rule
   </i>
   , often referred to as
   <i>
    portfolio invariance
   </i>
   property, requires that the capital charge for an asset depends only on its own risk characteristics and not on the composition of the rest of the portfolio. It is convenient for regulatory capital requirements because it makes it possible to compute the capital charge of a portfolio by adding up the independently calculated capital charges of its assets. This property generally does not hold under a Value at Risk based capital rule because the marginal contribution of a single asset depends on the correlation with the other assets in the portfolio. Therefore, any change in the portfolio composition can affect the capital charge of an individual asset (see Economic Capital Allocation).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Gordy [21] was able to show that portfolio invariance can be achieved for a limiting case given a single-factor version of a common credit risk model. In the following, we refer to this model as the
   <i>

   totic single risk factor (ASRF) model for reasons that will soon become clear. Large-sample approximations had already been used earlier for computational shortcuts but only with additional homogeneity assumptions for the portfolio ([39] and also see

   as an additional parameter. These four risk components and the asset correlation parameter are further discussed in the following subsection.
  </p>
  <h4>
   The Risk Components EAD, LGD, and PD
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The EAD is defined as the expected gross exposure upon default of the obligor and for on-balance sheet items as no less than the currently drawn amount. Credit conversion factors are applied in the case of noncash products such as undrawn credit commitments. In the advanced IRBA, banks use own estimates, whereas in the foundation IRBA, the drawdown factors of undrawn credit lines are given ([7], para. 474). Empirical and theoretical work on EADs in traditional bank lending is scarce. There appears to be some evidence that EAD decreases with credit quality. This may, however, also be the consequence of stricter limits and covenants for borrowers below investment grade [6].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   LGDs are estimates of the loss severity of credit exposures upon default. They are estimated by the bank in the advanced IRBA and for retail exposures in the foundation IRBA as well. Mounting empirical evidence suggests that, at least in certain asset categories, loss severity can systematically fluctuate over time (see, e.g., [3] or [1]), inducing a correlation between default rates and recovery rates. Instead of incorporating this correlation in the ASRF model, banks have to account for systematic risk in their LGD estimates. Therefore, for exposures for which recovery rates are volatile over the economic cycle, the bank must estimate downturn LGDs, that is, estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average. In order to spare banks the estimation of two different LGDs, the downturn LGD is used in (6) also for subtracting EL, although EL depends in theory on the
   <i>
    unconditional
   </i>
   expectation of loss severity. For defaulted loans, banks have to compute a best-estimate LGD on the basis of current economic conditions and facility status (
   <math display="inline">
    [7]
   </math>
   , para. 468 and 471).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The PD parameter measures the probability of the borrower entering default over a one-year horizon. The default event occurs either if the bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligation
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   or if the obligor is past due more than 90 days ([7], para. 452). All banks adopting the IRBA must have an internal rating methodology through which every borrower is assigned a rating grade, which, in turn, determines the PD.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   PD estimates of banks typically lie in a continuum between two methodological concepts:
   <i>
    point-in-time
   </i>
   PDs, which focus on current conditions and are often estimated from market prices, and
   <i>
    through-the-cycle
   </i>
   PDs, which account for the fluctuation of default rates over a business cycle. The exact definition of through-the-cycle PDs is controversial as are their pros and cons for regulatory capital purposes ([6], pp. 10–27 for a rigorous definition and discussion of different methodological concepts of internal ratings and PDs). Arguments in favor of point-in-time PDs are their consistency with a mark-to-mark valuation of the portfolio and the easier validation owing to the shorter one-year horizon. Through-the-cycle PDs are, by construction, less volatile over time; this reduces cyclical effects of regulatory capital requirements. The Basel II framework gives banks some flexibility concerning their PD estimation, which mirrors the diversity of methodologies used in banks.

   in equation (6) fully determines the dependence between the asset value returns of two borrowers in the ASRF model and, in this way, the dependence structure of the portfolio. It is, therefore, by construction, a key driver of UL capital. During the development of Basel II, the original proposal of a flat asset correlation of 0.2 was replaced by the following function depending on the PD of the borrower:

   = 50). For retail lending, the correlations are lower. Apart from reducing the steepness of the risk-weight curve, and, in this way, mitigating cyclical fluctuations of UL capital, the PD dependence of the asset correlation also reflects an on-average lower systematic/higher idiosyncratic risk of firms with a lower credit quality ([33] for empirical evidence).

Empirical work on the estimation of asset correlations faces various limitations, for example, the scarcity of default events, missing traded equity for certain borrower types, and instability of correlations over time. As a consequence, it has produced quite diverse results (

Comparing the asset-correlation parameters in the risk-weighted functions with empirical correlation estimates is, however, misleading because the former are the result of the calibration of the ASRF model to credit risk portfolio models with a richer correlation structure, based on real credit portfolios (see the section Basel II Calibration and Procyclicality).

  <p block-type="Text">
   For small and medium enterprises in the corporate asset class, the asset-correlation parameter also increases with the size of the firm, which is measured by yearly turnover. The dependence on firm size reflects indicative empirical findings that systematic risk is higher for large firms than for small and medium enterprises (see, e.g., [18] or [33]).

   The UL capital charge given by equation (6) captures only losses from default events over a one-year horizon. The market value of a loan with a longer maturity, however, is also sensitive to a change of the borrower's credit quality over this horizon. The maturity adjustment factor

   , which is a function of the loan's time to maturity

   The adjustment factor

   <i>

   Since the maturity adjustment factor depends on the PD, the relative difference between capital charges for one and five years increases from 26% for a PD of 10% up to 242% for a PD of 0.03%. The size of the maturity adjustment has been criticized on the grounds that regulatory capital rules should focus on tail risk events rather than on migration risk. In fact, maturity adjustments quickly decrease for higher confidence levels as migration risk becomes less important [29]. Another criticism has been voiced from a macroprudential perspective. Relatively high values of the adjustment factor for long maturities and correspondingly low values for short maturities can provide incentives for short-term lending. Therefore, from a macro perspective, they can increase the risk of a credit crunch at times of stress and reinforce procyclical effects of the framework.

A loss occurs only if the contract has a positive market value when the counterparty defaults; it also depends on the costs from replacing the contract by a similar transaction with a different counterparty. In this context, Basel II offers three approaches to address credit risk mitigation.

  <p block-type="Text">
   The most risk-sensitive approach is the

   . In this approach, which is subject to regulatory approval, the EAD is the product of a multiplier and the
   <i>
    effective expected positive exposure (EPE)
   </i>
   . The effective EPE is defined as weighted average over time of effective expected exposures over the first year. Effective expected exposure, in turn, is the maximum expected exposure that occurs at a specific date or at a previous date ([7], para. 25–68).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In Basel II, the multiplier is set to 1.4. Subject to regulatory approval, it can also be estimated by the bank, recognizing a floor of 1.2. Applying a multiplier is important because the EPE can be interpreted as a loan-equivalent value only under certain assumptions: the portfolio needs to be infinitely granular and the exposures need to be mutually independent on a counterparty level and also from the counterparty's credit quality, that is, there is no wrong way risk. In addition, the EPE calculation assumes a static portfolio and does not consider
   <i>
    roll-over risk
   </i>
   from replacing transactions that mature before the oneyear horizon. Canabarro et al. [15] and Wilde [40] explore the sensitivity of the multiplier against these assumptions.

   same default probability (e.g., wholesale credit relative to retail credit).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Parallel to the bottom-up approach, the Basel Committee pursues a top-down approach with the goal to broadly maintain the level of capital requirements, while providing incentives for the more risksensitive approaches of the revised framework. The top-down approach was implemented by five quantitative impact studies in which banks were invited to compute the capital requirements for their current portfolios under the current accord as well as under the envisaged Basel II framework. One result of these exercises was the introduction of a scaling factor of 1.06 which is applied to risk weights for credit risk. Subsequent to the finalization of the Basel II framework, ongoing efforts have continued to monitor the level of capital requirements.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The dynamics of minimum capital requirements which are driven by the economic cycle, are not least as important as the level of capital. Since default rates and recovery rates are often systematically affected by the business cycle, banks adopting an IRBA might face higher capital requirements in an economic downturn. Stricter lending policies could then restrict the credit supply and generate negative feedback effects on the real economy, a phenomenon that is often described as
   <i>
    procyclicality
   </i>
   . In anticipation of the dynamic impact of the new IRBA, various mitigants have already been built into the new framework, for example, a flattening of the risk-weight functions
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   by a negative dependency of the asset correlation parameter on PD and the requirements to estimate downturn LGDs and to carry out procyclicality stress tests.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Empirical research has confirmed that fluctuations in regulatory capital requirements under the new framework are expected to be economically significant (see, e.g., [16] or [30]). Major empirical obstacles, for instance, uncertainties about the dynamic properties of PD and LGD estimates in real IRBA systems, have contributed to widely dispersed results. Furthermore, financial innovation, for example, the emergence of securitization and the originate-to-distribute model, has affected the traditional bank lending channel in ways that are difficult to predict. Procyclical effects, therefore, still pose a challenge for empirical research, risk management, and financial regulation.

   <b>
    Securitization Framework
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Reducing the potential for regulatory capital arbitrage in securitization was a key target behind developing the new framework (see examples in [28]). For this purpose, regulators, in designing new rules, considered the level of capital held internally by banks for securitization exposures and set out to achieve capital neutrality between on-balance and offbalance sheet transactions as well as to ensure that capital charges for individual tranches capture the
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   relative distribution of risks across all tranches. At the same time, interfering in market segments where securitization was deemed a viable instrument of risk transfer needed to be avoided.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   For banks following an IRBA, two methods are available in Basel II. If the tranches carry external ratings, they have to use the
   <i>
    ratings-based approach
   </i>
   (RBA). In this case, the risk weights are tied to ratings and account also for the granularity of the pool, measured by the effective number of exposures (or the inverse of the
   <i>
    Herfindahl—Hirschman Index
   </i>
   ). If a specific tranche is unrated, its rating can be inferred from lower, more risky tranches.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Peretyatkin and Perraudin [35] compare the RBA capital charges with the model of Pykhtin and Dev [36, 37] on which they are based. They identify two simplified assumptions of the RBA that may have a significant effect on the capital charge: first, the missing differentiation between maturities and, second, not accounting for differences in correlation between the tranched exposures and exposures in the loan book.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The
   <i>
    supervisory formula approach
   </i>
   (SFA) provides an alternative for regulatory capital calculation if external ratings are not available and cannot be inferred. The SFA is based on a stylized model, similar to the ASRF model for traditional loans. If the required input data are unavailable, the exposure needs to be deducted from capital. In the special case of eligible liquidity facilities and credit enhancements in connection with ABCP (asset-backed commercial paper) programs, banks can determine the capital charge by their own internal assessment.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The conceptual underpinnings of the SFA are outlined in [23] and [22]. It strikes a balance between risk sensitivity and the tractability required for regulatory purposes. In the ASRF framework of the IRBA, the cumulative capital charge

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   A direct application of the ASRF model to measure the risk of securitization tranches was not deemed as meaningful since the model implies relatively high capital charges for junior tranches, whereas at a certain level of protection the capital charge jumps to zero, depending also on the thickness of the tranche. This problem is solved by the
   <i>
    uncertainty in loss prioritization
   </i>
   assumption. By this assumption, the deterministic enhancement level
   <i>

   in equation (11) is replaced by the

   . For

   −−−→ ∞, the model converges to the case of strict loss prioritization. The assumption that the exact level of protection of a tranche is uncertain can be motivated by the complexity of deal-specific contractual cash flows, often termed the
   <i>
    waterfall
   </i>
   of a securitization transaction, which cannot be explicitly modeled in the interest of tractability. In addition to the single risk factor assumption shared by the ASRF model, the SFA model assumes that the collateral pool is homogeneous and that LGDs are pairwise independent conditional on the systematic risk factor
   <i>
    X
   </i>
   and subject only to idiosyncratic risk.

   Computing the SFA-based capital requirement for a tranche requires five inputs: two tranchespecific figures from the bank, namely, the nominal enhancement level

   The model developed by Gordy and Jones assumes that a bank's exposure to every securitization is a negligible part of its total portfolio and that the collateral pool contains only loans or bonds but not that the collateral pool is infinitely fine grained.

   A level of conservatism is introduced by requiring deduction from capital for any protection level up to

It includes losses from failures in IT systems, fraud, natural catastrophes, and legal risk, but excludes losses from strategic and reputational risks.

   The loss distribution approach seems to have emerged as the most common modeling framework (see [4], as an example). Loss severity and loss frequency are typically modeled separately. Losses are aggregated over loss event types (e.g. external fraud or business disruptions and system failures) and business lines (e.g., corporate finance or retail banking). The Value at Risk figures of different business lines must be added, although banks can take into account correlation effects subject to regulatory approval.

The complex methods typically require an extensive set of historical loss data. The relative scarcity of highimpact, low-frequency events in individual banks has prompted the construction of external data bases. The outstanding methodological challenges and data restrictions in the modeling of operational risk are arguments in favor of complementing the quantitative risk measurement methodology with a self assessment, using, for example, scenario analyses and scorecards, a distinct pillar 2 review, and market discipline.

   The plus factor is based on mandatory quarterly backtesting with trading results of the last 250 days. The size of the plus factor depends on the number of Value at Risk exceptions and is given by a traffic-light table ([7], Annex 10, para. 27–61).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Various papers have advocated different backtesting methodologies (e.g., [31] or [13]). Accepting the imperfect nature of signals from backtesting results, supervisors have substantial leeway in how to assess the backtesting methodology of banks in their jurisdiction, for example, concerning the choice between a Value at Risk measure based on a "hypothetical profit and loss", assuming a static portfolio, or on the "actual profit and loss", which includes also commissions and intraday trading.

   The
   <i>
    specific risk charge SRCt
   </i>
   in equation (13) provides a buffer against idiosyncratic risk, including default risk and event risk. For banks that do not have methodologies in place to adequately capture event and default risks, a multiplicative factor of 4 instead of 3 applies. If the model captures only generic market risk,
   <i>
    SRCt
   </i>
   is computed by the standardized approach.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The risk measurement approach of the 1996 amendment was challenged by financial innovation, which caused a shift of credit exposures from the banking book into the trading book when pools of traditional loans were packaged as tranches of collateralized debt obligations (CDO) and sold in the market. Although the risk of a credit exposure is not affected by transferring it between banking book and trading book, the risk measurement framework becomes different. Not only the different considered risk factors but also the shorter risk horizon and the lower confidence level drive a wedge between capital charges for the same exposure dependent on its assignment to the banking book or the trading book. As a consequence, making credit risk tradable by securitization created rich opportunities for regulatory capital arbitrage.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Recognizing the inherent risks of this development, the Basel Committee already decided in 2005 to reexamine the trading book treatment and issued two consultative documents with proposals for a revision in January 2009. An
   <i>
    incremental risk charge
   </i>
   is introduced for the internal models approach, which refines the treatment of specific risk and reduces the gap between regulatory capital charges in the banking book and in the trading book. It includes default risk and credit migration risk and also takes account of correlations between default events and migration events, which cause a clustering of both. Widening the definition beyond default risk alone reflects experience from the 2007 subprime turbulence that material creditrisk-related losses occurred without actual default events. Securitization positions cannot be incorporated into the incremental risk charge model on the grounds that a reliable quantification of diversification benefits is not possible given the current state of risk modeling. A standardized method applies instead.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Furthermore, a
   <i>
    stressed Value at Risk
   </i>
   is suggested that needs to be added to the Value at Risk in equation (13). For this purpose, a bank has to calibrate its model to historical data from a period of significant financial stress relevant to its portfolio. In summary, with the revised treatment of the trading book, the Basel Committee has addressed key limitations of previous capital requirements for the trading book and also incorporated lessons from the 2007 subprime turbulence.

    Supervisory Review Process and Validation of Credit Risk Components
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Whereas pillar 1 is concerned with regulatory minimum capital requirements, pillar 2 is about the internal capital adequacy assessment process. A bank has to ensure through its internal capital assessment that its capital basis is commensurate with its risk profile. The internal capital assessment has to address all material risks not captured in pillar 1, notably interest rate risk in the banking book, liquidity risk, and concentration risk. Banks' assessment of capital adequacy is evaluated in the supervisory review and evaluation process. This section is focused on two aspects that may require complex quantitative models, namely, the measurement of concentration risk in credit portfolios and stress testing.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <i>
    Concentration Risk
   </i>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Since lending is the primary activity of most banks, credit risk concentrations often present the most material risk concentrations ([7], para. 771). They are particularly important as they are not captured by the ASRF model, which is the basis of the regulatory capital requirements for credit risk in pillar 1. In a real bank portfolio with a finite number of assets, two of its assumptions, namely, that systematic risk is fully captured by a single factor and that the portfolio is infinitely granular, are not fulfilled. Deviations from this ideal case create
   <i>
    concentration risk
   </i>
   , which is not a different risk category but rather a key driver of credit risk. It can be decomposed into
   <i>
    single-name concentration
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    sectoral concentration
   </i>
   . Single-name concentration refers to an unbalanced exposure distribution across borrowers, whereas sectoral concentration refers to exposure concentration either in regional sectors or industry sectors ([9] gives an overview of various measurement tools for both kinds of risk concentrations).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Single-name concentration can generally be diversified away by increasing the number of exposures. A
   <i>
    granularity adjustment
   </i>
   for regulatory capital requirements to address single-name concentration was considered but not included in Basel II. Its computational burden was later significantly reduced by refined proposals in [34] and [24].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   In the special case of a homogeneous portfolio (in terms of the risk components that enter the IRBA risk weight function), the granularity adjustment in
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   [24] computed from the loan volumes is linear in the Herfindahl—Hirschman Index. This gives a theoretical motivation for this popular but otherwise
   <i>
    ad hoc
   </i>
   concentration measure.
   <i>
    Ad hoc
   </i>
   measures generally use only information on exposure size in the portfolio. Model-based approaches consider also default probabilities and correlations and allow a risk quantification in terms of required capital. Therefore, model-based approaches have a higher informational value than
   <i>
    ad hoc
   </i>
   indicators.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Accounting for sectoral concentrations is technically more demanding than single-name concentrations since they drive the systematic risk through cross-sectoral default dependencies. At the same time, they are more relevant for typical credit portfolios of banks than name concentrations [19]. The asset-correlation parameter in the IRBA risk-weight functions was calibrated as an average correlation value, appropriate for portfolios that are very well diversified across sectors. Without further knowledge on this calibration procedure, it is, therefore, not possible to compute an adjustment of the ASRF model with as much rigor as the granularity adjustment in [24]. Contrary to the ASRF model, standard portfolio models for credit risk automatically account for risk concentrations. Therefore, the internal capital adequacy assessment process should be well suited to ensure that risk concentrations are adequately captured by capital.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <i>
    Stress Tests
   </i>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The inability to capture extreme events or "tail risk" is a commonly known shortcoming of standard risk models, which was confirmed by the market disruptions in the wake of the 2007 subprime turbulence. Therefore, the transition to model-based capital rules has increased the importance of stress tests (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Stress Testing
   </b>
   ). Initially introduced as compulsory in the 1996 amendment for internal market risk models, market risk is still the area in which stress testing methodologies are most advanced (see, e.g., [2, 12], and [32]).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Stress tests of credit portfolios are an essential element of the new framework. Stress scenarios should consider economic downturns, market-risk events, and liquidity conditions ([7], para. 434–437). They need to be integrated into the risk management framework of the institution and, therefore, they are typically based on institution-specific stress scenarios and
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   use internal risk models. At least one out of different components of a credit risk model are usually stressed: PD, LGD, volatility and correlation parameters, or the systematic risk factors. Feeding "stressed" PDs or LGDs into the ASRF model is a common approach that provides valuable information on the potential impact of the stress scenario on regulatory capital requirements. Its informational value for risk management decisions, however, is constrained by the stylized structure of the ASRF model, for example, its insensitivity to risk concentrations.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Stress tests of credit portfolios can serve three different purposes. First, they allow to assess the capital adequacy in selected stress scenarios. Second, they can help validate a model. Finding, for example, that a model does not react meaningfully to stressed conditions could be a warning signal. Third, they can help dampen the time variation of minimum capital requirements and to mitigate procyclical effects. This purpose can be achieved if stress tests are used to determine a dynamic capital buffer that is accumulated under benign and run down under adverse economic conditions.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Stress tests are typically either carried out for a broad economic scenario affecting the total portfolio or with stress scenarios confined to one or few industry sector(s). Particularly in the first case, the link between the credit risk drivers, modeled at the micro or portfolio level and the macroeconomic level, still poses a significant methodological and data challenge. Stress tests with sector-specific or borrower-specific scenarios can be useful to detect
   <i>
    hidden risk concentrations
   </i>
   in credit portfolios, which affect portfolio risk through elevated default correlations between certain (groups of) borrowers [14].

    Outstanding Challenges to Future Regulation
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Risk measurement in the context of future regulation faces at least three major challenges that have also gained in prominence in the 2007 subprime turbulence. The first is the need to broaden the scope of covered risks, in particular, by giving more attention to liquidity risk. The second is to further improve the risk assessment methodology, for example, by better taking into account linkages between different risk categories. The third is the need to strengthen a system-oriented
   <i>
    macroprudential
   </i>
   approach to bank regulation.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The first challenge pertains to liquidity risk [10], which played a prominent role in the 2007 subprime turbulence. An imminent shortage in funding liquidity due to unexpectedly high liquidity demands from liquidity facilities granted to special purpose vehicles is a case in point.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As a second challenge, the 2007 subprime turbulence uncovered weaknesses in modeling the economic risk of specific financial instruments as well as between different risk categories. One example is the collective increase of market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk, which suggests a more integrated treatment in internal capital modeling [11].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The third major challenge is a more prominent role of a macroprudential perspective in regulation. Strategic interactions among market participants, for example, herding behavior, played an important role when the 2007 subprime turbulence unfolded into a major financial crisis. Their consequences and the resulting endogeneity of risk are not well captured either by regulatory minimum capital requirements or by statistical risk models currently used in financial institutions. Potential procyclical effects of risk-sensitive capital rules can provide another example that the micro- and the macroprudential perspectives do not necessarily coincide. Hence, supplementing regulation with a stronger macroprudential dimension still poses a formidable challenge.
