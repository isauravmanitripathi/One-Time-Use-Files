In the early stages of its development, a principles-based internal models approach for credit risk was still considered a viable option for the new framework [26]. On the basis of the results of an internal study, the Basel Committee acknowledged that the state of model development at that time could not ensure sufficient comparability across institutions and that a meaningful validation of model parameters and assumptions would be prevented by data limitations [5]. As a consequence, internal models are not eligible for the calculation of regulatory capital for credit risk. The risk-weight functions are defined in the new framework and only the risk components, for example, default probabilities, have to be estimated by banks' internal methods.</p>",

A <i>decentralized capital rule</i>, often referred to as <i>portfolio invariance</i> property, requires that the capital charge for an asset depends only on its own risk characteristics and not on the composition of the rest of the portfolio. It is convenient for regulatory capital requirements because it makes it possible to compute the capital charge of a portfolio by adding up the independently calculated capital charges of its assets. This property generally does not hold under a Value at Risk based capital rule because the marginal contribution of a single asset depends on the correlation with the other assets in the portfolio.

They are estimated by the bank in the advanced IRBA and for retail exposures in the foundation IRBA as well. Mounting empirical evidence suggests that, at least in certain asset categories, loss severity can systematically fluctuate over time (see, e.g., [3] or [1]), inducing a correlation between default rates and recovery rates. Instead of incorporating this correlation in the ASRF model, banks have to account for systematic risk in their LGD estimates. Therefore, for exposures for which recovery rates are volatile over the economic cycle, the bank must estimate downturn LGDs, that is, estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average. In order to spare banks the estimation of two different LGDs, the downturn LGD is used in (6) also for subtracting EL, although EL depends in theory on the <i>unconditional</i> expectation of loss severity. For defaulted loans, banks have to compute a best-estimate LGD on the basis of current economic conditions and facility status (<math display=\"inline\">[7]</math>, para. 468 and 471).</p>",

The exact definition of through-the-cycle PDs is controversial as are their pros and cons for regulatory capital purposes ([6], pp. 10–27 for a rigorous definition and discussion of different methodological concepts of internal ratings and PDs). Arguments in favor of point-in-time PDs are their consistency with a mark-to-mark valuation of the portfolio and the easier validation owing to the shorter one-year horizon. Through-the-cycle PDs are, by construction, less volatile over time; this reduces cyclical effects of regulatory capital requirements. The Basel II framework gives banks some flexibility concerning their PD estimation, which mirrors the diversity of methodologies used in banks.</p>",

The size of the maturity adjustment has been criticized on the grounds that regulatory capital rules should focus on tail risk events rather than on migration risk. In fact, maturity adjustments quickly decrease for higher confidence levels as migration risk becomes less important [29]. Another criticism has been voiced from a macroprudential perspective. Relatively high values of the adjustment factor for long maturities and correspondingly low values for short maturities can provide incentives for short-term lending. Therefore, from a macro perspective, they can increase the risk of a credit crunch at times of stress and reinforce procyclical effects of the framework.</p>",

In addition, the EPE calculation assumes a static portfolio and does not consider <i>roll-over risk</i> from replacing transactions that mature before the oneyear horizon. Canabarro et al.

The top-down approach was implemented by five quantitative impact studies in which banks were invited to compute the capital requirements for their current portfolios under the current accord as well as under the envisaged Basel II framework. One result of these exercises was the introduction of a scaling factor of 1.06 which is applied to risk weights for credit risk. Subsequent to the finalization of the Basel II framework, ongoing efforts have continued to monitor the level of capital requirements.</p>",

Stricter lending policies could then restrict the credit supply and generate negative feedback effects on the real economy, a phenomenon that is often described as <i>procyclicality</i>.

This problem is solved by the <i>uncertainty in loss prioritization</i> assumption. By this assumption, the deterministic enhancement level <i>ζ</i> in equation (11) is replaced by the <i>effective</i> enhancement level <i>Z(ζ )</i>. Specifying <i>Z(ζ )</i> as a Dirichlet process with parameter <i>τ</i> , the marginal distribution of <i>Z(ζ )</i> is <i>Beta(τ ζ, τ (</i>1 − <i>ζ ))</i>. For <i>τ</i> −−−→ ∞, the model converges to the case of strict loss prioritization. The assumption that the exact level of protection of a tranche is uncertain can be motivated by the complexity of deal-specific contractual cash flows, often termed the <i>waterfall</i> of a securitization transaction, which cannot be explicitly modeled in the interest of tractability. In addition to the single risk factor assumption shared by the ASRF model, the SFA model assumes that the collateral pool is homogeneous and that LGDs are pairwise independent conditional on the systematic risk factor <i>X</i> and subject only to idiosyncratic risk.</p>",

Although the risk of a credit exposure is not affected by transferring it between banking book and trading book, the risk measurement framework becomes different. Not only the different considered risk factors but also the shorter risk horizon and the lower confidence level drive a wedge between capital charges for the same exposure dependent on its assignment to the banking book or the trading book. As a consequence, making credit risk tradable by securitization created rich opportunities for regulatory capital arbitrage.</p>",

An <i>incremental</i> <i>risk charge</i> is introduced for the internal models approach, which refines the treatment of specific risk and reduces the gap between regulatory capital charges in the banking book and in the trading book. It includes default risk and credit migration risk and also takes account of correlations between default events and migration events, which cause a clustering of both. Widening the definition beyond default risk alone reflects experience from the 2007 subprime turbulence that material creditrisk-related losses occurred without actual default events. Securitization positions cannot be incorporated into the incremental risk charge model on the grounds that a reliable quantification of diversification benefits is not possible given the current state of risk modeling. A standardized method applies instead.</p>",

Their consequences and the resulting endogeneity of risk are not well captured either by regulatory minimum capital requirements or by statistical risk models currently used in financial institutions. Potential procyclical effects of risk-sensitive capital rules can provide another example that the micro- and the macroprudential perspectives do not necessarily coincide. Hence, supplementing regulation with a stronger macroprudential dimension still poses a formidable challenge.</p>",
