# **Credit Default Swaps**

A credit default swap (CDS) is a contract between two parties, the *protection buyer* and a *protection seller*, whereby the protection buyer is compensated for the loss generated by a *credit event* in a reference instrument (see Figure 1). The credit event can be the default of the reference entity, lack of payment of coupon, or other corporate events defined in the contract. In return, the protection buyer pays a premium, equal to an annual percentage *X* of the notional, to the protection seller. The premium *X*, quoted in basis points or percentage points of the notional, is called the *CDS spread*. This spread is paid (semi)annually or quarterly in arrears until either maturity is reached or default occurs.

There are various methods for settlement at default. In a *cash settlement*, the protection seller pays the protection buyer the face value of the reference asset minus its postdefault market value. In a *physical settlement*, the protection buyer receives the initial price of the reference minus the postdefault market value, but, in turn, must make physical delivery of the reference asset or a bond from a pool of eligible assets to the protection seller in exchange for par. In both cases, the postdefault market value of the reference is typically determined by a dealer poll. The contract may also stipulate a fixed or "digital" cash payment at default, representing a fixed percentage of the notional value.

**Example** A protection buyer purchases 5-year protection on an issuer with notional \$10 million at an annual premium (spread) of 300 basis points or 3%. Suppose the reference issuer defaults 4 months after inception and that the reference obligation has a recovery rate (*see* **Recovery Rate**) of 45%. Thus, 3 months after inception, the protection buyer makes the first spread payment, roughly equal to \$10 million × 0*.*03 × 0*.*25 = \$75 000. At default, the protection seller compensates the buyer for the loss by paying \$10 million × *(*100–45%*)* = \$5*.*5 million, assuming the contract is settled in cash. At the same time, the protection buyer pays to the seller the premium accrued since the last payment date, roughly equal to \$10 million × 0*.*03 × 1*/*12 = \$25 000. The payments are netted. With these cash flows the swap expires; there are no further obligations in the contract.

CDS contracts are usually documented according to International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) standards and specify the following:

- A reference entity, whose default (the "credit event") triggers the default payments in the CDS.
- A reference obligation, which can be a loan, a bond issued by a corporation or a sovereign nation, or any other debt instrument.
- A maturity, the common maturities being 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years although the majority of standardized CDSs are 5-year swaps.
- A calculation agent, responsible for computing the payouts related to the transaction. The calculation agent can be one of the counterparties of the CDS or a third party.
- A set of deliverable obligations, in case of physical settlement.

CDSs were introduced in 1997 by JPMorgan and subsequently became the most common form of credit derivative, amounting to a notional value of USD 64 trillion in 2008. With the onset of the financial crisis, this notional volume has gone down to around USD 38 trillion in the first half of 2009, but it remains large.

CDSs are over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and are not yet exchange traded. The CDS market is a dealer market where a dozen major institutions control an overwhelming proportion of the volume and post quotes for protection premiums on various reference entities.

## **Uses of Credit Default Swaps**

To gain exposure to the credit risk of a firm, an investor can purchase a bond issued by the corporation by paying the face value (or current price) of the bond and collect the interest paid by the issuer. Alternatively, he/she could sell protection in a credit swap referenced on the issuer's bond. Relative to buying the reference security directly, the CDS position has the advantage of leading to the same exposure but not requiring a capital at inception. Also, if the reference entity is a foreign or sovereign entity, a CDS with a domestic counterparty might greatly simplify the legal structure of the transaction.

The protection buyer is short the credit risk associated with the reference obligation. If the buyer actually owns the reference security, then the CDS

![](_page_1_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 1** Structure of a credit default swap (CDS)

acts as a hedge against default. For a bank hedging its loans, this can lead to economic and regulatory capital relief. If the buyer does not have exposure to the reference security, the CDS enables him/her to take a speculative short position that benefits from a deterioration of the issuer's creditworthiness.

CDSs are often used to hedge against losses in the event of a default. Thus, CDSs can be viewed as insurance contracts against default or, more generally, as insurance against credit events. However, it is important to note that, unlike the case of insurance contracts, the protection buyer does not need to own the underlying security or have any exposure to it. In fact, an investor can speculate on the default of an entity by buying protection on a reference entity. Thus, they are more like deep out-of-themoney equity puts rather than insurance contracts.

The sheer volume of the CDS market indicates that a large portion of contracts are speculative since, in many cases, the outstanding notional of CDSs is (much) larger than the total debt of the reference entity. For example, when it filed for bankruptcy on September 14, 2008, Lehman Brothers had \$155 billion of outstanding debt, but more than \$400 billion notional value of CDS contracts had been written with Lehman as reference entity [8].

Also, unlike insurance companies, which are required to hold reserves in accordance with their issued insurance claims, a protection seller in a CDS is not required to maintain any reserves to pay off buyers. An important case is the event where a protection seller has insufficient funds to cover the default payment, thereby defaulting on its CDS payment. A famous example is the downfall of AIG, in which CDSs sold by its Financial Products subsidiary (AIGFP) played a major role.

CDSs, like many other credit derivatives, are unfunded and typically do not appear as a liability on the balance sheet of the protection seller. This off-balance sheet nature makes them attractive to many investors, allowing them to take a synthetic exposure to a reference entity without directly investing in it. However, it can also lead to a lack of transparency and generate large exposures, which are not readily visible to regulators and market participants, and not subject to adequate capital requirements.

## **Valuation**

A basic question is to determine the fair swap spread, or the premium, at inception. The CDS spread must equate the present value at inception of the premium payments (premium leg) and the present value of the payments at default. After inception, the swap must be marked to the market. Arbitrage-free valuation of credit default swaps can be done by using the riskneutral pricing principle (*see* **Risk-neutral Pricing**): we assume a pricing measure such that the present value at *t* of any payout *H* at *T >t* is *E*[*B(t, T )H*] where *B(t, T )* is the (risk-free) discount factor.

Consider a CDS with the notional *N*, payment dates *T*1*, T*2*,...,Tn* = *T* . Denote the (random) date of the underlying credit event as *τ* . A key role is played by the conditional risk-neutral survival probability *S(t, T )* = *(τ > T* |F*t)* where F*<sup>t</sup>* represents information available at date *t*. We denote *S(T )* = *S(*0*,T)*, its value at the inception of the contract. Denote the recovery rate by *R*, and *R* = *E*[*R*], the "implied" recovery rate (*see* **Recovery Swap**).

The premium leg pays a fixed annual percentage *X* on the notional *N* at dates *Ti* until default: the cash flow at *Ti* is therefore

$$XN(T_i - T_{i-1})1_{\tau > T_i} \tag{1}$$

The value at inception *t* = 0 of this stream of cash flows is therefore

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} XN(T_{i} - T_{i-1})B(0, T_{i})E^{\mathbb{Q}}[1_{\tau > T_{i}}|\mathcal{F}_{0}]$$
$$= XN \sum_{i=1}^{n} (T_{i} - T_{i-1})B(0, T_{i})S(0, T_{i})$$
$$= XN \sum_{i=1}^{n} (T_{i} - T_{i-1})D(0, T_{i}) \qquad (2)$$

where *D(*0*,T)* = *B(*0*, T )S(T )* is the risky discount factor and we have assumed independence of default times, recovery rates, and interest rates.

The protection leg (or default leg) can be modeled as a lump payment *N (*1 − *R)* at *Ti* if default occurs between *Ti*<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and *Ti* (alternatively, one can consider other payment schemes such as payment at default [3, 4]). This can be represented as a stream of cash flows *N (*1 − *R)*1*Ti*<sup>−</sup>1≤*τ*≤*Ti* paid at *Ti*. The value at inception (t = 0) of this cash-flow stream

$$N\sum_{i=1}^{n} B(0, T_{i})E^{\mathbb{Q}}[(1-R)1_{T_{i-1}\leq\tau\leq T_{i}}|\mathcal{F}_{0}]$$
$$= N(1-\overline{R})\sum_{i=1}^{n} B(0, T_{i})\mathbb{Q}(T_{i-1}\leq\tau\leq T_{i})$$
$$= N(1-\overline{R})\sum_{i=1}^{n} B(0, T_{i})(S(T_{i-1}) - S(T_{i}))$$
(3)

If payments are made at dates other than *Ti*, then accrued interest must be added. If payment dates are frequent (e.g., quarterly) the correction is small.

The fair spread for maturity *Tn* (or contracted spread or par spread) is defined as the spread that equalizes at inception the values of the fixed and protection legs:

$$\begin{aligned} &XN\sum_{i=1}^{n}(T_{i}-T_{i-1})D(0,T_{i})\\ &=N(1-\overline{R})\sum_{i=1}^{n}B(0,T_{i})[S(T_{i-1})-S(T_{i})] \end{aligned} \tag{4}$$

which yields

$$X = \text{CDS}(T_n)$$

$$= \frac{(1 - \overline{R}) \sum_{i=1}^{n} B(0, T_i)(S(T_{i-1}) - S(T_i))}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (T_i - T_{i-1}) B(0, T_i) S(T_i)}$$
(5)

Figure 2 shows the term structure of CDS spreads written on Lehman Brothers in September 2008.

To derive this formula, we have assumed that the firm's default time and recovery rate are independent, that interest rate movements are independent from

![](_page_2_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Figure 2** Term structure of CDS spreads on Lehman Brothers on September 8, 2008

default times, and that the protection seller has negligible default probability (no counterparty risk Counterparty Credit Risk). All these assumptions can be relaxed, especially in the context of reducedform (see Reduced Form Credit Risk Models; **Intensity-based Credit Risk Models**) pricing models  $[3, 5-7]$ . Hull and White  $[6]$  discuss the incorporation of counterparty risk in CDSs. We note that

- CDS spreads depend on the term structure of default probabilities and on the term structure of interest rates, but only through payment dates  $T_1, \ldots T_n$ : two models that agree on the term structure of default probabilities will agree on CDS spreads.
- CDS spread depends on the recovery rate only through its expectation  $\overline{R}$  under the pricing measure  $\mathbb{Q}$ . In market quotes,  $\overline{R}$  has been usually chosen to be 40% for corporates, although this convention is subject to change.

#### **Implied Default Probability**

Given an estimate for the expected recovery rate  $\overline{R}$  and the term structure of discount factors, one can solve equation (5) for the term structure of default probabilities given the CDS spreads  $\text{CDS}(T_1), \ldots, \text{CDS}(T_n)$ . The solution  $S(T_i)$  is called the *implied survival probability* and  $1 - S(T_i)$  is the implied default probability or the "risk-neutral" default probability implied by CDS quotes.

This procedure of inverting survival probabilities from CDS spreads is analogous to the procedure of stripping discount factors/zero coupon bond prices from bond yields (see Yield Curve Construction). Note that, as for yield curve construction, there are, in general, many more dates  $T_i$  (quarterly payments) than CDS maturities; hence, reconstructing  $S(T)$ from CDS spreads requires interpolation or extra assumptions on survival probabilities. For example, survival probabilities are commonly parameterized as

$$S(t,T) = \exp\left[-\int_{t}^{T} h(t,u) \, \mathrm{d}u\right] \tag{6}$$

where  $h(t, T) = -\partial_T S(t, T)/S(t, T)$  is the forward hazard rate (defined analogously to the forward interest rate Heath-Jarrow-Morton Approach).<sup>a</sup> Reduced-form models (see Reduced Form Credit Risk Models; Intensity-based Credit Risk Models) lead to parametric functional forms for  $h(t, .)$ , which can then be used to calibrate parameters to the observed CDS spreads.

**Figure 4** Hazard rates implied by CDS spreads on Lehman Brothers on September 8, 2008

Figure 3 shows survival probabilities for Lehman Brothers implied from CDS quotes on September 8, 2008, shortly before Lehman's default. Assuming that the hazard rate *h(t, T )* is piecewise linear in *T* , we obtain the forward (annual) hazard rates shown in Figure 4.

This example might serve as a warning: such implied or "risk-neutral" default probabilities do not necessarily convey any information about the actual likelihood of the default of the reference entity, but they simply convey a market consensus on the premium for default protection at various maturities. Note also that the implied default probabilities and hazard rates depend on the assumption used for recovery rates.

## **Mark-to-Market Value of a Credit Default Swap (CDS) Position**

At inception (say, *t* = 0) the mark-to-market value of a CDS position is zero for both counterparties. At a later date *t >* 0, this value is no longer zero: the mark-to-market value for the protection seller is the difference between the values of the fixed and protection legs:

$$\text{CDS}(T_n)N\sum_{T_i>t}(T_i - T_{i-1})B(t, T_i)S(t, T_i)$$
$$-N(1 - \overline{R})\sum_{T_i>t}B(t, T_i)(S(t, T_{i-1}) - S(t, T_i))$$
(7)

where the sum runs over the remaining payments and the survival probabilities are now computed at time *t*. This quantity can be positive or negative, just as in an interest rate swap.

The mark-to-market value of the protection seller's position is the negative of the buyer's value (7). Note that the mark-to-market value (7) can be negative. This occurs when the credit quality of the reference name has improved since inception, and default protection is cheaper at current conditions, that is, available for a lower spread than that agreed upon at inception.

## **Triangle Formula**

Consider now the simple case where the default time is described by a constant hazard rate *λ* (*see* **Hazard** Rate):

$$S(0, T) = \exp\left(-\int_0^T \lambda \, \mathrm{d}t\right) = \exp(-\lambda T) \qquad (8)$$

If payments are assumed frequent,  $T_i - T_{i-1} =$  $\Delta T \ll T$ , we can approximate the terms in equation  $(5)$  as

$$S(T_{i-1}) - S(T_i)$$
  
=  $-S'(T_i)(T_i - T_{i-1}) + o(T_i - T_{i-1})$   
=  $\lambda S(T_i)\Delta T + o(\Delta T)$  (9)

So

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} B(0, T_i)(S(T_{i-1}) - S(T_i))$$
$$= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \underbrace{B(0, T_i)S(T_i)}_{D(0, T_i)} \lambda(T_i) \Delta T$$
$$+ o(1) \stackrel{\Delta T \to 0}{\longrightarrow} \int_{0}^{T} dt \lambda \quad D(0, t) \qquad (10)$$

and

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} (T_i - T_{i-1}) D(0, T_i) \xrightarrow{\Delta T \to 0} \int_0^T \mathrm{d}t \, D(0, t) \quad (11)$$

Substituting in equation  $(5)$  we obtain the "triangle" relation

$$\text{CDS}(T) = (1 - \overline{R})\lambda$$

CDS spread =  $(1 - \text{recovery rate}) \times \text{hazard rate}$ 

The assumption of a flat term structure of hazard rates is rather crude, but this formula is very useful in practice to get an order of magnitude of the riskneutral default rate  $\lambda$  from CDS quotes.

## **Risk Management of Credit Default Swaps**

Various factors affect the mark-to-market value of a CDS position. On a day-to-day basis the main concern is *spread volatility*: the value of a CDS position is primarily affected by changes in the CDS spread. Fluctuations in CDS spreads tend to exhibit heavy tails and strong asymmetry (upward moves in spreads have a heavier tail than downward moves) at daily and weekly frequencies. Figure 5 shows the daily returns in the CDS spread of CIGNA Corp. from 2005 to 2009: note the large amplitude of daily returns, which can attain 20% or 30%, especially on the upside. These tails are exacerbated by the relative illiquidity of many single-name CDS contracts.

Another concern is obviously the occurrence of the underlying credit event, which results in large payouts, whose magnitude is linked to the recovery rate and is difficult to determine in advance.

To provision for these risks, typically one or both parties to a CDS contract must post collateral and there can be margin calls requiring the posting of additional collateral during the lifetime of the contract, if the quoted spread of the CDS contract or the credit rating of one of the parties changes.

Additionally, as with other OTC derivatives, CDSs are exposed to counterparty risk. The counterparty risk exposure can be particularly large in a scenario where the protection seller and the underlying entity default together. This can happen, for example, if the protection seller has insufficient reserves to cover CDS payments. Counterparty risk affects the CDS spread if the default of the protection seller and the reference entity are perceived to be correlated [6]. The AIG fiasco in 2008 and the default of Lehman exacerbated the market perception of counterparty risk and has since distorted the level of CDS spreads, making it imperative to account for counterparty risk in the risk management of CDS portfolios.

To mitigate counterparty risk in the CDS market, it has been proposed by various market participants and regulators to clear CDS trades in clearinghouses. In a clearinghouse, the central counterparty acts as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer, thereby isolating each participant from the default of other participants. Participants post collateral with the central counterparty and are subject to daily margin calls. The introduction of a CDS clearinghouse can also reduce systemic risk resulting from CDS

transactions [1]. In the United States the first CDS clearinghouse, ICE Trust, began operating in March 2009. Other proposals to clear credit default swaps have been made by CME, NYSE Euronext, Eurex AG, and LCH Clearnet.

## **Credit Default Swap (CDS) Basis**

An asset swap is a transaction between two parties in which the asset swap buyer purchases a bond from the other party and simultaneously enters into an interest rate swap transaction, usually with the same counterparty, to exchange the coupon on the bond for Libor plus a spread. The spread is called the *asset swap spread*. A common asset swap is the par asset swap where the buyer pays par at the inception of the deal. Unlike a CDS, an asset swap continues following bond default.

The *CDS-Bond basis* is the difference between the CDS spread and the asset swap spread on the same bond. It is an indicator of relative value of CDS *versus* the cash bond [2]. For example, when the CDS spread is higher than the asset swap spread, that is, the basis is positive, the CDS is generally considered to be more attractive than the bond. The reverse is true if the basis is negative. Negative CDS basis has been frequently observed during the recent financial crisis.

## **Changes in Conventions**

Since 2009, the CDS market has been evolving in the direction of trading standardized single-name contracts with an upfront payment and a fixed coupon of either 100 or 500 bp and a common set of coupon payment dates (see www.cdsmodel.com). Standard maturity dates are March/June/September/December 20. Coupon payment dates are like standard maturity dates, but are adjusted to fall on the following business day. Each coupon is equal to (annual coupon/360) × (number of days in accrual period). This simplifies processing and computation of coupons and cash flows. For example, every \$10 mm 100 bp standard CDS contract will pay the same 2Q09 coupon, \$26 111, on Monday, June 22, 2009, regardless of trade date, maturity, or reference entity.

The upfront payment is then set at the inception such that the buyer and seller positions have the same present value. In this convention, the dealer will quote not a spread (which is fixed) but an upfront payment. This convention applies to standardized CDS contracts on names contained in CDX and ITRAXX indices and may set the example for all other CDS contracts in the future.
