## **Generalized Hyperbolic** Models

that is,

$$d_{\text{GIG}(\lambda,\delta,\gamma)}(x) = \left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta}\right)^{\lambda} \frac{1}{2K_{\lambda}(\delta\gamma)} x^{\lambda-1}$$
$$\times \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\delta^{2}}{x} + \gamma^{2}x\right)\right) \mathbb{1}_{\{x>0\}}$$

Generalized hyperbolic (GH) Lévy motions constitute a subclass of Lévy processes that are generated by GH distributions. GH distributions were introduced in Barndorff-Nielsen [1] in connection with a project with geologists. The Lebesgue density of this five-parameter class can be given in the following form:

$$d_{\mathrm{GH}(\lambda,\alpha,\beta,\delta,\mu)}(x) = a(\lambda,\alpha,\beta,\delta,\mu)$$
$$\times (\delta^2 + (x-\mu)^2)^{\left(\lambda - \frac{1}{2}\right)/2}$$
$$\times K_{\lambda - \frac{1}{2}} \left(\alpha\sqrt{\delta^2 + (x-\mu)^2}\right)$$
$$\times \exp(\beta(x-\mu)) \tag{1}$$

with the norming constant

$$a(\lambda,\alpha,\beta,\delta,\mu) = \frac{(\alpha^2 - \beta^2)^{\lambda/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}\alpha^{\lambda - \frac{1}{2}}\delta^{\lambda}K_{\lambda}(\delta\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2})}$$
(2)

 $K_{\nu}$  denotes the modified Bessel function of the third kind with index  $\nu$ . The parameters can be interpreted as follows:  $\alpha > 0$  determines the shape,  $\beta$ with  $0 < |\beta| < \alpha$  the skewness and  $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$  the location.  $\delta > 0$  serves for scaling, and  $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$  characterizes subclasses. It is essentially the weight in the tails that changes with  $\lambda$ . There are two alternative parameterizations that are scale- and locationinvariant, that is, they do not change under affine transformations  $Y = aX + b$  for  $a \neq 0$ , namely,  $\zeta =$  $\delta\sqrt{\alpha^2-\beta^2}$ ,  $\rho=\beta/\alpha$  and  $\xi=(1+\zeta)^{-1/2}$ ,  $\chi=\xi\rho$ . Since  $0 \le |\chi| < \xi < 1$ , for a fixed  $\lambda$  the distributions parameterized by  $\chi$  and  $\xi$  can be represented by the points of a triangle, the so-called shape triangle.

GH distributions arise in a natural way as variance-mean mixtures of normal distributions. Let  $d_{\text{GIG}}$  denote the density of a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution (see Normal Inverse Gaussian **Model**) with parameters  $\delta > 0, \gamma > 0$ , and  $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ ,

Then if  $N(\mu + \beta y, y)$  denotes a normal distribution with mean  $\mu + \beta y$  and variance y, one can easily verify that

$$d_{\mathrm{GH}(\lambda,\alpha,\beta,\delta,\mu)}(x) = \int_0^\infty d_{N(\mu+\beta y,y)}(x) \times d_{\mathrm{GIG}(\lambda,\delta,\sqrt{\alpha^2-\beta^2})}(y) \, \mathrm{d}y \quad (4)$$

Using maximum likelihood estimation, one can fit GH distributions to empirical return distributions from financial time series such as the daily stock or index prices. Figure 1 shows a fit to the daily closing prices of Telekom over a period of seven years.

Figure 2 shows the same densities on a log scale in order to make the fit in the tails visible. One recognizes the hyperbolic shape of the GH density in comparison to the parabolic shape of the normal density. The characteristic function of the GH distribution is

$$\varphi_{\text{GH}}(u) = e^{\mathrm{i}u\mu} \left(\frac{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}{\alpha^2 - (\beta + \mathrm{i}u)^2}\right)^{\frac{\lambda}{2}} \times \frac{K_{\lambda} \left(\delta\sqrt{\alpha^2 - (\beta + \mathrm{i}u)^2}\right)}{K_{\lambda}(\delta\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2})} \tag{5}$$

and expectation and variance are

 $-2$   $-2$ 

$$E[GH] = \mu + \frac{\beta \delta^2}{\zeta} \frac{K_{\lambda+1}(\zeta)}{K_{\lambda}(\zeta)}$$
(6)

 $\sim 2 \times 4$ 

$$\text{Var}(GH) = \frac{\delta^2}{\zeta} \frac{K_{\lambda+1}(\zeta)}{K_{\lambda}(\zeta)} + \frac{\beta^2 \delta^4}{\zeta^2} \times \left(\frac{K_{\lambda+2}(\zeta)}{K_{\lambda}(\zeta)} - \frac{K_{\lambda+1}^2(\zeta)}{K_{\lambda}^2(\zeta)}\right) \tag{7}$$

 $\sim 10^{-1}$

The moment-generating function exists for all  $u$ such that  $-\alpha - \beta < u < \alpha - \beta$ . Therefore, moments of all orders are finite.

There are two important subclasses. For  $\lambda = 1$ , one gets the class of *hyperbolic* distributions with density

$$d_{H(\alpha,\beta,\delta,\mu)}(x) = \frac{\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}}{2\alpha\delta K_1 \left(\delta\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}\right)}$$
$$\times \exp\left(-\alpha\sqrt{\delta^2 + (x - \mu)^2} + \beta(x - \mu)\right) \tag{8}$$

whereas for  $\lambda = -\frac{1}{2}$  one gets the class of normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) distributions with density

$$d_{\text{NIG}(\alpha,\beta,\delta,\mu)}(x) = \frac{\alpha}{\pi} \exp\left(\delta\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2} + \beta(x-\mu)\right)$$
$$\times \frac{K_1 \left(\alpha\delta\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\delta}\right)^2}\right)}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\delta}\right)^2}}$$
(9)

The latter one has a particularly simple characteristic function:

$$\varphi_{\text{NIG}}(u) = e^{iu\mu} \frac{\exp\left(\delta\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}\right)}{\exp\left(\delta\sqrt{\alpha^2 - (\beta + iu)^2}\right)}$$
(10)

Many well-known distributions are limit cases of the class of GH distributions. For  $\lambda > 0$  and  $\delta \rightarrow 0$ , one gets a variance-gamma distribution; in the special case of  $\lambda = 1$  the result is a skewed and shifted Laplace distribution. Other limit cases are the Cauchy and the Student- $t$  distribution as well as the gamma, the reciprocal gamma, and the normal distributions [4].

## Exponential Lévy Models

GH distributions are infinitely divisible and therefore generate a Lévy process  $L = (L_t)_{t>0}$  such that the distribution of  $L_1$ ,  $\mathcal{L}(L_1)$ , is the given GH distribution. Analyzing the characteristic function in the Lévy-Khintchine form, one sees that the Lévy measure has an explicit density. There is no Gaussian component. Consequently the generated Lévy process is a process with purely discontinuous paths. The paths have infinite activity, which means that there are infinitely many jumps in any finite time interval (see Jump Processes; Exponential Lévy Models).

As a model for asset prices such as stock prices, indices, or foreign exchange rates, we take the exponential of the Lévy process  $L$ 

$$S_t = S_0 \exp L_t \tag{11}$$

For hyperbolic Lévy motions, this model was introduced in [6], NIG Lévy processes were considered in [2], and the extension to GH Lévy motions

appeared in [3, 8]. The log returns from this model taken along time intervals of length 1 are  $L_t - L_{t-1}$ and therefore they have exactly the GH distribution that generates the Lévy process. It was shown in  $[7]$  that the model  $(9)$  is successful in producing empirically correct distributions on other time horizons as well. This time consistency property can, for example, be used to derive the correct VaR estimates on a two-week horizon according to the Basel II rules. Equation  $(9)$  can be expressed by the following stochastic differential equation:

$$dS_t = S_{t-} (dL_t + e^{\Delta L_t} - 1 - \Delta L_t)$$
 (12)

The price of a European option with payoff  $f(S_T)$ is

$$V = e^{-rT} \mathbb{E}\left[f(S_T)\right] \tag{13}$$

where  $r$  is the interest rate and expectation is taken with respect to a risk-neutral (martingale) measure. As shown in [5], there are many equivalent martingale measures due to the rich structure of the driving process  $L$ . The simplest choice is the so-called Esscher transform, which was used in [6]. For the process  $L$  to be again a GH Lévy motion under an equivalent martingale measure (see **Equivalent Martingale Measures**), the parameters  $\delta$  and  $\mu$  have to be kept fixed [9]. Since the density of the distribution of  $S_T$  can be derived *via* inversion of the characteristic function, the expectation in equation  $(11)$  can be computed directly. A numerically much more efficient method based on two-sided Laplace transforms, which is applicable to a wide variety of options, has been developed in [9]. Assume that  $e^{-Rx} f(e^{-x})$  is bounded and integrable for some  $R$  such that the moment-generating function of  $L_T$  is finite at  $-R$ . Write  $g(x) = f(e^{-x})$  and  $\psi_g(z) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} e^{-zx} g(x) dx$  for the bilateral Laplace transform of *g*. If  $\zeta := -\log S_0$ , then the option price  $V$  can be expressed in the following form:

$$V(\zeta) = \frac{e^{\zeta R - rT}}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} e^{i u \zeta} \psi_g(R + i u) \varphi_{L_T}(i R - u) \, du$$

 $(14)$ 

whenever the integral exists.  $\varphi_{L_T}$  denotes the characteristic function of the distribution of  $L_T$ .
