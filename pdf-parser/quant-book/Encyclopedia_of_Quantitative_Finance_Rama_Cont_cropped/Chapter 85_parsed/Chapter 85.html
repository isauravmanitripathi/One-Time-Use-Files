    Forwards and Futures
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Futures and forwards are financial contracts that make it possible to reduce the price risk that arises from the intention to buy or sell certain assets at a later date. A forward contract specifies in advance the price that will be paid at such a later date for the delivery of the asset. This obviously reduces the price risk for that transaction to zero for all parties involved. A futures contract, on the other hand, guarantees that changes in the asset's price that occur before the delivery date will be compensated for immediately when they arise. This compensation is achieved by offsetting payments into a bank account that is called the
   <i>
    margin account
   </i>
   . This significantly reduces the price risk associated with the futures transaction, since the only possible remaining source of uncertainty is now due to the interest rate used for the margin account.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The assets that are bought or sold at the delivery date can be storable commodities (such as gold, oil, and agricultural products), nonstorable commodities (such as electricity), or other financial assets (such as stocks, bonds, options, or currencies). Forward contracts are also used by parties to agree in advance on an interest rate that will be paid or charged during a later time period, in so-called forward rate agreements (FRAs). Similarly, one can buy and sell futures on the value of money deposited in a bank account. For such interest rate futures, which include the very popular eurodollar and euribor contracts, there is no actual delivery but the contract is fulfilled by cash settlement instead.

   Here, we discuss only the general pricing principles for forwards and futures. We refer to other articles in the encyclopedia for detailed information concerning the delivery procedures and methods to quote prices for specific futures and forward contracts, such as eurodollar futures (

    Using Futures and Forwards
   </b>

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Forward contracts are usually agreed upon by two parties who directly negotiate the terms of such contracts, which can therefore be very flexible. The two
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   parties need to agree on the specific asset (often called
   <i>
    the underlying asset
   </i>
   ) and on the precise quantities that are bought or sold, on the exact date when the transactions take place (the
   <i>
    delivery date
   </i>
   ), and the price that will be charged on that date (the
   <i>
    forward price
   </i>
   ). Usually the forward price is chosen in such a way that both parties agree to sign the contract without any money changing hands before the delivery date. This implies that the forward contract starts with having zero market value, since both parties are willing to sign it without receiving or paying any money for it. Later on, the contract may have a positive or negative market value, since every change in the market price of the underlying asset will make the existing agreement as written in the contract more beneficial to one of the parties and less beneficial to the other one. The forward contract may, therefore, become a serious liability for one of the two parties involved, so there is the risk that this party is no longer willing or able to honor the terms of the contract on the delivery date. This counterparty risk problem can be avoided by the use of futures contracts.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Futures are standardized contracts that are traded on futures exchanges. When entering a futures contract, a margin account on the futures exchange is opened and a payment into that account is required, to make it possible for the exchange to withdraw money when appropriate. The exchange publishes a
   <i>
    futures price
   </i>
   for every contract, which is updated regularly to reflect price changes in the underlying. Whenever a new futures price is announced, an amount of cash that is equal to the difference between the new futures price and the previous one is paid into or withdrawn from the margin account, depending on whether one is
   <i>
    short
   </i>
   the contract or
   <i>
    long
   </i>
   the contract. Parties that intend to buy the underlying are long the contract, and they, therefore, receive money if the futures price goes up and pay when it goes down. Parties that intend to sell are short the contract, and they, therefore, pay money if the futures price goes down and receive money when it goes up. This procedure is known as
   <i>
    marking to market
   </i>
   . Since on the delivery date the futures price is always equal to the underlying asset price, a possible difference between the initial futures price and the current asset price has been compensated for by the intermediate payments into the margin account.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Parties with opposite positions in the futures market deal only with the exchange instead of with each other, which explains the need for standardized
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   contracts and the significant reduction in counterparty risk. Since no cash is needed to enter into a new (long or short) futures contract as long as there is enough money left in the margin account, it is easy to change a position in futures once such an account has been established. One can terminate existing long contracts by simply taking a position in offsetting short contracts or
   <i>
    vice versa
   </i>
   , and many parties close their position just before the delivery date if they are only interested in compensation for price changes and not in the actual delivery. This makes futures very convenient to use for hedging purposes (see
   <b>
    Hedging
   </b>
   ) and for speculation on an underlying's price movements. Likewise, it is quite easy for the exchange to close the futures position of a party who refuses to put more money in their margin account when asked to do so in the so-called margin call.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   These characteristics have made futures very popular financial instruments and the market for them is huge. In 2008, more than eight billion futures contracts were traded worldwide with underlying assets&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; in equity indices

   , interest rates (18%), agricultural goods (5%), energy (3%), currencies (3%), and metals (2%). The most popular are contracts on the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones indices, followed by eurodollar and eurobund futures, and contracts on white sugar, soybeans, crude oil, aluminum, and gold. The notional amounts underlying futures on interest rates, equity indices, and currencies at the world's exchanges were estimated to be 27 trillion, 1.6 trillion, and 175 billion US dollars, respectively, in June

   To analyze the futures and forward prices, we first look at discrete-time models, and then look at generalizations in continuous time.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Consider a discrete-time market model on a probability space
   <math display="inline">

   and

   to model the underlying asset and a bank account, respectively, with associated stochastic price processes

   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    (B_n)_{n\in\mathcal{N}}
   </math>
   . We assume that
   <math display="inline">
    S
   </math>
   is adapted and that
   <math display="inline">
    B

   is predictable with respect to this filtration, and that both
   <math display="inline">

   are bounded. Associated with the asset S are cash flows
   <math display="inline">
    (D_n)_{n\in\mathcal{N}}

   where
   <math display="inline">

  <p block-type="Text">
   time
   <math display="inline">

   . These cash flows can be positive (such as dividends when
   <math display="inline">

   is a stock, or interest when
   <math display="inline">
    S

   is a commodity). We will always assume perfect market liquidity (see
   <b>
    Liquidity
   </b>
   ), so all assets can be bought and sold in all possible quantities for their current market prices and no transaction costs (see Transaction Costs) are charged.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The cash flows associated with a forward contract that is initiated at time

   that is specified in the contract, with

    T_0 \leq T_d

   <math display="inline">
    T_d

    T_0

   for delivery at time
   <math display="inline">
    T_d
   </math>
   , which we denote by
   <math display="inline">
    F(T_0, T_d)
   </math>
   , is paid in return. Since this forward price needs to be determined at time
   <math display="inline">
    T_0
   </math>
   , it should be
   <math display="inline">
    \mathcal{F}_{T_0}

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   In complete and arbitrage-free markets (see Arbi

   ), it is often possible to find an explicit expression for the forward price
   <math display="inline">
    F(T_0, T_d)
   </math>
   , since the cash flows associated with the contract can then be replicated using other assets with known prices. Let us assume that there exists a unique martingale measure
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{Q}
   </math>
   , which is equivalent to
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{P}
   </math>
   , such that the discounted versions of tradable assets are martingales under this measure (see
   <b>
    Equivalent Martingale Measures

   In particular, when there are no dividends or storage costs, the forward price is simply equal to the current price of the underlying asset divided by the appropriate discount rate until delivery. For commodities, where the cash flows
   <i>
    Dn
   </i>
   are often negative since they represent storage costs, this formula (3) is known as the
   <i>
    cost-of-carry formula
   </i>
   . Conversely, when the actual possession of an underlying asset is more beneficial than just holding the forward contract, this can be modeled by introducing positive cash flows
   <i>
    Dn
   </i>
   . Such benefits are often expressed as a rate, the so-called convenience yield, which may fluctuate as a result of changing expectations concerning the availability of the underlying asset on the delivery date.

   For clarity of exposition, we have focused here on forward and future prices in complete and arbitragefree markets without transaction costs (see Transaction Costs). Early papers on the theoretical pricing methods are by Black [3] for deterministic interest rates and Cox et al. [5] and Jarrow and Oldfield [9] for the general case. Continuous resettlement is

   treated by Duffie and Stanton [7] and Karatzas and Shreve [10], see also [12]. See [2] for a very clear summary of the principles involved. For excellent introductions to the practical organization of futures and forward markets and for empirical results on prices, the books by Duffie [6], Hull [8], and Kolb [11] are recommended.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   For incomplete markets, there is a theory of equilibrium in futures market under mean-variance preferences; see, for example, [14] and the consumption-based capital asset pricing model of Breeden [4] (
   <i>
    see also
   </i>
   <b>
    Capital Asset Pricing Model
   </b>
   ). Many futures allow a certain flexibility regarding the exact product that must be delivered and regarding the time of delivery. The value of this last "timing option" is analyzed in a paper by Biagini and Biörk [1].

  <p block-type="Text">
   When the bank account process
   <math display="inline">
    B
   </math>
   is not of finite variation and continuous, the futures price is no longer a martingale under
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{Q}
   </math>
   ; however under some technical conditions, it can be shown to be a martingale under another equivalent measure that can be found using a multiplicative Doob-Meyer decomposition (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Doob–Meyer Decomposition
