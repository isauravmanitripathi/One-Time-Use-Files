Today the formula is more commonly derived using the Ito formula and the option replication idea introduced by Merton [17].

Little, Inc. Fischer had never taken a single course in economics or finance, nor did he ever do so subsequently. Nevertheless, the field was underdeveloped at the time, and Fischer managed to set himself up as a financial consultant and to parlay his success in that capacity into a career in academia (University of Chicago 1971–1975, Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1975–1984), and then into a partnership at the Wall Street investment firm of Goldman Sachs (1984–1995). There can be no doubt that his early success with the options pricing formula opened these doors. The more important point is how, in each of these settings, Fischer used the opportunity he had been given to help promote his vision of a CAPM future for the financial side of the economy.</p>",

In such a world, everyone holds the fully diversified market portfolio of equity and then adjusts risk exposure by borrowing or lending in the market for risk-free debt. As equity values fluctuate, outstanding debt also fluctuates, as people adjust their portfolios to maintain desired risk exposure. One implication of CAPM, therefore, is that there should be a market for passively managed index mutual funds [15]. Another implication is that the regulatory apparatus surrounding banking, both lending and deposit taking, should be drastically relaxed to facilitate dynamic adjustment of risk exposure [3]. And yet a third implication is that there might be a role for an automatic risk rebalancing instrument, essentially what is known today as <i>portfolio insurance</i> [6, 13].</p>",

Just as risk is the price we pay for higher expected yield, business fluctuation is also the price we pay for higher expected rates of economic growth.</p>",

A system of banking institutions was replaced by a system of capital markets, as financial engineering developed ways to turn loans into bonds. This revolution in institutions has also brought with it a revolution in our thinking about how the economy works, including the role of government regulation and stabilization policy. Crises in the old banking system gave rise to the old macroeconomics. Crises in the new capital markets system will give rise to a new macroeconomics, possibly built on the foundations laid by Fischer Black.</p>",
