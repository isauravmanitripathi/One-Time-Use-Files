    Structural Default Risk
   </b>
   Models
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Structural models of default risk for individual firms originate from the seminal work of Merton [25]. Default is linked to the economic fundamentals of the considered firm via the assumption that default occurs if the value of the firm's assets, modeled as a geometric Brownian motion, falls below some default threshold (the firm's liabilities) at some future point in time (the maturity of a zero-coupon bond). A significant extension of this methodology was proposed by Black and Cox [7], who continuously test for default. Hence, in their model, the time of default is a first-passage time. Further generalizations address stochastic interest rates, more general assumptions on the default threshold, the definition of the default event, and discontinuous processes as model for the firm's assets [10, 12, 20-22, 34]. On a high level, these innovations aim at making the model-induced term structure of default probabilities flexible enough to allow for a precise fit of the model to observed bond prices and credit default swap (CDS) spreads.

  <p block-type="Text">
   The growing popularity of derivatives on credit portfolios, for example, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and
   <math display="inline">
    n
   </math>
   th to default baskets, and advanced demands on risk-management solutions produced a need for portfolio models that simultaneously explain the credit quality of multiple firms. Since corporate defaults in a globalized economy are not independent, a multivariate default model has to explain univariate default probabilities and the dependence among the default events. A natural assumption for a multivariate structural-default model is to introduce dependence by assuming correlated asset values, leading to dependent default events. Zhou [33] motivates this approach by the observation: "The fortunes of individual companies are linked together via industry-specific and/or general economic conditions." The first portfolio model of this class was formulated by Vasicek [31] and can be classified as a multivariate generalization of the work by Merton [25]. This model is discussed in some detail in the section "The Model of Vasicek", as it constitutes the basis for most of today's generalizations and is used to asses the regulatory capital for loan portfolios within the Basel II framework.

   A major advantage of (multivariate) structuraldefault models is the appealing economic interpretation of the definition of default. Additionally, comovements of the individual firm-value processes might also be interpreted as being the result of common risk factors. Moreover, modeling the evolution of the firm's values as some multivariate stochastic process naturally implies a dynamic model, which is highly desirable in risk-management and pricing applications. The downside of this class of models is the mathematical challenge of computing the portfolio-loss distribution or even bivariate default correlations. Hence, most of the proposed models rely on simplifying assumptions or can be solved only

   In his short memo [31], Vasicek considers a portfolio of
   <math display="inline">
    n
   </math>
   loans with unit nominal and maturity
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   . Each individual firm-value process is modeled as a geometric Brownian motion defined by the stochastic differential equation:

   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The first simplification, often referred to as
   <i>
    homo
   </i>
   geneous portfolio assumption, is to assume identical default probabilities for all firms. In the current setup, this assumption corresponds to identical parameters
   <math display="inline">
    V_0 \equiv V_0^i

    T
   </math>
   , since the distribution of the firm value at time
   <math display="inline">

   is known explicitly. Moreover, since default can only happen at maturity, only the distribution of
   <math display="inline">

   is of importance and not the dynamic model leading to it. By scaling the
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   original default threshold, default can alternatively be expressed in terms of the standard normally distributed variable
   <math display="inline">
    X^i

   plays a major role in today's regulatory world. The core of the first pillar of the Basel II accord [4] is the internal rating-based (IRB) approach for calculating capital requirements for loan portfolios. Within this framework, banks classify their loans by asset class and credit quality into homogeneous buckets and use their own internal rating systems to estimate risk characteristics such as loss-given default (LGD), the expected exposure at default (EAD), and the oneyear default probability (PD), that is,
   <math display="inline">
    PD = p_1
   </math>
   . It is worth mentioning that estimating LGD and PD independently contradicts the empirical observation that recovery rates and default rates are inversely related; see, for example, [2] and [11]. Still, banks are free to choose a certain internal rating system, as long as they can demonstrate its accuracy and meet certain data requirements. In the second step, these credit characteristics are used in the IRB formula to asses the minimum capital requirements for the unexpected loss via the factor

  <h4>
   Generalizations Using Other Distributions
  </h4>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   It is well known that the model [31] does not yield a satisfactory fit to market quotes of tranches of CDOs. More precisely, an implied correlation smile is present when the model is inverted for the correlation parameter tranche by tranche. Especially tail events with multiple defaults are underrepresented in a Gaussian world, making a precise fit to senior tranches of a CDO impossible. To overcome this shortcoming, a natural assumption is to give up normality in equation (3) and consider other heavier tailed distributions. For the derivation leading to
   <math display="inline">
    F_{p,\rho}^{\infty}
   </math>
   in equation (7), the stability of the normal distribution under convolutions is essential in equation (3). Hence, natural choices for generalizations are other infinitely divisible distributions, which are connected to Lévy processes; see, for example, [8]. These generalizations add flexibility to the model and can additionally imply a dependence structure with tail dependence, making multiple defaults more likely. Specific models in this spirit include, for example, the NIG model of Kalemanova et al. [17], the VG model of Moosbrucker [27], and the BVG model of Baxter [6]. Following [1], we now derive a large homogeneous portfolio approximation in a general Lévy framework.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   expected jump size
   <math display="inline">
    \nu = \mathbb{E}[\Pi - 1]
   </math>
   . The advantage of supporting negative jumps on a univariate level is that default events are no longer predictable, which translates to positive short-term credit spreads. Willemann [32] incorporates dependence to the individual firm-value processes by the classical decomposition of each Brownian motion into a market factor and an idiosyncratic component. Moreover, it is assumed that all firm-value processes jump together, that is, all processes are driven by the same Poisson process
   <math display="inline">
    N_t
   </math>
   . Consequently, this construction allows for two layers of correlation: diffusion and jump correlation; the latter being the main innovation of this setup.

   <math display="inline">

   </math>
   . This declining form is chosen to increase short-term spreads, but might also imply that the fit to individual CDS gets worse with increase in time. To achieve semianalytical results for the portfolio-loss distribution, default is tested on a grid. The advantage of this simplification is that only the distribution of each firm-value process at the grid points is required, instead of functionals as
   <math display="inline">
    \inf_{s\in[0,t]} V_s
   </math>
   . Individual default probabilities up to time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   can then be computed conditional on the number of jumps up to time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   , which is a Poisson-distributed random variable. Since the specific choice of jump-size distribution is compatible to the Brownian motion of the model, this leads to an infinite sum of normally distributed random variables. Moreover, all default events are independent conditional on the market factor and the number of jumps. Hence, the portfolioloss distribution can be found by integrating out these common factors and using a recursion technique similar to [3, 16]. Willemann [32] demonstrates quite successfully how the model is simultaneously fitted (in seconds) to individual CDS spreads and the tranches of a CDO.

   A Remark on Asset and Default Correlation
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Modeling asset values as correlated stochastic processes introduces dependence to the resulting default times. Still, this relation is not trivial and deserves some caution, especially when it comes to estimating the model's asset-correlation parameter. We follow
   <math display="inline">
    [24]
   </math>
   in defining the default correlation of two firms (up to time

   </math>
   , the probability of a joint default of both firms up to time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   , is quite difficult; an exception being the case of two companies with Gaussian factors coupled as described in equation (3). This example is, therefore, used to illustrate the nonlinear relation of asset and default correlation. A joint default in this setup corresponds to a simultaneous drop of both factors
   <math display="inline">

   and

   Being able to convert default to asset correlations (and
   <i>
    vice versa
   </i>
   ) opens the possibility of estimating the model's asset correlation using historical default correlations (and vice versa); see, for example, [14]. This approach is relevant since asset values are not directly observable, making an estimation of asset correlations delicate. It is an ongoing debate whether indirectly observed changes in asset values, computed from changes in the respective firm's equity, or observed defaults are the better source of data for the estimation of the model's correlation parameter. In both cases, pointing out the respective limitations is much simpler than providing theoretical evidence for the methodology. Empirically estimating default correlations (based on groups of firms with similar characteristics) requires a large set of observations, since corporate defaults are rare events. This makes the approach vulnerable to structural changes such as new bankruptcy rules. On the other hand, daily equity prices are readily available for most firms. When this latter source of data is used, the difficulty lies in transforming equity to asset returns, see, for example, [9], from which the correlation might be estimated. In addition, one should be aware that equity prices might change for reasons that are not related to credit risk.

    First-passage Time Models
   </b>
  </h2>

   The starting point for most multivariate first passagetime models is equation (1). Compared to models in the spirit of the work by Merton [25], the time of default is now defined as suggested in

    [7]
   </math>
   , that is,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">

   . From a modeling perspective, this definition overcomes the unrealistic assumption of default being restricted to maturity. This observation is even more crucial in a portfolio environment when bonds with different maturities are monitored simultaneously. More precisely, a first-passage model naturally induces a dynamic model for the default correlation (since the firm-value processes evolve dynamically over time) and allows the computation of consistent default correlations over any time horizon.

   However, the main drawback of this model class is its computational intractability. This stems from
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   the fact that the joint distribution of the minimum of several firm-value processes is required, which is already a challenging problem for univariate marginals. The following section collects models where analytical results or numerical routines are available to overcome this problem.

  <h3>
   The Model of Zhou
  </h3>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Zhou studies [33] a portfolio of two firms whose asset-value processes are modeled as in equation (1) with correlated Brownian motions. The default thresholds are assumed to be exponential, that is,
   <math display="inline">
    d_t^i = e^{\lambda^i t} K^i
   </math>
   for
   <math display="inline">
    i \in \{1, 2\}
   </math>
   . The degree of dependence of both firms is measured in terms of their
   <i>
    default correlation
   </i>
   up to time
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   , that is, as
   <math display="inline">
    \text{Cor}(\mathbf{1}_{\{\tau^1 \le t\}}, \mathbf{1}_{\{\tau^2 \le t\}})
   </math>
   . The key observation is that results of Rebholz [28] can be applied to give an analytical representation of the default correlation in terms of an infinite sum of indefinite integrals over modified Bessel functions. Sensitivity analysis of the model parameters indicates that the model-induced default correlations for short maturities are close to zero. This observation needs to be considered when portfolio derivatives with short maturities are priced within such a framework.

  <h3>
   The Model of Giesecke
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Giesecke [13] considers a portfolio of
   <math display="inline">
    n
   </math>
   firms whose value processes evolve according to some vector-valued stochastic process
   <math display="inline">
    (V^1, \ldots, V^n)
   </math>
   , where default is again defined as in equation (20). The key innovation is to replace the vector of default thresholds by an initially unobservable random vector
   <math display="inline">
    (d^1,\ldots,d^n)
   </math>
   whose dependence structure is represented by some copula. It is shown that the modelinduced copula of default times is a function of the copula of default thresholds and the copula of the vector of historical lows of the firm-value processes.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   On a univariate level, the assumption of an unobservable random threshold overcomes the predictability of individual defaults, which is responsible for vanishing credit spreads for short maturities; see [10] for a related model. Short-term spreads [13] are positive as long as the respective firm-value process is close to its historical low. The consequence of this construction on a portfolio level is also remarkable. Observing a corporate default
   <math display="inline">
    \tau^i

   reveals the respective default threshold
   <math display="inline">
    d^i

   to all investors. This
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   piece of information allows to update the knowledge on all other default thresholds, leading to contagious jumps in credit spreads of the remaining firms. Giesecke [13] also presents an explicit example of two firms with independent value processes modeled as geometric Brownian motions and default thresholds coupled via a Clayton copula. While this simplified example illustrates the desired contagion effect of the model, it also highlights the challenge of finding analytic results in a realistic framework.

   Models Relying on Monte Carlo Simulations
  </h4>

   This section briefly presents two first-passage time models that rely on Monte Carlo simulations for the pricing of CDOs.

  <p block-type="Text">
   The
   <math display="inline">
    n
   </math>
   firm-value processes [15] are defined as in equation (1): the model can therefore be considered as a generalization of Zhou's [33] bivariate model to larger portfolios. The default thresholds are rewritten in terms of the driving Brownian motions. Asset correlation is introduced by
   <math display="inline">

    F^{j}

    U^i
   </math>
   are independent Brownian motions. Hull et al. [15] also consider extensions to stochastic correlations, stochastic recovery rates, and stochastic volatilities and compare these in terms of their fitting capability to CDO tranches. An interesting conclusion that also applies to similar first-passage time models is drawn when the model is compared to a copula model. It is argued that the default environment in a copula model is static for the whole life of the model, while the dynamic nature of equation (21) allows to have bad default environments in one year, followed by good environments later. Hence, the use of one or more common risk factors implies a sound economic model for cyclical correlation.

As a result of common jumps, the model allows for default clusters that extend the cyclical correlation induced by common continuous factors. For this choice of jump distribution, the marginals of the model can be calibrated to CDS quotes using the Laplace transform of first-passage times of
   <math display="inline">
    X^i

  <h2>
   Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Structural-default models allow for an appealing interpretation of corporate default: companies operate as long as they have sufficient assets. A clear economic interpretation also holds for the way dependence is introduced to a portfolio of companies: comovements of the firm-value processes might be seen as the result of common risk factors, to which economic interpretations might also apply. This rationale can also be used to empirically estimate the correlation structure of the model from market data. Summarizing, the dependence structure and univariate marginals are simultaneously explained. Moreover, since each company is modeled explicitly, called
   <i>
    bottom-up approach
   </i>
   , it is also possible to price portfolio derivatives and individual risk consistently; a major advantage over
   <i>
    top-down models
   </i>
   that purely focus on the portfolio-loss process. In addition, the current asset level might be mapped to some credit rating, implying a dynamic model of rating changes including default. Finally, the dynamic nature of the modeled firm-value processes translates to a dynamic model for the default correlation and
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   the portfolio-loss process; a desired property in riskmanagement solutions and for the pricing of (exotic) credit-portfolio derivatives.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The downside of multivariate structural-default models lies in the difficulty of translating the model to analytical formulas for default correlations and the portfolio-loss distribution. This becomes especially apparent when the simplifying assumption in [31] and its generalizations are reconsidered; the bottomup nature of structural-default models is entirely given up in order to compute the portfolio-loss distribution in closed form. The price to pay for a more realistic framework typically is a Monte Carlo simulation. However, if such a simulation is efficiently implemented, a realistic dynamic model for a portfolio of credit-risky assets is available.
