    Term Structure Models

  <p block-type="Text">
   <i>
    Term structure models
   </i>
   describe the behavior of interest rates as a function of time and term (time to maturity). As a function of time, rates behave as stochastic processes (see Figure 1). As a function of term, interest rates on a given date form a
   <i>
    yield curve
   </i>
   (see Figure 2).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Interest rates of different maturities behave as a joint stochastic process. Not all joint processes, however, can describe interest-rate behavior in an efficient market. For instance, suppose that a term structure model postulates that rates of all maturities change in time by equal amounts, that is, that yield curves move by parallel shifts (which, empirically, appears to be a reasonable first-order approximation). It can be shown that in this case a portfolio consisting of a long bond and a short bond would always outperform a medium-term bond with the same Macaulay duration (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Bond
   </b>
   ). In an efficient market, supply and demand would drive the price of the medium maturity bond down and the prices of the long and short bonds up. As this would cause the yield on the medium bond to increase and the yields on the long and short bonds to decrease, the yield curves would not stay parallel. This model therefore cannot describe interest-rate behavior.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In order that riskless arbitrage opportunities are absent, the joint process of interest-rate behavior must satisfy some conditions. Determining these conditions and finding processes that satisfy them is the purpose of term structure models.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The joint stochastic process will be driven by a number of sources of uncertainty. For continuous processes, the sources of uncertainty are often specified as Wiener processes. If the evolution of the yield curve can be represented by Markovian state variables, these variables are called

  <p block-type="Text">
   A general theory of one-factor term structure models was given by Vasicek [9]. He assumed the following:
  </p>
  <p block-type="ListGroup">
   <ul>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     1. The short rate follows a continuous Markov process.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     2. The price
     <i>
      B(t, T )
     </i>
     of a bond is determined by the assessment at time
     <i>
      t
     </i>
     of the segment {
     <i>
      r(τ ), t

     ≤
     <i>
      τ

     ≤
     <i>
      T
     </i>
     } of the short-rate process over the term of the bond.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     3. The market is efficient; that is, there are no transaction costs, information is available to all investors simultaneously, and every investor acts rationally (prefers more wealth to less, and uses all available information).
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Assumption 3 implies that investors have homogeneous expectations and that no profitable riskless arbitrage is possible.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   By assumption 1, the development of the short rate over an interval (

   ),

   ≤
   <i>

   <i>
    t

   is a function of

   Interest rates are Gaussian. The advantage of this specification is its tractability. A drawback is that interest rates can become negative.

   Hull and White [8] extended these two models by allowing the parameters in equations

   and
   <math display="inline">
    (13)
   </math>
   , as well as the market price of risk, to be time dependent. This has the advantage that the model can be made consistent with initial data. For instance, by making
   <math display="inline">
    \theta
   </math>
   a function of time, the model can be made to exactly fit the initial term structure of interest rates (which is not possible with time-homogeneous models). Similarly, making the volatility
   <math display="inline">
    \varphi
   </math>
   a function of time allows calibration of the model to the term structure of swaption volatilities. Hull and White give closed-form solutions for bond prices for what they call the extended Vasicek and the extended Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models. These cases belong to the class of models that Duffie and Kan [4] call the affine term structure models (see Affine Models), in which bond prices have the form

   In this model, bond prices cannot be given in closed-form formulas, but can be calculated numerically. Interest rates are lognormal. Lognormal models have regularity issues, for example, they produce infinite Eurodollar future prices (see

   The term structure theory generalizes easily to multiple factors and multiple sources of uncertainty. In fact, the bond pricing equation (9) is universally valid for any arbitrage-free term structure model. If
   <math display="inline">
    W, \varphi, \lambda

  <p block-type="Text">
   One of the main tasks of term structure models in applications is pricing of
   <i>
    interest-rate-contingent
   </i>
   claims (interest-rate derivatives). This could be approached in several ways. For one-factor models it can be shown, by means of an arbitrage argument similar to that above for bonds, that the price
   <math display="inline">
    P(t)
   </math>
   of any interest-rate derivative satisfies the partial differential equation
   <math display="inline">
    (8)
   </math>
   . The valuation of the derivative is then accomplished by solving that equation subject to boundary conditions that describe the derivative asset payouts. If a closed-form solution cannot be given, the equation can be solved numerically in a tree or a finite difference lattice. A more general method is to realize that such a solution has the form
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
