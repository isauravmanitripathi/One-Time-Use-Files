However, a variety of market frictions, including trading costs and constraints on short selling, exist in actual markets. It is important for market participants to accurately estimate and incorporate the impact of trading costs. For portfolio managers and investors, implementing investment decisions is costly and will typically lead to a shortfall in investment performance [26] relative to that theoretically attainable in frictionless markets. Decisions need to be conditioned not only on the fundamental soundness of potential investments but also on the anticipated costs of implementing the required trades. Estimates of trading costs also serve as a measure of market quality, allowing policy makers to assess the impact of regulatory reforms and exchange officials to assess the effects of trading rule and market structure changes, and informing corporate managers' decisions on where to list their shares. This article provides an overview of several issues related to measuring trading costs in financial markets. It focuses on three related measures of trading costs: quoted spreads, effective spreads, and realized spreads.</p>",

The seminal paper using this approach is [21]. The intuition is that noninformational transaction costs should result only in a <i>temporary</i> deviation of price from value, evidenced by a price reversal after the trade. In other words, while customer purchases (sales) should occur at prices above (below) pretrade value, we should subsequently observe a partial reversal of the price change. The price reversal is partial rather than full because the informational component of trading costs is, on average, associated with a <i>permanent</i> increase (decrease) in security value after buys (sells). The informational component can be measured by the change in the estimate of security value, while the noninformational component can be measured by the reversal from trade price to posttrade value.</p>",

Their algorithm assigns trades completed at prices above (below) the prevailing quote midpoint as buyer (seller) initiated trades. Trades executed at the quote midpoint are classified on the basis of a \"tick test\". The tick test assigns a trade as a buy (sell) if the trade executes at a higher (lower) price as compared to the most recent trade at a different price. An alternative algorithm is proposed by Ellis, Michaely and O'Hara [11], who assign trades executed at the ask (bid) quote as buyer (seller) initiated, while using the tick test for all other trades. On the basis of proprietary order level data, prior research finds that the algorithm proposed by Lee and Ready [24] works fairly well, classifying about 85% of the trades correctly.a Error rates are slightly lower for the algorithm proposed by Ellis, Michaely and O'Hara [11] (see [2] and [12]).</p>",

Pretrade price impact will tend to arise when larger orders are broken into smaller orders and executed successively. Prices may also move away from a trader because his trading intentions are detected by market participants who then \"front run\" the order or engage in \"predatory trading\" [7], or simply infer information from the existence of the trading interest. In addition, prices will tend to move away from traders relying on momentum strategies. Executing a trading program too slowly exposes traders to the risk of larger pretrade price impacts. On the other hand, executing orders that are larger than quote sizes too quickly may result in larger effective spreads. The skill of a trader handling larger orders lies in balancing these effects. To capture the impact of trader's \"timing\" and \"liquidity\" decisions, Perold [26] recommends that the average of the prevailing bid and ask quote at the time of the trading decision be used as the pretrade benchmark price.</p>",

If the period after the trade time is too short, temporary price effects may still dominate, or alternately, the market may not have had a chance to assess the trade's likely information content. If the period is too long, the measure will become unnecessarily noisy because of the arrival of extraneous information. In the absence of theoretical guidance, studies have used different proxies for the posttrade benchmark price. Studies using institutional data have often used the closing price on the day of trade as the posttrade price [20]. The practitioner literature commonly relies on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) on the day of the trade. Among datasets with broad coverage, Huang and Stoll [17] use the first trade price both 5 and 30 min after the trade, while Bessembinder and Kaufman [3] use the quote midpoint 30 min and 24 h after the trade. Bessembinder [2] used the midquote in effect 30 min after the time of the reference quote, or the 4 p.m.-quotation for trades completed during the last half hour of trading. Werner [32] reports that realized spread measures obtained in large samples are relatively insensitive to the choice of the posttrade benchmark price.</p>",

The intent of SEC Rule 605 (formerly 11Ac1-5) is to provide traders with information on execution quality at different market centers. The execution quality measures that each market now reports include round-trip effective spreads, realized spreads, as well as average execution speed. The regulation provides something of an official validation of the effective spread and realized spread measures described above, and also codifies a specific methodology to estimate trading costs based on the order level data available to each market center. Specifically, the effective spread compares the traded price to the quote midpoint (as a proxy for <i>Vit</i>) at order arrival, while the realized spread is based on the quote midpoint (as a proxy for <i>Vit</i><sup>+</sup><i>n</i>) 5 min after the trade.</p>",

He estimates that quoted spreads on Dow Jones stocks were in the range of 0.60% for sustained periods until the beginning of 1980s, with spikes in spreads observed during market downturns, such as the Great Depression. He documents that during the last two decades trading costs have fallen dramatically to around 0.20% for Dow stocks, partly facilitated by regulation but mainly by increased competition among market centers with the onset of electronic trading systems (see [15] for recent evidence).</p>",

For example, Venkataraman [31] reports that effective spread for large firms traded on the Paris Bourse were 0.25% in 1997, relative to 0.21% for comparable firms on NYSE. Jain [18] reports on trading costs during the year 2000 for liquid firms on 51 stock exchanges around the world. The average effective (realized) spread across exchanges is 2.13% (2.15%). However, there is considerable variation in effective (realized) spreads across markets, ranging from 0.10% (0.25%) at the NYSE (Luxembourg) to 14.47% (14.6%) in Ukraine. Research indicates that differences in execution quality across markets are related to both exchange-design features, such as tick size and order handling rules, and the regulatory environment, such as the enforcement of insider trading laws and the protection of shareholder rights [5, 10].</p>",

Execution costs arise because it is costly to provide liquidity, including order processing costs, inventory holding costs, and losses suffered to better-informed traders. Trading costs can be estimated on the basis of comparisons of trade prices with proxies for underlying security value, the most common proxy being quote midpoints. Comparisons can be of trade prices to midpoints at or before the time of the trade, as in effective spread measures, or to midpoints after the trade, as in realized spread measures. Further, the amount of asymmetric information present in a market can be estimated by assessing trades' price impact, measured as the difference between post- and pretrade estimates of security value. Recent research indicates that trade execution costs have declined steadily in US markets in recent years, particularly subsequent to decimalization in 2001, and documents substantial variation in average trading costs across international equity markets.</p>",
