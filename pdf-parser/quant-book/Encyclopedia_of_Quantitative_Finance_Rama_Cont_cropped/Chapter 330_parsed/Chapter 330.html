    Bid–Ask Spreads

  <p block-type="Text">
   The literature on asset pricing often assumes an ideal world where security prices are set by market participants in
   <i>
    frictionless
   </i>
   financial markets. However, a variety of market frictions, including trading costs and constraints on short selling, exist in actual markets. It is important for market participants to accurately estimate and incorporate the impact of trading costs. For portfolio managers and investors, implementing investment decisions is costly and will typically lead to a shortfall in investment performance [26] relative to that theoretically attainable in frictionless markets. Decisions need to be conditioned not only on the fundamental soundness of potential investments but also on the anticipated costs of implementing the required trades. Estimates of trading costs also serve as a measure of market quality, allowing policy makers to assess the impact of regulatory reforms and exchange officials to assess the effects of trading rule and market structure changes, and informing corporate managers' decisions on where to list their shares. This article provides an overview of several issues related to measuring trading costs in financial markets. It focuses on three related measures of trading costs: quoted spreads, effective spreads, and realized spreads.

  <h1>
   <b>
    The Nature of Trading Costs
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A fundamental issue in trading is the asynchronous arrival of buyers and sellers [9]. This creates uncertainty as to the amount of time that will be required to locate a counterparty, and regarding the market price that will prevail at the time a trading partner is located. This uncertainty can be mitigated by the continual presence of "liquidity suppliers", who stand ready to serve as counterparties, thereby providing immediacy of trade execution, that is, "liquidity". Liquidity suppliers often take the form of designated market makers or dealers, but liquidity can also be provided by traders in the form of limit orders.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Liquidity providers need to be compensated for the costs involved. Besides order processing costs, dealers incur inventory holding and adverse selection costs. Accommodating investors' order flows generally leaves dealers holding inventory positions that are not optimal in terms of the diversification of risk

  <p block-type="Text">
   [16] (

   </i>
   <b>
    Inventory Effects
   </b>
   ). Further, dealers need to be compensated for the possibility that some buy or sell orders can originate with traders possessing superior information regarding security value. Dealers, on average, lose money on transactions with betterinformed traders [13, 22] (see
   <b>
    Glosten–Milgrom Models
   </b>
   ;
   <b>
    Kyle Model
   </b>
   ), who sell to dealers ahead of price declines and buy from dealers ahead of price increases.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Dealers recover these costs by purchasing at a lower "bid" price, while selling at a higher "ask" (or "offer") price. The bid and ask prices are the dealer's quoted prices or "quotes", and the difference between the two is the bid–ask or quoted spread, a measure of trading cost. The corresponding quantities offered by the dealers at the quoted prices are referred to as the
   <i>
    quoted depth
   </i>
   , that is, the
   <i>
    bid depth
   </i>
   and the
   <i>
    ask depth
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In most financial markets, including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq Stock Market, liquidity provision by designated dealers is augmented by standing limit orders submitted by public traders. A limit order to buy sets a maximum price to be paid, while a limit order to sell sets a minimum price that will be accepted. A limit order may be viewed as a one-sided quote. Some markets (e.g., The Hong Kong Stock Exchange) operate without designated dealers, in which case, the bid–ask spread is determined by the most aggressively priced unexecuted limit orders. In summary, the bid–ask spread, which measures trading costs for investors buying at the ask and selling at the bid, arises to compensate liquidity providers for order processing, inventory, and adverse selection costs.
  </p>

    Measures of Trading Cost
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   To estimate trading costs, empirical methodologies rely on the simple intuition that transactions would occur at the true underlying security value in the absence of trading costs. Hence, the deviation between transaction price and an estimate of the true underlying security value is an estimate of trading cost. For buyer (seller) initiated trades, the traded price is expected to be higher (lower) than the true security value, the difference being the estimate of trading cost.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Quoted Spread
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The simplest measure of trading cost is the quoted spread (QS), which is defined as the difference between the bid and ask prices. The quoted spread measures the cost of completing a round trip (buy and sell), if trades are executed at the quoted prices. Execution costs for a single trade are often measured as half the spread, described on a percentage basis by

   , is a proxy for the true underlying security value.
  </p>
  <h4>
   The Effective Spread
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In many dealer markets, including those that trade fixed-income securities and foreign exchange, the quoted prices are simply a starting point for negotiations between customers and dealers, and transactions frequently occur at prices other than the quotes. Also, in some markets, including those relying on trading floors, there may be
   <i>
    latent liquidity
   </i>
   not reflected in the quotes. On the NYSE, for example, market orders may execute at prices within the quotes when the specialist (the NYSE's designated dealer) or a floor broker elects to improve on the quote
   <math display="inline">
    [28, 30]
   </math>
   (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Specialist Markets
   </b>
   ). Many electronic exchanges allow traders to hide some or all of the order size, implying that limit orders offering more attractive prices than the quotes may exist on the book
   <math display="inline">
    [4]
   </math>
   (see Order Types). Further, quoted prices pertain only to the quoted depth; large orders might exhaust the depth at the quote and "walk up the book", executing against limit orders with less attractive prices and leading to a weighted-average trade price outside the quotes.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   When trades occur either within or outside the quotes, a better measure of trading costs is the percentage effective half spread, which is based on the actual trade price, and is computed on a percentage basis as described in equation (2):
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Effective half spread =

   . The effective spread is based on the deviation between the execution price and the true underlying value of the security, and can be viewed as an estimate of the execution cost actually paid by the trader and the gross revenue earned by the liquidity provider.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   It is also possible to distinguish between the noninformational (inventory and order processing) and informational (adverse selection) components of trading costs, on the basis of the behavior of prices subsequent to a transaction. The seminal paper using this approach is [21]. The intuition is that noninformational transaction costs should result only in a
   <i>
    temporary
   </i>
   deviation of price from value, evidenced by a price reversal after the trade. In other words, while customer purchases (sales) should occur at prices above (below) pretrade value, we should subsequently observe a partial reversal of the price change. The price reversal is partial rather than full because the informational component of trading costs is, on average, associated with a
   <i>
    permanent
   </i>
   increase (decrease) in security value after buys (sells). The informational component can be measured by the change in the estimate of security value, while the noninformational component can be measured by the reversal from trade price to posttrade value.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Estimating the Informational Component: The Price Impact of Trades
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The possible presence of informed traders is revealed to liquidity providers in a noisy manner by the order flow imbalance, that is, the difference between quantities of buy versus sell orders, which will tend to be positive when the security is undervalued and negative when the security is overvalued. Market makers incorporate the information in order flow imbalances by adjusting quotes upward (downward) after buy (sell) orders. These price adjustments reflect both the proportion of the informed traders versus liquidity traders in the market, and the extent of superior information about security value held by the informed traders. The private information contained in trades, or equivalently the amount of adverse selection cost incurred by the liquidity provider, can

   ). Research has documented that markets are particularly sensitive to order flow imbalances ahead of anticipated news disclosures, such as earnings announcements by corporations [23], as price impacts are larger than on nonannouncement days. The price impact of trades is an often used empirical proxy in the corporate finance literature for the degree of information asymmetry regarding security value across traders.

    Estimating the Noninformational Component: Realized Spreads
   </i>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The presence of informed traders will cause market prices, on average, to rise after customer buys and to fall after customer sells. Owing to these adverse price movements, market makers earn less than the effective spreads for their services. Market making revenue net of losses to better-informed traders can be measured by the
   <i>
    reversal

   from the trade price to the posttrade value. The realized spread captures the extent of reversal, computed using equation (4):

  <p block-type="Text">
   As noted above, some studies refer to price impact and realized spreads as the "permanent" and "temporary" price impacts of a trade [21, 25]. Some authors [29] have argued that trading costs and market quality are better measured by temporary price impacts (realized spreads) than by total price impacts (effective spreads).
  </p>
  <h1>
   <b>
    Implementation Issues
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   To measure effective or realized spreads, researchers need to identify (i) whether the trade was initiated
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   by a buyer or a seller, and (ii) estimates of security value before and after the trade. As documented in recent research, the methodological choices regarding these issues are nontrivial and can significantly affect estimates of trade execution costs [27, 32].

   <i>
    Algorithms for Assigning Trade Direction
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Some publicly available databases from international markets, for example, Euronext-Paris and the Toronto Stock Exchange, as well as some proprietary datasets on institutional trading, for example, those provided by consulting firms Abel/Noser or Plexus, contain information on the buy and sell orders submitted to the markets. In contrast, databases such as Trade and Quote (TAQ) (released by the NYSE) and Nastraq (released by Nasdaq), which are widely studied owing to their comprehensive inclusion of all trade and quote data for all listed US stocks, do not provide information on underlying buy and sell orders. As a consequence, the direction of the trade (i.e., whether the trade was initiated by a buyer or a seller) must be imperfectly inferred from the available data (see [2] for a detailed discussion).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In datasets where order level data is not available, the most widely used algorithm for assigning trade direction is that recommended by Lee and Ready [24]. Their algorithm assigns trades completed at prices above (below) the prevailing quote midpoint as buyer (seller) initiated trades. Trades executed at the quote midpoint are classified on the basis of a "tick test". The tick test assigns a trade as a buy (sell) if the trade executes at a higher (lower) price as compared to the most recent trade at a different price. An alternative algorithm is proposed by Ellis, Michaely and O'Hara [11], who assign trades executed at the ask (bid) quote as buyer (seller) initiated, while using the tick test for all other trades. On the basis of proprietary order level data, prior research finds that the algorithm proposed by Lee and Ready [24] works fairly well, classifying about 85% of the trades correctly.a Error rates are slightly lower for the algorithm proposed by Ellis, Michaely and O'Hara [11] (see [2] and [12]).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Research based on data from the early 1990s [14] finds that trade report times lagged actual trade times for NYSE stocks. As a consequence, studies such as [24] recommend adjusting the time stamps by 5 s when comparing trades and quotes. However, for recent data, Bessembinder [2] and Ellis, Michaely and
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   O'Hara [11] report that the allowance for reporting lags is not necessary. They recommend that trades are best compared to contemporaneous quotations for both NYSE and Nasdaq stocks when assigning trades as buyer or seller initiated.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Pretrade Benchmark Price
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Pretrade price impact refers to implicit trading costs that may be incurred if prices move systematically away from the trader (rising before buys or dropping before sells) between the time of a trade decision and complete execution of the order [26]. Pretrade price impact will tend to arise when larger orders are broken into smaller orders and executed successively. Prices may also move away from a trader because his trading intentions are detected by market participants who then "front run" the order or engage in "predatory trading" [7], or simply infer information from the existence of the trading interest. In addition, prices will tend to move away from traders relying on momentum strategies. Executing a trading program too slowly exposes traders to the risk of larger pretrade price impacts. On the other hand, executing orders that are larger than quote sizes too quickly may result in larger effective spreads. The skill of a trader handling larger orders lies in balancing these effects. To capture the impact of trader's "timing" and "liquidity" decisions, Perold [26] recommends that the average of the prevailing bid and ask quote at the time of the trading decision be used as the pretrade benchmark price.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   However, data on trade decision times is often not available, except in specialized proprietary datasets such as that studied by Conrad, Johnson and Wahal [8]. Studies using publicly available datasets, including [17] and [3] use the quote midpoint at the time of the trade as the pretrade benchmark price. Although adverse drift in prices ahead of trade executions is most obviously an issue for larger traders, recent evidence [2, 27, 32] indicates that prices move systematically and adversely in the seconds before even small trades are executed. Bessembinder [2] recommends that researchers use quotation midpoints in effect 5 s prior to the trade report time as a proxy for the true underlying price (
   <i>
    Vit
   </i>
   ) when measuring effective spreads and price impact of trades.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Posttrade Benchmark Price
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The posttrade benchmark price (
   <i>
    Vit
   </i>
   <sup>
    +
   </sup>
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   ) should be measured when the market has had sufficient time to incorporate the information contained in the trade [17]. If the period after the trade time is too short, temporary price effects may still dominate, or alternately, the market may not have had a chance to assess the trade's likely information content. If the period is too long, the measure will become unnecessarily noisy because of the arrival of extraneous information. In the absence of theoretical guidance, studies have used different proxies for the posttrade benchmark price. Studies using institutional data have often used the closing price on the day of trade as the posttrade price [20]. The practitioner literature commonly relies on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) on the day of the trade. Among datasets with broad coverage, Huang and Stoll [17] use the first trade price both 5 and 30 min after the trade, while Bessembinder and Kaufman [3] use the quote midpoint 30 min and 24 h after the trade. Bessembinder [2] used the midquote in effect 30 min after the time of the reference quote, or the 4 p.m.-quotation for trades completed during the last half hour of trading. Werner [32] reports that realized spread measures obtained in large samples are relatively insensitive to the choice of the posttrade benchmark price.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Since September 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has required each US stock "market center" to compile and disseminate on a monthly basis various standardized measures of execution quality in nearly all publicly traded securities [6]. The intent of SEC Rule 605 (formerly 11Ac1-5) is to provide traders with information on execution quality at different market centers. The execution quality measures that each market now reports include round-trip effective spreads, realized spreads, as well as average execution speed. The regulation provides something of an official validation of the effective spread and realized spread measures described above, and also codifies a specific methodology to estimate trading costs based on the order level data available to each market center. Specifically, the effective spread compares the traded price to the quote midpoint (as a proxy for
   <i>
    Vit
   </i>
   ) at order arrival, while the realized spread is based on the quote midpoint (as a proxy for

    Evidence on Trading Costs
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Jones [19] provides a detailed perspective on trading cost in US markets over the last century. He estimates that quoted spreads on Dow Jones stocks were in the range of 0.60% for sustained periods until the beginning of 1980s, with spikes in spreads observed during market downturns, such as the Great Depression. He documents that during the last two decades trading costs have fallen dramatically to around 0.20% for Dow stocks, partly facilitated by regulation but mainly by increased competition among market centers with the onset of electronic trading systems (see [15] for recent evidence).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Several recent studies have examined execution quality for comparable firms on the two major US market centers—the NYSE and the Nasdaq. In 2001, subsequent to regulatory changes, Bessembinder [1] reports that effective spreads are similar for comparable firms in the two markets. The most recent evidence available appears to be that reported Boehmer [6], using Rule 605 data over November 2001 to December 2003; he reports an average effective spread for NYSE stocks of 6.2 cents per share,
   <i>
    versus
   </i>
   8.8 cents for comparable Nasdaq stocks.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Several studies have examined execution quality in market outside the United States. For example, Venkataraman [31] reports that effective spread for large firms traded on the Paris Bourse were 0.25% in 1997, relative to 0.21% for comparable firms on NYSE. Jain [18] reports on trading costs during the year 2000 for liquid firms on 51 stock exchanges around the world. The average effective (realized) spread across exchanges is 2.13% (2.15%). However, there is considerable variation in effective (realized) spreads across markets, ranging from 0.10% (0.25%) at the NYSE (Luxembourg) to 14.47% (14.6%) in Ukraine. Research indicates that differences in execution quality across markets are related to both exchange-design features, such as tick size and order handling rules, and the regulatory environment, such as the enforcement of insider trading laws and the protection of shareholder rights [5, 10].

    Conclusions
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Trade execution costs, which reflect the price concessions necessary to complete transactions quickly, are
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   important indicators of market quality and important determinants of traders' actual investment results. Execution costs arise because it is costly to provide liquidity, including order processing costs, inventory holding costs, and losses suffered to better-informed traders. Trading costs can be estimated on the basis of comparisons of trade prices with proxies for underlying security value, the most common proxy being quote midpoints. Comparisons can be of trade prices to midpoints at or before the time of the trade, as in effective spread measures, or to midpoints after the trade, as in realized spread measures. Further, the amount of asymmetric information present in a market can be estimated by assessing trades' price impact, measured as the difference between post- and pretrade estimates of security value. Recent research indicates that trade execution costs have declined steadily in US markets in recent years, particularly subsequent to decimalization in 2001, and documents substantial variation in average trading costs across international equity markets.
