    Risk-neutral Pricing

  <p block-type="Text">
   A classical problem arising frequently in business is the valuation of future cash flows that are risky. By the term
   <i>
    risky
   </i>
   we mean that the payment is not of a deterministic nature; rather there is some uncertainty in the amount of the future cash flows. Of course, in real life, virtually everything happening in the future contains some element of uncertainty.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As an example, let us think of an investment project, say, a company plans to build a new factory. A classical way to proceed is to calculate a
   <i>
    net asset value
   </i>
   . One tries to estimate the future cash flows generated by the project in the subsequent periods. In the present example, they will initially be negative; this initial investment should be compensated by the positive cash flows in the later periods. Having fixed these estimates of the future cash flows for all periods, one calculates a
   <i>
    net asset value
   </i>
   by discounting these cash flows to the present date. But, of course, there is uncertainty involved in the estimation of the future cash flows and people doing these calculations are, of course, aware of that. The usual way to compensate for this uncertainty is to apply an interest rate that is higher than the
   <i>
    riskless
   </i>
   <sup>
    a
   </sup>
   <i>
    rate of return
   </i>
   corresponding to the rate of return of government bonds.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The spread between the riskless rate of return and the interest rate used for discounting the future cash flows in the calculation of the net asset value can be quite substantial in order to compensate for the riskiness. Only if the net asset value, obtained by discounting with a rather high rate of return, remains positive, the management of the company will engage in the investment project.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Mathematically speaking, the above procedure may be described as follows: first, one determines the
   <i>
    expected values
   </i>
   of the future cash flows and, subsequently, one discounts by using an elevated discount factor. However, there is no systematic way of mathematically approaching the question of how the degree of uncertainty in the determination of the expected values can be quantified, and in which way this should be taken into account to determine the spread between the interest rates.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   We now turn to a different approach, which interchanges the roles of taking expectations and discounting in taking the riskness of the cash flows into
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   account. This approach is used in modern mathematical finance, in particular, in the Black–Scholes formula. However, the idea goes back much further and the method was used by actuaries for centuries.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Think of a life insurance contract. To focus on the essential point, we consider the simplest case: a one-year death insurance. If the insured person dies within the subsequent year, the insured sum
   <i>
    S
   </i>
   , say
   <i>
    S
   </i>
   = ¤1, is paid out at the end of this year; if the insured person survives the year, nothing is paid, and the contract ends at the end of the year.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   To calculate the premium
   <sup>
    b
   </sup>
   for this contract, actuaries look up in their mortality tablesc the probability that the insured person dies within one year. The traditional notation for this probability is
   <i>
    qx
   </i>
   , where
   <i>
    x
   </i>
   denotes the age of the insured person.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   To calculate the premium for such a one-year death insurance contract, with
   <i>
    S
   </i>
   normalized to
   <i>
    S
   </i>
   = 1, actuaries apply the formula
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    P = \frac{1}{1+i} q_x \tag{1}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The term
   <i>
    qx
   </i>
   is just the expected value of the future cash flow and
   <i>
    i
   </i>
   denotes "the" interest rate: hence the premium
   <i>
    P
   </i>
   is the
   <i>
    discounted expected value
   </i>
   of the cash flow at the end of the year.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   It is important to note that actuaries use a "conservative" value for the interest rate, for example,
   <i>
    i
   </i>
   = 3%. In practical terms, this corresponds quite well to the "riskless rate of return". In any case, it is quite different, in practical as well as in theoretical terms, from the discount factors used to calculate the net asset value of a risky future cash flow according to the method stated above.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   But, after all, the premium of our death insurance contract also corresponds to the present value of an uncertain future cash flow! How do actuaries account for the risk involved in this cash flow, if not
   <i>
    via
   </i>
   an appropriate choice of the interest rate?
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The answer is simple when looking at equation (1): apart from the interest rate
   <i>
    i
   </i>
   the probability
   <i>
    qx
   </i>
   of dying within the next year also enters the calculation of
   <i>
    P
   </i>
   . The art of the actuarial profession is to choose the "good" value for
   <i>
    qx
   </i>
   . Typically, actuaries very well know the actual mortality probabilities in their portfolio of contracts, which often consists of several hundred thousand contracts; in other words, they have a very good understanding of what the "true value" of
   <i>
    qx
   </i>
   is. However, they do not apply this "true value" in their premium calculations: in equation (1) they
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   would apply a value for
   <math display="inline">
    q_x
   </math>
   which is substantially higher than the "true" value of
   <math display="inline">
    q_x
   </math>
   . Actuaries speak about mortality tables of the first kind and the second kind.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Mortality tables of the second kind reflect the "true probabilities". They are only used for the internal analysis of the profitability of the insurance company. On the other hand, in the daily life of actuaries only the mortality tables of the first kind, which properly display the "modified" probabilities
   <math display="inline">
    q_x
   </math>
   , are used. They are not only used for the calculation of premia but also for all quantities of relevance involved in an insurance policy, such as surrender values, reserves, and so on. This constitutes a big strength of the actuarial technique: actuaries are always armed with perfectly coherent logic when doing all these calculations. This logic is that of a fair game or, mathematically speaking, of a martingale. Indeed, if the
   <math display="inline">
    q_x
   </math>
   would correctly model the mortality of the insured person and if i were the interest rate that the insurance company could precisely achieve when investing the premia, then the premium calculation
   <math display="inline">
    (1)
   </math>
   would make the insurance contract a fair game.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   It is important to note that this argument pertains only to a kind of virtual world, as it is precisely the task of actuaries to choose the mortalities
   <math display="inline">
    q_x
   </math>
   in a prudent way such that they do not coincide with the "true" probabilities. In the case of insurance contracts where the insurance company has to pay in the case of death, actuaries choose the probabilities
   <math display="inline">
    q_x
   </math>
   higher than the "true ones". This happens in the simple example considered above. On the other hand, if the insurance company has to pay when the insured person is still alive, for example, in the case of a pension, actuaries use probabilities
   <math display="inline">
    q_x
   </math>
   which are lower than the "true ones", in order to be on the safe side.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   These actuarial techniques have been elaborated on as this will be helpful to more clearly understand the essence of the option pricing approach of Black, Scholes, and Merton. Their well-known model for the risky stock

   The task is to value a (European) derivative on the stock S at expiration time T, for example,
   <math display="inline">
    C_T =

   <math display="inline">
    (S_T - K)_+

   The above equation is a perfect analog to the premium of a death insurance contract (1). The first term, taking care of the discounting, uses the "conservative" choice of a riskless interest rate
   <math display="inline">
    r

   Similarly as in the actuarial context above, the mathematical model of a financial market under the risk-neutral measure

   <math display="inline">
    O

   represents a "prudent choice of probability". It gives less weight than the original measure

   The history of the valuation formula (3), in fact, goes back much further than Black, Scholes, and Merton. Already in 1900, L. Bachelier applied this formula in his thesis [1] in order to price options. It seems worthwhile to have a closer look. Bachelier did not use a discount factor, such as
   <math display="inline">
    e^{-rT}
   </math>
   , in equation
   <math display="inline">
    (3)
   </math>
   . The reason is that in 1900 prices underlying the option were denoted in forward prices at the Paris stock exchange (called "true prices" by Bachelier who also carefully adjusted for coupon payments; see [6] for details). As it is well known, when considering forward prices the discount factor disappears. In modern terminology, this fact boils down to "Black's formula".
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As regards the second term in equation
   <math display="inline">
    (3)
   </math>
   , Bachelier started from the very beginning with a martingale model, namely, (scaled) Brownian motion [6]
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    S_t = S_0 + \sigma W_t, \qquad 0 \le t \le T \tag{8}

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In other words, he also "worked assuming the riskneutral probability".
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In fact, in the first pages of his thesis Bachelier does speak about two kinds of probabilities. The following is a quote from
   <math display="inline">
    [1]
   </math>
   :
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   (i) The probability which might be called "mathematical", which can be determined a priori and which is studied in games of chance.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   (ii) The probability dependent on future events and, consequently impossible to predict in a mathematical manner.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   This latter is the probability that the speculator tries to predict.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Admitting a large portion of goodwill and hindsight knowledge one might interpret (i) something like the risk-neutral probability
   <math display="inline">
