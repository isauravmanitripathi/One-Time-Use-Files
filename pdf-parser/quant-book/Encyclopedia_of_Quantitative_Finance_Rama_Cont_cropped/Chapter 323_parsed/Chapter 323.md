# **Oil Market**

The development of the internal combustion engine one century ago was the principal cause of the development of the oil market. In the 1950s, oil became more important than coal. Since then its importance has kept increasing, though it has been recently largely displaced by natural gas for heating and electricity generation. The rapid economic growth of China and of India has increased the world demand for oil. Currently, demand exceeds 90 billion barrels a day, stretching the global production capacity.

Bringing new oil fields to production requires typically several years and very large investments. The economic hurdles are compounded by environmental worries and by the unstable market structure of oil. Market instability is due to the low short-term elasticity of oil consumption to price changes. The large price fluctuations implied by the low elasticity of oil prices being related to trends in world economy carry a substantial risk premium that increases the cost of capital for oil projects. Over longer time periods, high prices discourage demand and increase production. Lower prices have the opposite effects. This leads to substantial mean reversion in oil prices over longer intervals. Over the long run, real oil prices have been mostly declining in real terms, with the exception of 1973–1981 and the current uptrend since 1998 (see Figure 1). Demand has been steadily increasing and it is projected that it will continue to grow (Figure 2). The concentration of oil reserves in the Middle East (Figure 3) suggests that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will cover a greater share of world production in the future (Figure 4). The very low marginal cost of production of most of OPEC oil acts as an additional deterrent to the investment necessary for the development of alternative resources.

# **Crude Oil**

The price of crude oil varies with the ease of refining it. Lower density oil with lower sulfur content is more easily processed. The market for crude oil is based on the two benchmarks of Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil. Changes in these benchmarks show little day-to-day correlation with changes in prices of Middle Eastern oil. It is likely that, owing to the increasing oil flow to Asia, a new benchmark will soon emerge.

The spot market for oil is dwarfed by the futures market that currently has volumes about 15 times larger than the market for physical oil. Oil swaps bridge gaps between short-term maturities and allow also for trading over very long maturities. Historically, the WTI price was slightly higher than the Brent price, reflecting the fact that the difference in oil price across the Atlantic was centered around the marginal cost of shipping oil westward. The emergence of China as the largest oil importer has led recently to frequent spread reversals. Local imbalances are now more random because of the growing importance of the eastward flow of Middle Eastern oil.

# **Futures**

Futures contracts require the delivery of oil at a later date. They are standardized for quantity and quality, they are traded in exchanges, and their delivery price is adjusted daily to reflect changes in value and limit credit risk (mark to market). Margin requirements ensure the funds necessary for marking to market [1].

Traders are commonly classified as hedgers, market makers, or speculators. Hedgers want to offset price risk. They regard these contracts as insurance contracts. They are willing to pay a premium to reduce their risk. Market makers provide liquidity and hope to gain from temporary imbalances of supply and demand. Speculators take a position based on their view of price trends, with no specific interest to trade physical oil.

Most futures trade for maturities up to five years, though contracts up to eight years exist. Over-thecounter trading is active up to 10 years. Mean reversion reduces the correlation of price changes at maturities far apart and limits the relevance of current shocks for far delivery. Because of low correlation, diversification across maturities may achieve significant risk reduction. Diversifying across qualities, or even across most commodities, leads to much smaller risk reduction because the price of most commodities is highly correlated with the price of oil for the same maturity.

Most futures contracts are settled by entering the opposite trade. This allows hedgers more flexibility on delivery time, place, and quality. The difference

between the spot and the futures price is called *basis*. Because hedgers, after closing their future position, need to trade in the physical market, their final result will depend not only on the change in value of their futures, but also on the change of basis. That is known as *basis risk*.

# **Crude Oil Curve**

The crude oil curve shows the price of oil for delivery at different dates. Its shape changes through time, from upward (contango) to downward (backwardation) sloping, occasionally with a hump. The shape of

the crude oil curve is influenced by the risk-free rate, the storage cost of oil, and inventory levels. When inventories are plentiful, investors are willing to hold them because the oil curve is typically upward sloping. The cost of financing and storing oil determines then the futures price in relation to the spot price. When the crude oil curve is downward sloping, the willingness of investors to hold oil is limited. Only investors who worry about the possibility that disruptions in supply may interfere with timely delivery are then willing to hold a physical inventory. The implicit cost of holding expensive oil that may only be delivered with certainty at a loss through the sale of futures contract is known as *convenience yield*. It represents the marginal benefit that investors assign to the flexible availability of oil relative to term delivery. It follows that convenience yield is negatively related to the slope of the crude oil curve. This traditional relationship has been challenged by the influx of financial institutions into the crude oil market since 2004. Moreover, oil tankers ensure that supply is very predictable for the next ninety days, while greater uncertainty dominates longer maturities.

# **Crack Spread**

All the crude oil has to be processed in refineries. Refiners buy crude and sell refined products: gasoline, diesel, heating oil. The difference between the price of a barrel of oil and the price of its refined components is known as *crack spread*. It represents the refiners' revenue for processing oil. It depends on the spare refining capacity available and the conditions prevailing in the markets for crude and refined products [2].
