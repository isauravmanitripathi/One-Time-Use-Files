   Contracts
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In quantitative modeling of the electricity market, a fundamental question is to establish the link between spot and forward prices. The classical theory of arbitrage, including storage and convenience yield, does not easily carry over to electricity because of a single complicating fact: the nonstorability of the commodity. In this article, we discuss the spotforward relation for electricity in view of the classical theory.

  <h2>
   Forward Pricing by No Arbitrage
  </h2>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Let us recall how to derive forward prices using noarbitrage arguments. Denote by
   <math display="inline">
    S(t)
   </math>
   the spot price of an asset at time
   <math display="inline">
    t &gt; 0
   </math>
   , and consider a forward contract with delivery at time
   <math display="inline">
    T \ge t
   </math>
   . To prevent arbitrage opportunities, the forward price
   <math display="inline">
    f(t, T)
   </math>
   at time t must be
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    f(t,T) = S(t) \exp(r(T-t)) \tag{1}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   with
   <math display="inline">
    r &gt; 0
   </math>
   being the risk-free interest rate. If this is not the case, we can exploit a buy-and-hold strategy to obtain arbitrage. For example, if
   <math display="inline">
    f(t, T) &gt;
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    S(t) \exp(r(T-t))
   </math>
   , finance a purchase of the spot contract with borrowing money and go short the forward. At delivery, hand over the spot, pay the debt with continuously compounding interest
   <math display="inline">
    r
   </math>
   , and receive the forward price. This entails in a sure win
   <math display="inline">
    f(t, T) - S(t) \exp(r(T - t))
   </math>
   . Obviously, if the forward price is less than
   <math display="inline">
    S(t) \exp(r(T-t))
   </math>
   , the strategy above is reversed. A fundamental assumption in this trading scheme is the storability of the spot.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   If
   <math display="inline">
    S(t)
   </math>
   is a semimartingale process on a filtered probability space
   <math display="inline">
    (\Omega, (\mathcal{F}_t), \mathcal{F}, P)

   , that is,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    f(t,T) = \mathbb{E}_{Q} \left[ S(T) \, | \, \mathcal{F}_{t} \right] \tag{2}

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    \mathcal{F}_t

   is the given information filtration in the market. We remark in passing that, in general, we have many pricing measures

    Q
   </math>
   for a semimartingale
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   process, but because of the buy-and-hold strategy we get a unique forward price.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The risk premium is defined as the difference between the forward price and the predicted spot price at delivery, that is,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">

  <p block-type="Text">
   which is negative in "normal" markets since the expected return
   <math display="inline">
    \mu
   </math>
   is naturally bigger than the riskfree interest rate, Hence, the forward price is below the expected spot, which is referred to as the forward market being in normal backwardation. In economical terms, this is explained as the producers wanting to secure their future income and hence creating a hedging pressure in the market. The opposite situation, when the risk premium is positive, is referred to as the forward market being
   <i>
    contango
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   One can easily imagine frictions in the market preventing the feasability of the buy-and-hold strategy. Typically, in commodity markets, costs related to storage and transportation are incurred. The price for storage leads to a modification of the forward price. One also talks of a convenience vield in commodity markets, understanding a discount in the forward price due to the
   <i>
    convenience
   </i>
   to own the underlying spot. In effect, these modifications lead to a forward price
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    f(t,T) = S(t) \exp((r-\delta)(T-t)) \tag{6}

   <math display="inline">
    \delta
   </math>
   is a factor accounting for storage, convenience yield, transportation, and so on.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The forward price can still be expressed in terms of a conditional expectation as in equation (2), but now we use pricing measures
   <math display="inline">
    Q
   </math>
   , which do not necessarily turn the discounted spot dynamics into a
   <math display="inline">
    Q
   </math>
   -martingale. Hence, by a specific choice of
   <math display="inline">
    Q
   </math>
   one may represent equation
   <math display="inline">
    (6)
   </math>
   as in equation
   <math display="inline">
    (2)
   </math>
   . Considering the specific case of a geometric Brownian motion again, equation (6) is obtained by using the Girsanov transformation to introduce a measure

   under which

   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   is a Brownian motion. Note that this change of measure does not turn the discounted spot price into a Q-martingale. However, more importantly, normal backwardation is no longer the immediate implication, since the sign of the risk premium
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    P(t,T) = S(t) \left( e^{(r-\delta)(T-t)} - e^{\mu(T-t)} \right) \tag{8}

   <math display="inline">

   , and
   <math display="inline">
    \mu

   which is not
   <i>
    a priori

   clear. Thus, we may have a market either in contango or in backwardation; however, we cannot have both in the sense that the sign of the risk premium changes with time to maturity of the contracts.

  <h4>
   The Case of Electricity
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In real electricity markets, the forward and futures contracts&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; deliver the power over a period rather than at a specific future time point. Thus, a long position entered at time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   in an electricity forward delivering over the period
   <math display="inline">
    [\tau_1, \tau_2], t \leq \tau_1

  <p block-type="Text">

    F(t, \tau_1, \tau_2)

   <math display="inline">
    F(t, \tau_1, \tau_2)
   </math>
   should be.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Electricity is a nonstorable commodity by physical nature. Once purchased, we must use it, and any buyand-hold strategy is not feasible. One cannot talk of any storage costs for electricity and nor of any convenience yield. This means that there is no natural connection as in equation (6). However, based on equation (2) we can
   <i>
    define
   </i>
   the electricity forward price as
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    F(t, \tau_1, \tau_2) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{Q}} \left[ \frac{1}{\tau_2 - \tau_1} \int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} S(T) \, \mathrm{d}T \, | \, \mathcal{F}_t \right] \tag{10}

  <p block-type="Text">
   Interchanging expectation and

   measure Q. Since
   <math display="inline">
    S(t)
   </math>
   is nonstorable, it cannot be used for any hedging purposes, and in this respect functions only like an index for the forward price. We can therefore choose any stochastic dynamics we like for the spot, even going beyond the semimartingale framework as is usually required in mathematical finance. The pricing measure
   <math display="inline">
    O
   </math>
   is a priori any equivalent probability measure. In practice, however, we want to choose a
   <math display="inline">
    O
   </math>
   such that we know the dynamics of
   <math display="inline">
    S
   </math>
   under this measure to be able to calculate the conditional expectation. A valid choice is
   <math display="inline">
    Q = P
   </math>
   ; however, this would imply a zero-risk premium, which is hardly a realistic situation.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Empirical investigations in electricity markets show that one may have a change of sign in the risk premium. Thus, it may not be the case that the market is either in normal backwardation or in contango. In fact, one has observed a positive premium in the short end of the forward market, whereas contracts with maturity in the longer end have a negative premium. The latter is consistent with producers creating a hedging pressure since they want to lock in their production. However, the positive premium in the short end has been explained by the consumers' wish to hedge the spike risk inherent in spot prices. Thus, in order to hedge the risk of paying a high spot price, the consumers are willing to pay a premium. See [7] for more on this. Bessembinder and Lemmon [5] develop an equilibrium model for the electricity market with consumers and producers. On the basis of a discrete-time equilibrium model for the spot prices, the authors show that the risk premium in the forward market depends on both price variation and right skewedness of prices. Longstaff and Wang [8] found empirical evidence for these propositions in the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland (PJM) market.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath" class="has-continuation">
   We observe that, by definition,
   <math display="inline">
    F(t, \tau_1, \tau_2)
   </math>
   is a
   <math display="inline">
    Q
   </math>
   -martingale. This is in accordance with the noarbitrage theory that states that all forward contracts must be martingales under the pricing measure. Observe that when t approaches start of delivery
   <math display="inline">
    \tau_1
   </math>
   , we do not, in general, have that
   <math display="inline">
    F(t, \tau_1, \tau_2)
   </math>
   converges to the spot price. This is rather natural since the forward contract depends on the spot over a period of delivery, and not only at a fixed time of delivery. On the other hand, this is a distinct feature for electricity markets, which is not observed in most other commodity markets. An immediate effect of this is that one does not expect the same degree

   The range of spot models that allow for explicit electricity forward prices is rather limited. Much of the literature on commodites focuses on meanreverting spot price models, and the exponential Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process (

   <i>
    f (t, T )
   </i>
   , it seems to be very hard to obtain the same for electricity forwards (see [4] for examples). On the other hand, arithmetic models as suggested in [2] seem to be appropriate for this.

   can be approached from several different angles. The most common is by means of introducing a parameterized class of pricing measures
   <i>

   , that is, pricing measures that depend on one or more parameters. These parameters will appear in the forward prices, and thus one may estimate them by calibration to observed forward prices. The relation between

   Benth

   [1] propose to model the formation of forward prices from spot by using the certainty equivalence principle. Two representative agents, a consumer and a producer, decide whether to trade in the spot or forward market, based on where prices are more preferable. The certainty equivalence principle leads to forward pricing bounds within which the settled forward prices must lie. Introducing the market power as an explanatory variable, forward prices can be expressed in terms of the spot. Moreover, the risk premium is stochastic, and a positive premium in the short end of the forward curve is explicitly linked to the spikes in the spot, a feature which is in line with [7]. One may derive the risk neutral pricing measure for option pricing purposes. Empirical

At Nord Pool, say, the market trades in contracts with overlapping delivery periods, leading to certain price relations that must be met to avoid arbitrage possibilities. Benth and Koekebakker [3] show that this leads to rather strong restrictions on the feasible models; for instance, geometric Brownian motion with timedependent volatility is ruled out. Furthermore, the connection to the underlying spot price is lost since there is no convergence of electricity forwards to the spot when time to delivery goes to zero. We refer to [3] and the monograph [4] for more discussion on these issues and empirical studies of data from Nord Pool where a market model (
