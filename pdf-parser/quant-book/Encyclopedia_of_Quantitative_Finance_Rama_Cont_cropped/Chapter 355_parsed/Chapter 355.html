    Pricing Kernels
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Pricing kernels or stochastic discount factors (SDFs) (see Stochastic Discount Factors) are used to represent valuation operators in dynamic stochastic economies. A kernel is a commonly used mathematical term for representing an operator. The term stochastic discount factor (SDF) extends concepts from economics and finance to include adjustments for risk. As we will see, there is a close connection between the two terms. The terms
   <i>
    pricing kernel
   </i>
   and SDF are often used interchangeably.

   After deriving convenient representations for prices, we provide several examples of stochastic discount factors and discuss econometric methods for estimating and testing asset pricing models that restrict stochastic discount factors.

   We follow Ross [49] and Harrison and Kreps [34] by exploring the implications of no arbitrage in frictionless markets to obtain convenient representations of pricing operators. We build these operators as mappings that assign prices that trade in competitive markets to payoffs on portfolios of assets. The payoffs specify how much a numeraire good is provided in alternative states of the world. To write these operators, we invoke the
   <i>
    law of one price
   </i>
   , which stipulates that any two assets with the same payoff must necessarily have the same price. This law is typically implied by but is weaker than the
   <i>
    principle
   </i>
   of no arbitrage (see Fundamental Theorem of Asset
   <b>
    Pricing
   </b>
   ). Formally, the principle of no arbitrage stipulates that nonnegative payoffs that are positive with positive (conditional) probability command a strictly positive price. To see why the principle implies the law of one price, suppose that there is such a nonnegative portfolio payoff and call this portfolio
   <math display="inline">
    a
   </math>
   . If two portfolios, say
   <math display="inline">
    b
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    c
   </math>
   have the same payoff but the price of portfolio
   <math display="inline">
    b
   </math>
   is less than that of portfolio
   <math display="inline">
    c
   </math>
   , then an arbitrage opportunity exists. This can be seen by taking a long position on portfolio
   <math display="inline">
    b
   </math>
   , a short position on portfolio
   <math display="inline">
    c
   </math>
   , and using the proceeds to purchase portfolio
   <math display="inline">
    a
   </math>
   . This newly constructed portfolio has zero price but a positive payoff, violating the principle of no arbitrage.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Given that we can assign prices to payoffs, let
   <math display="inline">

   How does one construct a representation of this type? There are alternative ways to achieve this. First, suppose that (i)

   also satisfies a conditional continuity restriction, and (iv) the principle of no arbitrage is satisfied. The existence of a kernel
   <math display="inline">
    s_{t+1}
   </math>
   follows from a conditional version of the Riesz representation theorem [30]. Second, suppose that (i)

   consists of all bounded random variables that are

   Pricing is reduced to riskless discounting and a distorted (risk-neutral) conditional expectation. The insight provided in [34, 49] is that dynamic asset pricing in the absence of arbitrage is captured by the existence of a positive (with probability one) martingale that can be used to represent prices in conjunction with a sequence of one-period riskless discount factors. Moreover, it justifies an arguably mild modification of the "efficient market hypothesis" that states that discounted prices should behave as martingales with the appropriate cash-flow adjustment. While Rubinstein [50] and Lucas [42] had clearly shown that efficiency should not preclude risk compensation, the notion of equivalent martingale measures reconciles the points of view under greater generality. The martingale property and associated "risk-neutral pricing" are recovered for some distortion of the historical probability measure that encapsulates risk compensation. This distortion preserves "equivalence" (the two probability measures agree about which events in
   <math display="inline">
    \mathcal{F}_t
   </math>
   are assigned probability zero measure for each finite
   <math display="inline">
    t

  <p block-type="Text">
   The concept of equivalent martingale measure (for each
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   ) has been tremendously influential in derivative asset pricing. The existence of such a measure allows risk-neutral pricing of all contingent claims that are attainable because their payoff can be perfectly duplicated by self-financing strategies. Basic results from probability theory are directly exploitable in characterizing asset pricing in an arbitrage-free environment. More details can be found in Econometrics of Option Pricing.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Although we have developed this discussion for a discrete-time environment, there are wellknown continuous-time extensions. In the case of continuous-time Brownian motion information structures, the change of measure has a particularly simple structure. In accordance to the Girsanov theorem, the Brownian motion under the original probability measure becomes a Brownian motion with drift under the risk-neutral measure. These drifts absorb the adjustments for exposure to Brownian motion risk.

    Investors' Preferences

   Economic models show how exposure to risk is priced and what determines riskless rates of interest. As featured by Ross [49], the risk exposure that
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">

Empirical macroeconomics seeks to identify macroeconomic shocks to quantify responses of macroeconomic aggregates to those shocks. Asset pricing models assign prices to exposure of cash flows to the identified shocks. The risk prices are encoded in SDF processes and hence are implicit in the risk-neutral probability measures used in financial engineering.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   SDFs implied by specific economic models often reflect investor preferences. Subjective rates of discount and intertemporal elasticities appear in formulas for risk-free interest rates, and investors' aversion to risk appears in formulas for the prices assigned to alternative risk exposures. Sometimes the reflection of investor preferences is direct and sometimes it is altered by the presence of market frictions. In what follows, we illustrate briefly some of the SDFs that have been derived in the literature.

   Power Utility

   , the recursive utility model coincides with a model in which investors have a concern about robustness as in [6].

  <p block-type="Text">
   The recursive utility model is just one of a variety of ways of altering investors' preferences. For instance, Constantinides [15] and Heaton [36] explore implications of introducing intertemporal complementarities in the form of "habit persistence".

  <h4>
   Consumption Externalities and Reference Utility
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Abel [1], Campbell and Cochrane [12] and Menzly et al. [45] develop asset pricing implications of models in which there are consumption externalities in models with stochastic consumption growth. These externalities can depend on a social stock of past consumptions. The implied one-period SDF in these models has the following form:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \frac{S_{t+1}}{S_t} = \exp(-\delta) \left(\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t}\right)^{-\rho} \frac{\phi(H_t)}{\phi(H_0)} \qquad (15)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The social stock of consumption is built as a possibly nonlinear function of current and past social consumption or innovations to social consumption. The construction of this stock differs across the various specifications. The process
   <math display="inline">
    \{H_t : t = 0, 1, \ldots\}
   </math>
   is the ratio of the consumption to the social stock and
   <math display="inline">
    \phi
   </math>
   is an appropriately specified function of this ratio. In a related approach, Garcia et al. [21] consider investors' preferences in consumption as being evaluated relative to a reference level that is determined externally. The SDF is
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \frac{S_{t+1}}{S_t} = \exp(-\delta) \left(\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t}\right)^{-\rho} \left(\frac{H_t}{H_0}\right)^{\eta} \tag{16}

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where the process
   <math display="inline">
    \{H_t : t = 0, 1, \ldots\}
   </math>
   is the ratio of the consumption to the reference level. In effect, the social externality in these models induces a preference shock or wedge to the SDF specification, which explicitly depends on the equilibrium aggregate consumption process. Finally, Bakshi and Chen [8] develop implications for a model in which relative wealth enters the utility function of investors.

   Private Information

   Suppose that individuals have private information about labor productivity that is conditionally independent, given aggregate information, leisure enters preferences in a manner that is additively separable and consumption allocations are Pareto optimal given the private information. As shown by Kocherlakota and Pistaferri [40], the SDF follows from the "inverse Euler equation" of

  <h4>
   Solvency Constraints
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Luttmer [43], He and Modest [35], and Cochrane and Hansen [14] study asset pricing implications in models with limits imposed on the state contingent debt that is allowed. Alvarez and Jermann [4] motivate such constraints by appealing to limited commitment as in [38, 39]. When investors default, they are punished by excluding participation in asset markets in the future. Chien and Lustig [13] explore the consequences of alternative (out of equilibrium) punishments. Following [43], the SDF in the presence of solvency constraints and power utility is
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \frac{S_{t+1}}{S_t} = \exp(-\delta) \left( \min_j \frac{C_{t+1}^j}{C_t^j} \right)^{-\rho} \tag{19}

   and in particular,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">

   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Thus, the consumer with the smallest realized growth rate in consumption has a zero Lagrange multiplier on his or her solvency constraint, and hence the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution for this person is equal to the SDF. For the other consumers, the binding constraint prevents them shifting consumption from the future to the current period.

   Long-term Risk

   The SDF process assigns prices to risk exposures at alternative investment horizons. To study pricing over these horizons, Alvarez and Jermann [5], Hansen and Scheinkman [32], and Hansen [24] use a Markov structure and apply factorizations of the following form:

   use this factorization to investigate the long-term links between the bond market and the macroeconomy, Hansen and Scheinkman [32] and Hansen [24] extend this factorization to study the valuation of cash flows that grow stochastically over time. As argued by Hansen and Scheinkman [32] and Hansen [24], these more general factorizations are valuable for the study of risk-return trade-offs for long investment horizons.

    Estimating Parametric Models
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In examples of SDFs like those given in the section Investors' Preferences, there are typically unknown parameters to estimate. This parametric structure often permits the identification of the SDF even with limited data on security market payoffs and prices. To explore this approach, we introduce a parameter
   <math display="inline">
    \theta
   </math>
   that governs say investors' preferences. It is worth noting that inference about
   <math display="inline">
    \theta
   </math>
   is a semiparametric statistical problem since we avoid the specification of the law of motion of asset payoffs and prices along with the determinants of SDFs. In what follows, we sketch the main statistical issues in the following simplified context.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Suppose that
   <math display="inline">
    s_{t+1} = \phi_{t+1}(\theta_o)
   </math>
   is a parameterized model of an SDF that satisfies
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    E\left[\phi_{t+1}(\theta_o)Y_{t+1}|\mathcal{G}_t\right] - Q_t = 0\tag{39}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    \phi_{t+1}
   </math>
   can depend on observed data but the parameter vector
   <math display="inline">
    \theta_o
   </math>
   is unknown. This conditional
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   moment restriction implies a corresponding unconditional moment condition:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    E\left[\phi_{t+1}(\theta_o)Y_{t+1} - Q_t\right] = 0\tag{40}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As emphasized by Hansen and Richard [30], conditioning information can be brought in through the back door by scaling payoffs and their corresponding prices by random variables that are
   <math display="inline">
    \mathcal{G}_t
   </math>
   measurable. Hansen and Singleton [33] describe how to use the unconditional moment condition to construct a GMM estimator of the parameter vector
   <math display="inline">
    \theta_{o}
   </math>
   with properties characterized by Hansen [23] (see also Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As an alternative, the parameterized family of models might be misspecified. Then the approach of [29] described previously could be used, whereby an estimator of
   <math display="inline">
    \theta_{o}
   </math>
   is obtained by minimizing
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \left[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=1}^{N}\phi_{t+1}(\theta)Y_{t+1} - Q_{t}\right] \left[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=1}^{N}Y_{t+1}Y_{t+1}'\right]^{-1} \times \left[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=1}^{N}\phi_{t+1}(\theta)Y_{t+1} - Q_{t}\right] \tag{41}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   with respect to
   <math display="inline">
    \theta
   </math>
   . This differs from a GMM formulation because the weighting matrix in the quadratic form does not depend on the SDF, but only on the second moment matrix of the payoff vector
   <math display="inline">
    Y_{t+1}
   </math>
   . This approach suffers from a loss of statistical efficiency in estimation when the model is correctly specified, but it facilitates comparisons across models because the choice of an SDF does not alter how the overall magnitude of the pricing errors is measured.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   As in [26, 29], the analysis can be modified to incorporate the restriction that pricing errors should also be small for payoffs on derivative claims. This can be formalized by computing the time series approximation to the least-squares distance between a candidate, but perhaps misspecified, SDF from the family of strictly positive random variables
   <math display="inline">
    z_{t+1}
   </math>
   that solve the pricing restriction:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    E(z_{t+1}Y_{t+1} - Q_t) = 0 \t\t(42)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   See [25] for more discussion of these alternative approaches for estimation.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   So far we have described econometric methods that reduce conditional moment restrictions
   <math display="inline">
    (33)
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    (40)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   to their unconditional counterparts. From a statistical perspective, it is more challenging to work with the original conditional moment restriction. Along this vein, Ai and Chen [2] and Antoine et al. [7] develop nonparametric methods to estimate conditional moment restrictions used to represent pricing restrictions. In particular, Antoine
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [7] develop a conditional counterpart to the continuously updated GMM estimator introduced by Hansen
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [27] in which the weighting matrix in GMM objective explicitly depends on the unknown parameter to be estimated.&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt; These same methods can be adapted to explicitly take account of conditioning information while allowing for misspecification as in [29].
