    Exercise Boundary Optimization Methods
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   One of the most important characteristics of the Monte Carlo simulation method is its intrinsically forward-looking nature. While this feature enables us to take into account inherently path-dependent payoff structures of any derivative contract with comparative ease, it makes it difficult to accommodate the inclusion of any early exercise rights into the contract. The two most commonly used methods to handle products with early exercise opportunities within a Monte Carlo simulation framework are regression-based techniques (which are covered in Bermudan Options) and exercise boundary opti

   <math display="inline">
    A

   and
   <math display="inline">
    B

   of contingent cash flows, both of which, individually, contain no exercise optionality. The product

    \Pi_0

   initially pays the same cash flows as product
   <math display="inline">

   or
   <i>
    higher
   </i>
   order options since they can be reformulated as a sequence of payable cash flows to continue until a final contingent payoff is attained, or to opt out at any of the intermediate exercise times.

   An intuitive approach to the choice of a reduced set of state variables is to monitor related financial contracts. Andersen [1] and Piterbarg [3] describe how swap rate levels and European swaptions values, even if only attainable in an approximate analytical fashion in any one given model, can be used to capture most of the callability value for Bermudan swaptions. They also show that for this family of financial contracts, a one-parameter choice for E

   for the assessment of the suitability of any particular functional form and choice of variables prior to its use in an exercise boundary optimization context. The useful observation is made that a functional form that works well for a given financial contract's exercise domain delineation with one model, even if the contract is simplified to a significant extent, practically always also works very well with other models for the fully fledged product version. This makes it possible, for instance, to visualize exercise domains computed with a nonrecombining tree implementation of a twofactor Libor market model for a short contract life such as 6-noncall-2, and to apply the same functional form with a fully factorized model for very longdated contracts.

   The typical shapes of its zero-level contour line (which is the exercise boundary) are shown in Figure 1. As an example for the use of this functional form, consider the callability of a payer's Bermudan swaption in a multifactor model, and consider

   The final result, by virtue of the inequality (10), is of course biased low since the valuation based on an optimized (implicit) functional approximation can only be as good as the exercise domain boundary is represented in the approximation. It can be shown readily, though, that for a small difference
   <i>
    ε
   </i>
   (defined in any suitable way) between the truly optimal exercise boundary and the one used in the numerical approximation, the difference between the numerically obtained value and the truly optimal value scales like the second order in

   whence small differences tend to have negligible influence on the calculation. Another mitigating factor with respect to the exercise boundary representation is that any mismatches only contribute proportionally to the probability of actually reaching this part of state space, that is, the exercise boundary only need be
