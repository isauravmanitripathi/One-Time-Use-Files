The matter is complex as it involves explaining how individuals make decisions when facing uncertain situations, the behavior of market instruments such as insurance, securities, and their prices, the welfare properties of the distribution of goods and services under uncertainty, and how risks are shared among the traders. It is not even obvious how to formulate market clearing under conditions of uncertainty. A popular view in the middle of the last century was that markets would only clear on the average and asymptotically in large economies.a This approach was a reflection of how insurance markets work, and followed a notion of actuarially fair trading.</p>",

Arrow taught at Stanford University and Harvard University. He is one of the founders of modern (post World War II) economic theory, and one of the most important economists of the twentieth century. For a full biographical note, the reader is referred to [18]. Born in 1921 in New York City to Harry and Lilian Arrow, Kenneth was raised in the city. He graduated from Townsend Harris High School and earned a bachelor's degree from the City College of New York studying under Alfred Tarski. After graduating in 1940, he went to Columbia University and after a hiatus caused by World War II, when he served with the Weather Division of the Army Air Forces, he returned to Columbia University to study under the great statistician Harold Hotelling at Columbia University. He received a master's degree in 1941 studying under A. Wald, who was the supervisor of his master's thesis on stochastic processes. From 1946 to 1949 he spent his time partly as a graduate student at Columbia and partly as a research associate at the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics at the University of Chicago; it was in in Chicago that he met his wife Selma Schweitzer. During that time, he also held the position of Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago. Initially interested in following a career as an actuary, in 1951 he earned his doctorate in economics from Columbia University working under the supervision of Harold Hotelling and Albert Hart. His published work on risk started in 1951 [3]. In developing his own approach to risk, Arrow grapples with the ideas of Shackle [39], Knight [35], and Keynes [34] among others, seeking and not always finding a rigorous mathematical foundation. His best-known works on financial markets date back to 1953 [3]. These works provide a solid foundation based on the</p>",

In this theory, one does not trade a good, but a \"contingent good\", namely, a good in each state of the world: apples when it rains and apples when it shines [10, 12, 30]. This way the theory of markets with <i>N</i> goods and <i>S</i> states of nature is formally identical to the theory of markets without uncertainty but with <i>N</i> × <i>S</i> commodities. Traders trade \"state contingent commodities\". This simple formulation allows one to apply the results of the theory of markets without uncertainty, to markets with uncertainty. One recovers most of the important results such as (i) the existence of a market equilibrium and (ii) the \"invisible hand theorem\" that establishes that market solutions are always Pareto efficient.

It requires that we all agree on all the possible states of the world that describe \"collective uncertainty\", and that we trade accordingly. This turns out to be more demanding than it seems: for example, one may need to have a separate market for apples when it rains than when it does not, and separate market prices for each case. The assumption requires <i>N</i> × <i>S</i> markets to guarantee market efficiency, a requirement that in some cases militates against the applicability of the theory. In a later article, Arrow simplified the demands of the theory and reduced the number of markets needed for efficiency by defining \"securities\", which are different payments of money exchanged among the traders in different states of</p>",

Arrow proves that by trading commodities and securities, one can achieve the same results as trading state contingent commodities [4, 5]. Rather than needing <i>N</i> × <i>S</i> markets, one needs a fewer number of markets, namely, <i>N</i> markets for commodities and <i>S</i> − 1 markets for securities. This approach was a great improvement and led to the study of securities in a rigorous and productive manner, an area in which his work has left a large legacy. The mathematical requirement to reach Pareto efficiency was simplified gradually to require that the securities traded should provide for each trader a set of choices with the same dimension as the original state contingent commodity approach. When this condition is not satisfied, the markets are called \"incomplete\". This led to a large literature on incomplete markets, for example, [26, 32], in which Pareto efficiency is not assured, and government intervention may be required, an area that exceeds the scope of this article.</p>",

In some cases, it could require an unrealistically large number of markets to reach efficient allocations. A clear example of this phenomenon arises for those risks that pertain to one individual at a time, called <i>individual risks</i>, which are not readily interpreted as states of the world on which we all agree and are willing to trade. Individuals' accidents, illnesses, deaths, and defaults, are frequent and important risks that fall under this category. Arrow [6] and Malinvaud [37] showed how individual uncertainty can be reformulated or reinterpreted as collective uncertainty. Malinvaud formalized the creation of states of collective risks from individual risks, by lists that describe all individuals in the economy, each in one state of individual risk. The theory of markets can be reinterpreted accordingly [14, 37, 38], yet remains somewhat awkward. The process of trading under individual risk using the Arrow–Debreu theory requires an unrealistically large number of markets. For example with <i>N</i> individuals, each in one of two individual states <i>G</i> (good) and <i>B</i> (bad), the number of (collective) states that are required to apply the Arrow–Debreu</p>",

For this reason, individual uncertainty is best treated with another formulation of uncertainty involving individual states of uncertainty and insurance rather than securities, in which market clearing is defined on the average and may never actually occur. In this new approach, instead of requiring <i>N</i> + <i>S</i> − 1 markets, one requires only <i>N</i> commodity markets and, with two states of individual risk, just one security: an insurance contract suffices to obtain asymptotic efficiency [37, 38]. This is a satisfactory theory of individual risk and insurance, but it leads only to asymptotic market clearing and Pareto efficiency. More recently, the theory was improved and it was shown that one can obtain exact market-clearing solutions and Pareto-efficient allocations based on <i>N</i> commodity markets with the introduction of a limited number of financial instruments called <i>mutual</i> <i>insurance</i> [14]. It is shown in [14] that if there are <i>N</i> households (consisting of <i>H</i> types), each facing the possibility of being in <i>S</i> individual states together with <i>T</i> collective states, then ensuring Pareto optimality requires only <i>H (S</i> − 1<i>)T</i> independent mutual insurance policies plus <i>T</i> pure Arrow securities.</p>",

In describing how we rank choices under uncertainty, one follows principles that were established to describe the way nature ranks what is most likely to occur, a topic that was widely explored and is at the foundation of statistics [31, 40]. To explain how individuals choose under conditions of uncertainty, Arrow used behavioral axioms that were introduced by Von Neumann and Morgenstern [41] for the theory of games<sup>c</sup> and axioms defined by De Groot [31] and Villegas [40] for the foundation of statistics.

The expected utility approach just described has been generally used since the midtwentieth century. Despite its elegance and appeal, from the very beginning, expected utility has been unable to explain a host of experimental evidence that was reported in the work of Allais [2] and others. There has been a persistent conflict between theory and observed behavior, but no axiomatic foundation to replace Von Neumann's foundational approach. The reason for this discrepancy has been identified more recently, and it is attributed to the fact that expected utility is dominated by frequent events and neglects rare events—even those that are potentially catastrophic, such as widespread default in today's economies. That expected utility neglects rare events was shown in [17, 19, 23]. In [23], the problem was traced back to Arrow's axiom of monotone continuity [7], which Arrow attributed to Villegas [40], and to the corresponding continuity axioms of Hernstein and Milnor, and De Groot [31], who defined a related continuity condition denoted \"<i>SP</i>4\". Because of this property, on which Arrow's work is based, the expected utility approach has been characterized as the \"dictatorship\" of frequent events, since it is dominated by the consideration of \"normal\" and frequent events [19].

This measure assigns most weight to rare events. The new formulation has both types of measures, so the new characterization of choice under uncertainty incorporates both (i) frequent and (ii) rare events in a balanced manner, conforming more closely to the experimental evidence on how humans choose under uncertainty [15]. The new specification gives welldeserved importance to catastrophic risks, and a special role to fear in decision making [23], leading to a more realistic theory of choice under uncertainty and foundations of statistics, [15, 23, 24]. The legacy of Kenneth Arrow's work is surprising but strong: the new theory of choice under uncertainty coincides with the old when there are no catastrophic risks so that, in reality, the latter is an extension of the former to incorporate rare events. Some of the most interesting applications are to environmental risks such as global warming [25]. Here Kenneth Arrow's work was prescient: Arrow was a contributor to the early literature on environmental risks and irreversibilities [11], along with option values.</p>",

This realization led to the new concept of \"markets with endogenous uncertainty\", created in 1991, and embodied in early articles [16, 27, 28] that established some of the basic principles and welfare theorems in markets with endogenous uncertainty. This, and other later articles ([20, 25, 27, 36]), established basic principles of existence and the properties of the general equilibrium of markets with endogenous uncertainty. It is possible to extend the Arrow–Debreu theory of markets to encompass markets with endogenous uncertainty and also to prove the existence of market equilibrium under these conditions [20]. But in the new formulation, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle rears its quizzical face. It is shown that it is no longer possible to fully hedge the risks that we create ourselves [16], no matter how many financial instruments we create. The equivalent of Russel's paradox in mathematical logic appears also in this context due to the self-referential aspects of endogenous uncertainty [16, 20]. Pareto efficiency of equilibrium can no longer be ensured. Some of the worst economic risks we face are endogenously determined— for example, those that led to the 2008–2009 global financial crisis [27]. In [27] it was shown that the creation of financial instruments to hedge individual risks—such as credit default insurance that is often a subject of discussion in today's financial turmoil—by themselves induce collective risks of widespread default. The widespread default that we experience today was anticipated in [27], in 1991, and in 2006, when it was attributed to endogenous uncertainty created by financial innovation as well as to our choices of regulation or deregulation of financial instruments. Examples are the extent of reserves that are required for investment banking operations, and the creation of mortgage-backed securities that are behind many of the default risks faced today [29]. Financial innovation of this nature, and the attendant regulation of new financial instruments, causes welfare gains for individuals—but at the same time creates new risks for society that bears the collective risks that ensue, as observed in 2008 and 2009. In this context, an extension of the Arrow–Debreu theory of markets can no longer treat markets with endogenous uncertainty as equivalent to markets with standard commodities. The symmetry of markets with and without uncertainty is now broken. We face a brave new world of financial innovation and the</p>",
