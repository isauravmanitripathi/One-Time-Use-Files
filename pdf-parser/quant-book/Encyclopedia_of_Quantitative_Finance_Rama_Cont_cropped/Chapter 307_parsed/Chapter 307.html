    Operational Risk
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A basic ingredient of the Basel II guidelines of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is the introduction of the new risk class of operational risk (OR). OR is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk, but excludes strategic and reputational risk. OR complements the more traditional risk classes of market risk (MR) and credit risk (CR), but it is more concerned with the overall quality assurance of banking operations, and as such borrows methodology more from such fields as reliability engineering and insurance mathematics. For the latter, see, for instance, McNeil et al. [17, Chapter 10] and Panjer [20]. The capital change for OR may range from 10 to 20%, say, of overall risk capital and for some banks top the charge for MR. Under the so-called Pillar I of Basel II, banks can choose among three increasingly quantitative approaches for the measurement of OR. The first two, namely, the basic indicator (BIA) and the standardized (SA) approach, yield volume-based measures for OR: risk capital is charged in proportion to gross income, either companywide in the case of the BIA or averaged across a number (typically 7) of business lines (BL) for the SA.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Larger international banks have to use the socalled advanced measurement approach (AMA), which, upon introduction in January 2008, is mainly referred to as the
   <i>
    loss distribution approach
   </i>
   (LDA). Under the Basel II setup, banks using the LDA have to prove to the local regulator that they have the necessary quantitative risk management environment. Further, insurance of OR losses up to 20% is allowed. Capital estimates are to be based on internal, external, as well as expert opinion data. Essentially, banks are free to choose their own analytic approach for the calculation of an LDA-based capital charge for OR. In the second section, we review some of the approaches used. The third section contains some comments on further work.

  <h3>
   The LDA Approach
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Basel II prescribes the use of Value-at-Risk as a risk measure for OR, with a confidence level of 99.9% and a measurement horizon of 1 year. Hence,

   by
   <math display="inline">
    L_T

   , the risk capital charge becomes

  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    RC_{OR}^{T} = VaR_{99.9\%}^{T} (L_{T}) = F_{L_{T}}^{\leftarrow}(0.999) \qquad (1)

  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    F_{L_{T}}^{\leftarrow}
   </math>
   denotes the generalized inverse of the distribution function (df) of the total loss random variable
   <math display="inline">
    L_T
   </math>
   . This function is also referred to as the
   <i>
    quantile function
   </i>
   . The variety of LDA models used by the industry now stems from the granularity of the stochastic frequency-severity models of
   <math display="inline">
    L_T
   </math>
   implemented, as well as from the extreme tail-fitting of
   <math display="inline">
    F_{L_T}
   </math>
   in order to estimate the 99.9% quantile.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   For internal data of banks, the basic structure of the OR data warehouse is as follows:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \mathcal{X} = \{X_k^{T-i,b,r} : i = 1, \dots, n, \quad b = 1, \dots, B,
   </math>
   <math display="block">
    r = 1, \dots, R, \quad k = 1, \dots, N^{T-i,b,r} \} \quad (2)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   i stands for the number of past observation years;
   <math display="inline">
    \mathcal{B}
   </math>
   stands for the different BL, typically
   <math display="inline">
    B = 8
   </math>
   ;
   <math display="inline">
    R
   </math>
   denotes the different risk types (RT); often
   <math display="inline">
    R = 7
   </math>
   :
   <math display="inline">
    N
   </math>
   (frequency) denotes the number of losses in year
   <math display="inline">
    T - i
   </math>
   , BL b, and RT r; and (severities) denotes the successive loss amounts
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   in these classes.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Finally, banks are allowed to cap the loss amounts recorded from below, for example, losses are only recorded above USD 20 000. As a consequence, the loss random variable (rv) to be modeled becomes
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    L_T = \sum_{b=1}^{B} \sum_{r=1}^{R} \sum_{k=1}^{N^{T,b,\ell}} X_{k,+}^{T,b,r} \tag{3}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   where the "
   <math display="inline">
    +
   </math>
   " denotes the above capping: a dauntful task indeed! It should be remarked at this point that the calculation of a capital charge for OR is methodologically very different from that for MR and CR. For MR, the confidence level is 99% and the modeling horizon is 10 days; this becomes 99.9% and 1 year for CR. Besides this, the underlying processes are totally different; for OR only losses are to be modeled and obviously, a bank does not "take positions" in OR. A consequence of this is that, in our opinion, regulators have moved a bit too fast up the hill of the ultimate risk management goal: a unified quantitative capital charge formula across all risk
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   classes. We firmly believe that, before reaching this ultimate goal, we have to walk up and down the quantitative risk management hill a couple of times. The final satisfaction with the results obtained may crucially depend on this.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   What have we learned so far from the various quantitative impact studies (QIS) presented by the regulators (see [18] and [8])? First of all, severity data are very heavy-tailed. Moscadelli [18] even reports infinite-mean models for several of the BLaggregated loss data. Data are furthermore very skewed. Finally, though frequency is no doubt important, it is mainly severity ("the one claim causes ruin"-type of paradigm) that calls the tune. In [18], extreme value theory (EVT) is used for the highquantile estimation of
   <math display="inline">
    F_{L_r}^{\leftarrow}
   </math>
   (0.999). On the other hand, Dutta and Perry [8] question the use of EVT, as the final capital charge may be very unstable with respect to the starting values of the resulting estimation procedure. See
   <math display="inline">
    [5]
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    [19]
   </math>
   for more information on this. Dutta and Perry [8] champion the use of the so-called
   <math display="inline">
    g
   </math>
   -and-
   <math display="inline">
    h
   </math>
   df as a flexible family of loss severity models for OR data. An rv

   <math display="inline">
    [1]
   </math>
   ; in this article, various modeling issues that we had to omit here because of space constraint have been touched upon. For early contributions to the LDA, see for instance [2, 13, 14].

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   So far, we have only briefly mentioned the stochastic modeling of the internal OR loss data. The regulators require a combination of internal with external and expert opinion data. Several companies are providing industrywide OR loss data on which banks can calibrate their internal loss distribution
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   curves. At the moment, it is still early to comment on the validity and the ultimate effect of this. Furthermore, in the realm of OR, expert opinion is called for; it may be borne in mind that we are mainly estimating rare-frequency, high-severity events. As a consequence, a Bayesian approach presents itself. Within the (actuarial) realm of credibility theory, such an approach has for instance been worked out by Bühlmann et al. [4]. For a textbook treatment on credibility theory and its link to empirical Bayes, see [3]. Shevchenko and Wüthrich [21] and Lambrigger
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [16] use the concept of conjugate priors within a Bayesian framework.

    Further Work
   </b>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The brief discussion above hopefully highlights some of the key issues/problems for the Pillar I quantitative modeling of OR. Our main concern is that for such extremely heavy-tailed data, VaR-based risk management is, at best breaking new ground and at worst not really applicable. This brings us to some of the recent research on using VaR as a one-fit-allsize risk management tool. For instance, many banks aggregate data BL-wise, estimate the resulting VaRs,
   <math display="inline">
    \widehat{\text{VaR}}_1, \ldots, \widehat{\text{VaR}}_B
   </math>
   , and add these to obtain
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \text{VaR}_{+} = \sum_{b=1}^{B} \widehat{\text{VaR}}_{b}
   </math>
   (5)
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Then they have to come up with a so-called diversification-based capital reduction argument to yield
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    RC_{\mathbf{OR}}^{T} &lt; VaR_{+} \tag{6}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A more careful look at this issue shows that one is in danger of running head on into the wall of potential nonsubadditivity of the VaR, that is,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \text{VaR} (L_1 + L_2) &gt; \text{VaR} (L_1) + \text{VaR} (L_2) \quad (7)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   in cases important for OR practice; see [19] and the references therein for a discussion on this.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   A related mathematical problem we would like to point out at this point is the following: suppose
   <math display="inline">
    X_1, \ldots, X_d
   </math>
   are d one-period risks,
   <math display="inline">
    \Psi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}
   </math>
   a function corresponding to a financial position
   <math display="inline">
    \Psi(X_1,\ldots,X_d)
   </math>
   , and
   <math display="inline">
    \rho
   </math>
   a risk measure so that we want to calculate (estimate)
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \rho\left(\Psi\left(X_{1},\ldots,X_{d}\right)\right) \tag{8}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Full determination of equation (8) requires the knowledge of the joint df
   <i>
    FX
   </i>
   1
   <i>
    ,...,Xd
   </i>
   which in many cases is not known. As a consequence, only upper and lower bounds on equation (8) can be calculated. This problem is dealt with in [9–11]. In [12], the authors discuss the difference between BL-wide aggregation of the VaR-estimates versus RT-wide aggregation. The final difference very much depends on the specific stochastic properties of the frequencyseverity models for each cell of the OR loss data matrix.

   <b>
    Conclusion
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The Pillar I based quantitative modeling of OR data still has numerous problems: lack of historical data, extreme heavy-tailedness leading to possible superadditivity of the VaR and hence, the questioning of diversification effects based on the VaR, and finally, the overall statistical uncertainty in the modeling of extremes for data of OR type. Before a sufficiently reliable method for OR capital estimation can be found, much more data-oriented work is needed.
