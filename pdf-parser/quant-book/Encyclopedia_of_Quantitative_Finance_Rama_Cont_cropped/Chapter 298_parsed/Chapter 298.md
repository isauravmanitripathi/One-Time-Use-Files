# **Risk Exposures**

Broadly speaking, risk can be defined as the volatility of returns leading to "unexpected losses" (*see* **Valueat-Risk**), with higher volatility indicating higher risk.a The volatility of returns is directly or indirectly influenced by numerous variables, which we called *risk factors*, and by the interaction between these risk factors.

Risk factors can be broadly grouped together into the following categories: market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal and regulatory risk, business risk, strategic risk, and reputation risk [2]. These categories can then be further decomposed into more specific categories, as we show in Figure 1 for market risk and credit risk.

In this figure, we have subdivided market risk into equity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, and commodity price risk in a manner that is in line with our detailed discussion below. Then we have divided interest rate risk into trading risk and the special case of gap risk: the latter relates to the risk that arises in the balance sheet of an institution from the different sensitivities of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates.

In theory, the more all-encompassing the categorization and the more detailed the decomposition, the more closely the company's risk will be captured. In practice, this process is limited by the level of model complexity that can be handled by the available technology and by the cost and availability of internal and market data.

## **Market Risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in financial market prices and rates will reduce the dollar value of a security or a portfolio. Price risk for fixedincome products can be decomposed into a "general market" risk component—the risk that the market as a whole will fall in value—and a "specific" risk component, unique to the particular financial transaction under consideration, that also reflects the credit risk hidden in the instrument. In trading activities, risk arises both from open (unhedged) positions and from imperfect correlations between market positions that are intended to offset one another.

Market risk is given many different names in different contexts. For example, in the case of a fund, the fund may be marketed as tracking the performance of a certain benchmark. In this case, market risk is important to the extent that it creates a "risk of tracking error". *Basis risk* is a term used in the risk management industry to describe the chance of a breakdown in the relationship between the price of a product, on the one hand, and the price of the instrument used to hedge that price exposure, on the other hand. Again, it is really just a context-specific form of market risk.

There are four major types of market risk:

#### **1. Interest rate risk**

The simplest form of interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a fixed-income security will fall as a result of an increase in market interest rates. However, in complex portfolios of interest-rate-sensitive assets, many different kinds of exposure can arise from differences in the maturities, nominal values, and reset dates of instruments and cashflows that are asset like (i.e., "longs") and those that are liability like (i.e., "shorts").

In particular, "curve" risk can arise in portfolios in which long and short positions of different maturities are effectively hedged against a *parallel shift* in yields but not against a change in the *shape of the yield curve*. Meanwhile, even where offsetting positions have the same maturity, basis risk can arise if the rates of the positions are imperfectly correlated. For example, three-month Eurodollar instruments and three-month Treasury bills both naturally pay threemonth interest rates. However, these rates are not perfectly correlated with each other, and spreads between their yields may vary over time. As a result, a three-month Treasury bill funded by three-month Eurodollar deposits represents an imperfect offset or hedged position.

#### **2. Equity price risk**

This is the risk associated with volatility in stock prices. The general market risk of equity refers to the sensitivity of an instrument or portfolio value to a change in the level of broad stock market indices. The "specific" or "idiosyncratic" risk of equity refers to that portion of a stock's price volatility determined by characteristics specific to the firm, such as its line of business, the quality of its management, or a breakdown in its production process. According

to portfolio theory, general market risk cannot be eliminated through portfolio diversification, whereas specific risk can be diversified away.

#### **3. Foreign exchange risk**

Foreign exchange risk arises from open or imperfectly hedged positions in a particular currency. These positions may arise as a natural consequence of business operations, rather than from any conscious desire to take a trading position in a currency. Foreign exchange volatility can sweep away the return from expensive cross-border investments, and at the same time place a firm at a competitive disadvantage in relation to its foreign competitors. It may also generate huge operating losses and, through the uncertainty it causes, inhibit investment. The major drivers of foreign exchange risk are imperfect correlations in the movement of currency prices and fluctuations in international interest rates. Although it is important to acknowledge exchange rates as a distinct market risk factor, the valuation of foreign exchange transactions requires knowledge of the behavior of domestic and foreign interest rates, as well as of spot exchange rates.

#### **4. Commodity price risk**

The price risk of commodities differs considerably from interest rate and foreign exchange risk, since most commodities are traded in markets in which the concentration of supply in the hands of a few suppliers can magnify price volatility. Fluctuations in the depth of trading in the market (i.e., market

liquidity) often accompany and exacerbate high levels of price volatility. Other fundamentals affecting a commodity price include the ease and cost of storage, which varies considerably across the commodity markets (e.g., from gold, to electricity, to wheat). As a result of these factors, commodity prices generally have higher volatilities and larger price discontinuities—that is, moments when prices leap from one level to another—than most traded financial securities. Commodities can be classified according to their characteristics as follows: hard commodities are nonperishable commodities, the markets for which are further divided into precious metals (e.g., gold, silver, and platinum), which have a high price/weight value and base metals (e.g., copper, zinc, and tin); soft commodities or commodities with a short shelf live and that are hard to store, mainly agricultural products (e.g., grains, coffee, and sugar); and energy commodities that consist of oil, gas, electricity, and other energy products.

## **Credit Risk**

Credit risk is the risk that a change in the credit quality of a counterparty will affect the value of a security or a portfolio. Default, whereby a counterparty is unwilling or unable to fulfill its contractual obligations, is the extreme case; however, institutions are also exposed to the risk that a counterparty might be downgraded by a rating agency.

Credit risk is only an issue when the position is an asset, that is, when it exhibits a positive replacement value. In that situation, if the counterparty defaults, the firm loses either all of the market value of the position or, more commonly, the part of the value that it cannot recover following the credit event. (The value it is likely to recover is called the *recovery value* or *recovery rate* when expressed as a percentage; the amount it is expected to lose is called the *loss given default*.)

Unlike the potential loss given default on coupon bonds or loans, the one on derivative positions is usually much lower than the nominal amount of the deal, and in many cases is only a fraction of this amount. This is because the economic value of a derivative instrument is related to its replacement or market value rather than its nominal or face value. However, the credit exposures induced by the replacement values of derivative instruments are dynamic: they can be negative at one point in time, and yet become positive at a later point in time after market conditions have changed. Therefore, firms must examine not only the current exposure measured by the current replacement value but also the profile of potential future exposures up to the termination of the deal.

# **Liquidity Risk**

Liquidity risk comprises both "funding liquidity risk" and "asset liquidity risk", though these two dimensions of liquidity risk are closely related. Funding liquidity risk relates to a firm's ability to raise the necessary cash to roll over its debt, to meet the cash, margin and collateral requirements of counterparties, and (in the case of funds) to satisfy capital withdrawals. Funding liquidity risk can be managed through holding cash and cash equivalents, setting credit lines in place, and through monitoring "buying power". (Buying powers refers to the amount a trading counterparty can borrow against assets under stressed market conditions.)

Asset liquidity risk, often simply called *liquidity risk*, is the risk that an institution will not be able to execute a transaction at the prevailing market price because there is, temporarily, no appetite for the deal on the "other side" of the market. If the transaction cannot be postponed, its execution may lead to substantial loss on the position. This risk is generally very hard to quantify.

## **Operational Risk**

Operational risk (*see* **Operational Risk**) refers to *potential losses* resulting from inadequate systems, management failure, faulty controls, fraud, and human error.b Many of the large losses from derivative trading over the last decade are the direct consequence of operational failures. Derivative trading is more prone to operational risk than cash transactions because derivatives are, by their nature, leveraged transactions. The valuation of complex derivatives also creates considerable operational risk. Very tight controls are an absolute necessity if a firm is to avoid large losses.

Operational risk includes "fraud", for example, when a trader or other employee intentionally falsifies and misrepresents the risks incurred in a transaction. Technology risk, and principally computer systems risk, also falls into the operational risk category.

*Human factor risk* is a special form of operational risk. It relates to the losses that may result from human errors such as pushing the wrong button on a computer, inadvertently destroying a file, or entering the wrong value for the parameter input of a model.

## **Legal and Regulatory Risk**

Legal and regulatory risk arises for a whole variety of reasons and is closely related to reputation risk (see below). For example, a counterparty might lack the legal or regulatory authority to engage in a risky transaction. In the derivative markets, legal risks often only become apparent when a counterparty, or an investor, loses money on a transaction and decides to sue the provider firm to avoid meeting its obligations. Another aspect of regulatory risk is the potential impact of a change in tax law on the market value of a position. For example, when the British government changed the tax code to remove a particular tax benefit during the summer of 1997, one major investment bank suffered huge losses.

## **Business Risk**

Business risk refers to the classic risks of the world of business such as uncertainty about the demand for products, or the price that can be charged for those products, or the cost of producing and delivering products.

In the world of manufacturing, business risk is largely managed through core tasks of management, for example, choices about channel, products, suppliers, how products are marketed, and so on.

However, there remains the question of how business risk should be addressed within formal risk management frameworks and that have become prevalent in the financial industries.

Although business risks should surely be assessed and monitored, it is not obvious how to do this in a way that complements the banking industry's treatment of classic credit and market risks. There is also room for debate over whether business risks need to be supported by capital in the same explicit way (*see* **Economic Capital**). In the new Basel Capital Accord (*see* **Regulatory Capital**), "business risk" is excluded from the regulators' definition of operational risk, even though some researchers believe it to be a greater source of volatility in bank revenue than the operational event/failure risk that the regulators *have* included within bank minimum capital requirements.

Business risk is affected by such factors as the quality of the strategy and/ or the reputation of the firm as well as other factors. Therefore, it is common practice to view strategic and reputation risks as components of business risk and the risk literature sometimes refers to a complex of business/strategic/reputation risk. In this typology, we differentiate these three components.

## **Strategic Risk**

Strategic risk refers to the risk of significant investments for which there is a high uncertainty about success and profitability. If the venture is not successful, then the firm will usually suffer a major write-off and its reputation among investors will be damaged.

# **Reputation Risk**

Reputation risk is taking on a new dimension after the accounting scandals that defrauded the shareholders, bondholders, and employees of many major corporations during the boom in the equity markets in the late 1990s. Investigations into the mutual funds and insurance industry by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer have also made clear just how important a reputation for fair dealing is with both customers and regulators. In a survey released in August 2004 by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), 34% of the 134 international bank respondents believed that reputation risk is the biggest risk to market and shareholder value faced by banks, while market and credit risk scored only 25% each.

No doubt this was partly because corporate scandals like Enron, Worldcom, and others were still fresh in bankers' minds. Some experts, however, believe that reputation is a genuine emerging issue, and that the new Basel Capital Accord will help to shift the attention of regulators and investors from quantifiable risks like market and credit risk toward strategic and business risk.

Reputation risk poses a special threat to financial institutions because the nature of their business requires the confidence of customers, creditors, regulators, and the general market place. The development of a wide array of structured finance products, including financial derivatives for market and credit risk, asset-backed securities with customized cash flows, and specialized financial conduits that manage pools of purchased assets, has placed pressure on the interpretation of accounting and tax rules, and, in turn, has given rise to significant concerns about the legality and appropriateness of certain transactions. Involvement in such transactions may damage an institution's reputation and franchise value.

Financial institutions are also under increasing pressure to demonstrate their ethical, social, and environmental responsibility. As a defensive mechanism, 10 international banks from seven countries announced in June 2003 the adoption of the "Equator Principles", a voluntary set of guidelines developed by the banks for managing social and environmental issues related to the financing of projects in emerging countries. The Equator Principles are based on the policy and guidelines of the World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) and require the borrower to conduct an environmental assessment for high-risk projects to address issues such as sustainable development and use of renewable natural resources, protection of human health, pollution prevention and waste minimization, socioeconomic impact, and so on.

Banks should clearly monitor and manage risks to their reputation. However, as for business risk, there is no clear industrial view on whether these risks can be meaningfully *measured* or whether they should be supported by risk capital. In the case of reputation risk, the problem is compounded: a bank that reserves money against the danger of reputation damage may be tacitly admitting in advance that its conduct is reprehensible.
