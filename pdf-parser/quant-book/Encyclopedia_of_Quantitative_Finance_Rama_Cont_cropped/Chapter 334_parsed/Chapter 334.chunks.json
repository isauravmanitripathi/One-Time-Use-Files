Garman models continuous trading with a market maker, or dealer, who smooths out temporary imbalances in other traders' orders to buy and sell securities. In Garman's model there is a single risk-neutral, monopolistic dealer who faces stochastic order arrival. The dealer has no ability to borrow either cash or securities, and he sets prices at which he is willing to sell (ask price) and buy (bid price) only once, before trading begins. The dealer's objective is to maximize his expected profit per unit of time subject to avoiding bankruptcy or failure. This formulation gives rise to a classic gambler's ruin problem. By setting his ask price higher than his bid price (a positive <b>bid–ask spread</b>), the dealer protects himself from certain failure, although he still faces a positive probability of failure. A key contribution of Garman's model is the idea that a dealer's inventory affects his viability. A limitation of his model is that all prices are set before trading begins; the dealer cannot adjust his prices as his inventory changes.</p>",

As in Garman's model, there is a single risk-neutral, monopolistic dealer whose objective is to maximize expected profit, but Amihud and Mendelson assume that inventory is bounded above and below by exogenous parameters, eliminating the possibility of dealer failure. This allows a tighter focus on the dealer's optimization problem. This model incorporates a semi-<b>Markov process</b> in which inventory is the state variable. The decision variables (bid and ask prices) depend on the level of the state variable (inventory)—thus the bid and ask prices change over time as the level of inventory changes. Amihud and Mendelson's model predicts that the dealer's optimal ask price is above his bid price, but in this model the positive spread reflects the dealer's market power. (Extending the model to include competitive dealers would drive the spread to zero.) In addition, Amihud and Mendelson find that the dealer has a preferred or target inventory position, and he adjusts his prices to return to his target inventory. If the dealer is too long, to reduce inventory toward his target level he lowers both the bid and ask prices to induce other traders to buy. The reverse is true if the dealer is below his target inventory: To raise inventory toward its target level the market maker raises both the bid and ask prices to induce other traders to sell. Amihud and Mendelson's model thus predicts that the level of bid and ask prices is a monotonically decreasing function of the dealer's inventory. In the special case of linear supply and demand, higher inventory leads to wider spreads.</p>",

The dealer is willing to alter his portfolio away from his desired position to accommodate the trading desires of others. The dealer is risk averse and cannot hedge his inventory exposure, so he must be compensated for bearing the risk of changing his portfolio from his target level. In these models the spread between bid and ask prices arises as compensation for the portfolio risk borne by a risk-averse dealer. Inventory causes the dealer to move both bid and ask prices up (if he is below his target portfolio) or down (if he is above his target portfolio) by the same amount, so inventory affects the level of bid and ask prices but not the magnitude of the spread between them.

      "html": "<p block-type=\"Text\">Brunnermeier and Pedersen [2] construct a model linking an asset's market liquidity with market makers' funding, explicitly acknowledging that market makers generally cannot raise new capital instantly. In this model, market makers are risk neutral and their objective is to maximize final wealth, subject to the constraint that the total margin (the amount of capital required to finance their inventory positions) cannot exceed their capital. Brunnermeier and Pedersen show that when market makers' margin requirements approach their available capital, market makers provide less liquidity to the market and bid–ask spreads widen. This model thus predicts that very large inventory positions lead to wider spreads, in contrast to the capital-unconstrained models in which inventories have no effect on the magnitude of bid–ask spreads. Further, Brunnermeier and Pedersen predict that when large inventory positions push market makers close to their capital limits, market makers provide liquidity mostly in lower-risk securities, causing a \"flight to quality\" in which risky securities become especially illiquid.</p>",

Inventory models predict that dealers set ask prices above bid prices, that they lower their quotes when they have very large inventory positions, and that they may or may not change the magnitude of their quoted spreads as their inventory changes, depending on the particular modeling assumptions. Multidealer inventory models further predict that relative inventory positions give rise to interdealer trading and determine which dealers have the best (lowest ask or highest bid) quotes in a market. These predictions have been tested and largely borne out in empirical studies to date, but the difficulty of obtaining data on dealer inventories has limited researchers' ability to test the models in some of the largest dealer markets, such as the fixed income market.</p>",
