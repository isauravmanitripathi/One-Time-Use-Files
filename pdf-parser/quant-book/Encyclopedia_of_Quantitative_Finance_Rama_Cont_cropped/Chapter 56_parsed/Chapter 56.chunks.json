After investigating the risk– return trade-off and the selection of optimal portfolios, instructors find it natural to go on to raise the question of what information is incorporated in the estimates of risk and expected return that underlie portfolio choices. Information that is \"fully reflected\" in security prices (and therefore in investors' estimates of expected return and risk) cannot be used to construct successful trading rules, which are defined as those with an abnormally high expected return for a given risk. In contrast, information that is not fully reflected in security prices can be so used. Students appear to find this material plausible and intuitive, and this is the basis of its appeal. Best of all, the idea of capital market efficiency appears not to depend on the validity of particular models, implying that students can grasp the major ideas without wading through the details of finance models.</p>",

To see this, consider the assertion of Fama [8] that capital market efficiency can only be tested in conjunction with a particular model of returns. This statement implies that there exist two independent sources of restrictions on the data that are being tested jointly: the assumed model and market efficiency. Analysts who are used to deriving all restrictions being tested from the assumed model find this puzzling: what is the additional source of information that is separate from the model?</p>",

The log-linearized present-value relation (1) is not a theoretical model with the potential to explain price volatility. Rather, it is very close to an identity (the only respect in which equation (1) imposes substantive restrictions lies in the assumption that the infinite sums converge; this rules out bubbles). The Campbell-Shiller exercise amounts to decomposing price variation into dividend variation, return variation, and a covariance term and observing that the latter two terms are not negligible quantitatively. This, although useful, is a restatement of the variance-bounds result, not an explanation of it. Explaining excess volatility would involve accounting in economic terms for the fact that expected returns have the time structure that they do. Campbell and Shiller have not done</p>",

Rather than identifying market efficiency with the proposition that investors have rational expectations—alternatively, with the decision to model investors as having rational expectations—one can associate market efficiency with the proposition that asset prices behave as one would expect if security markets were entirely frictionless. In such markets, prices respond quickly to information, implying that investors cannot use publicly available information to construct profitable trading rules because that information is reflected in security prices as soon as it becomes available. In contrast, the presence of major frictions in asset markets is held to imply that prices may respond slowly to information. In that case, the frictions prevent investors from exploiting the resulting trading opportunities.</p>",

In the theory of investment, it is sometimes assumed that investment in capital goods induces costs that motivate firms to change quantities—in this case, physical capital—more slowly than they would otherwise. It appears natural to assume that prices are similar. For example, real estate prices are held to respond slowly to relevant information because the costs implied by the illiquidity of real estate preclude the arbitrages that would otherwise bring about rapid price adjustment.</p>",

It is correct that, if prices respond slowly to information, investors may be unable to construct the trades that exploit the mispricing because of frictions. This, however, does not establish that markets clear in settings where prices adjust slowly. Equilibrium models that characterize asset prices in the presence of frictions suggest that in equilibrium prices respond quickly to shocks, just as in the absence of frictions.

Lintner [18] and Miller [21], among others, proposed that short sale restrictions cause securities to trade at higher prices than they would otherwise. This is held to occur because investors with negative information may be unable to trade based on their information, whereas those with positive information can buy without restriction. Empirical evidence is held to support this result [5, 10, 22]. Lim showed that this outcome will not occur if investors have rational expectations about the extent of short sales restrictions. Under rational expectations, prices in Lim's model follow a martingale under the natural probabilities (reflecting assumed risk neutrality), just as they would in the absence of short sales restrictions.</p>",
