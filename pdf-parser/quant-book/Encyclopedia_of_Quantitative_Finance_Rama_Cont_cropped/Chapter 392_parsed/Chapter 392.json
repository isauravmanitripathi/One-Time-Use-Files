From a solvency perspective, the aim of the theory is to determine the amount of capital required to ensure that the probability of continued solvency (i.e., nonruin) up to some chosen time horizon is as high as desired. There are discrete and continuous time versions of the theory and the time horizon can be either finite or infinite. Ruin theory can definitely provide insight into the insurance process. However, its concentration on a single source of risk leads it to be most applicable to nonlife or general insurance and of much less use in life insurance (<i>see</i> <b>Life Insurance</b>) where financial risks play a much larger role. The theory is structured to calculate the probability of ruin given the initial available capital.

Although many jurisdictions required insurers to have a minimum amount of capital before being licensed to carry on the business of insurance, there were often no requirements that insurers had to maintain specific capital levels. In those jurisdictions where insurance companies were required to maintain capital of a uniform monetary amount, that amount usually did not vary by the size of the company, the nature of its portfolio of policies issued, its financial experience and condition, or its method of operation.</p>",

The focus was upon excessively high claim frequency and severity. A second important step was the introduction, in the First Insurance Directive of the European Union, of a capital requirement for life insurance companies that was calculated in two parts: a fixed percentage of mathematical reserves and a smaller percentage of the net amount at risk. The portion related to mathematical reserves was meant to provide for credit and market risks related to the assets supporting these liabilities while the second portion was meant to provide for insurance (claims) risk.</p>",

Further developments in this direction required a systematic study and listing of these sources of risk. The Committee on Valuation and Related Problems of the Society of Actuaries carried out one of the earliest such studies; its report was published in 1979 [4]. The committee suggested that risk could be categorized in three parts and that capital, or contingency reserves, could be provided for each part. The parts are C1, asset depreciation; C2, pricing inadequacy; and C3, interest-rate fluctuation (<i>see</i> <b>Bond</b> and <b>Term Structure Models</b>). In more modern terms, these would now be called C1, <i>credit risk</i>; C2, <i>insurance risk</i>; C3, <i>asset/liability mismatch risk</i>.</p>",

By 1989, a test calculation had been established. This was subject to extensive field tests in the life insurance industry and became a regulatory requirement in 1992; it is known as the <i>Minimum Continuing Capital and Surplus</i> <i>Requirement</i> (MCCSR) [9]. A similar requirement was not established for Canadian property and casualty (general) insurers until 2002 [10]. In the United States, following an increase in the number of failures of insurance companies due to economic experience in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) began work on a similar capital requirement for life insurers. The structure of the NAIC formula, known widely as <i>risk-based capital</i> (RBC), follows the committee's categorization and was quite similar to the Canadian formulation. Both national requirements have evolved independently; although they remain similar, there are significant differences between them. Shortly after it established the life insurance company formula, the NAIC introduced a capital requirement for property and casualty insurers. It has since introduced a separate requirement for health insurers.</p>",

Each insurer is expected to have the ability to assess its own view of its capital needs, its economic capital. This assessment will usually be made with an internal model. The FSA may ask insurers to submit their models for examination. This is not a formal model approval. Rather, the FSA examines the model to ensure it covers all significant sources of risk for the particular firm and provides its views to the firm as individual capital guidance.</p>",
