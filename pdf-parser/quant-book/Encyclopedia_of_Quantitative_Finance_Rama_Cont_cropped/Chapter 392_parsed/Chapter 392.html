    Capital Requirements
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Capital, most often, is the sum of contributed capital and retained earnings. In modern times, financial economics has developed a variety of other instruments to supply capital to companies. Capital is often referred to in the insurance industry as
   <i>
    surplus
   </i>
   . Whatever term is used to describe the concept (we shall here use the term
   <i>
    capital
   </i>
   ), a primary concern is the amount of capital that must be held.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The amount of required capital will depend upon the methods used to determine policy liabilities within financial reporting since different methods provide varying degrees of conservatism that can be applied to offset risk and required capital. Therefore, a change in financial reporting may necessitate alteration of capital requirements.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Determination of required capital involves consideration of a number of factors including the time over which solvency is to be protected (the "time horizon"), the degree of probability to which future solvency is to be maintained, and the scope of threats to future solvency (the "risks") to be considered in the calculation. The usual approach is to consider a variety of important risks; hence modern capital requirements are usually termed
   <i>
    risk based
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The initial and historical approach to solvency and required capital is through ruin theory (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Ruin Theory
   </b>
   and [8]). Here, the only source of risk considered is the insurance claims process. From a solvency perspective, the aim of the theory is to determine the amount of capital required to ensure that the probability of continued solvency (i.e., nonruin) up to some chosen time horizon is as high as desired. There are discrete and continuous time versions of the theory and the time horizon can be either finite or infinite. Ruin theory can definitely provide insight into the insurance process. However, its concentration on a single source of risk leads it to be most applicable to nonlife or general insurance and of much less use in life insurance (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Life Insurance
   </b>
   ) where financial risks play a much larger role. The theory is structured to calculate the probability of ruin given the initial available capital. The calculations are difficult and the theory has not often been applied in practice although it was

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An important advance came in the early 1980s with the availability of high-speed computers and the development of models of the insurance process that could be used to simulate an insurer's financial progress. The leading work in this area was carried out in Finland by Pentikainen and his colleagues [11]. ¨ To construct their model, this group first extended classical risk theory to include a number of significant variables, in addition to the claims process. This work is described in [12]. An extended, more modern, and readily available description of this approach can be found in [2].
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    Regulatory Approach to Solvency
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Insurance regulators and supervisors are primarily charged with protecting the interests of policyholders and others holding contracts issued by insurance companies. They are clearly interested in insurers' solvency. Historically, the emphasis in statutory financial reporting was on a conservative valuation of policy liabilities as a means of maintaining solvency. Although many jurisdictions required insurers to have a minimum amount of capital before being licensed to carry on the business of insurance, there were often no requirements that insurers had to maintain specific capital levels. In those jurisdictions where insurance companies were required to maintain capital of a uniform monetary amount, that amount usually did not vary by the size of the company, the nature of its portfolio of policies issued, its financial experience and condition, or its method of operation.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The earliest development of more modern riskbased capital requirements began in Finland in the 1940s; the determination of an insurer's required capital was based upon ruin theory. The focus was upon excessively high claim frequency and severity. A second important step was the introduction, in the First Insurance Directive of the European Union, of a capital requirement for life insurance companies that was calculated in two parts: a fixed percentage of mathematical reserves and a smaller percentage of the net amount at risk. The portion related to mathematical reserves was meant to provide for credit and market risks related to the assets supporting these liabilities while the second portion was meant to provide for insurance (claims) risk.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Both the Finnish and the European innovations represent an effort to relate a company's capital requirement to the risks to which it is exposed. Further developments in this direction required a systematic study and listing of these sources of risk. The Committee on Valuation and Related Problems of the Society of Actuaries carried out one of the earliest such studies; its report was published in 1979 [4]. The committee suggested that risk could be categorized in three parts and that capital, or contingency reserves, could be provided for each part. The parts are C1, asset depreciation; C2, pricing inadequacy; and C3, interest-rate fluctuation (
   <i>

   </i>
   <b>
    Bond
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    Term Structure Models
   </b>
   ). In more modern terms, these would now be called C1,
   <i>
    credit risk
   </i>
   ; C2,
   <i>
    insurance risk
   </i>
   ; C3,
   <i>
    asset/liability mismatch risk
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Work on the first modern risk-based capital requirement began in Canada in 1984, based upon the committee's categorization. By 1989, a test calculation had been established. This was subject to extensive field tests in the life insurance industry and became a regulatory requirement in 1992; it is known as the
   <i>
    Minimum Continuing Capital and Surplus Requirement
   </i>
   (MCCSR) [9]. A similar requirement was not established for Canadian property and casualty (general) insurers until 2002 [10]. In the United States, following an increase in the number of failures of insurance companies due to economic experience in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) began work on a similar capital requirement for life insurers. The structure of the NAIC formula, known widely as
   <i>
    risk-based capital
   </i>
   (RBC), follows the committee's categorization and was quite similar to the Canadian formulation. Both national requirements have evolved independently; although they remain similar, there are significant differences between them. Shortly after it established the life insurance company formula, the NAIC introduced a capital requirement for property and casualty insurers. It has since introduced a separate requirement for health insurers.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A number of other jurisdictions have adopted regulatory capital requirements for insurance companies. These tend to follow the North American formulations.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The development of the more comprehensive insurance regulatory capital requirements was parallel to but independent of the similar development of a requirement for banks under the Basel Accord (

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>

   </b>
   ). Although these developments occurred independently, future prospects are that the banking and insurance capital requirements will eventually have a strong influence on each other. This is due to two factors: the recent emergence of large financial conglomerates or groups that engage in both banking and insurance, and the trend in many countries to form integrated regulators/supervisors that oversee both industries. The formerly distinct cultures of banking and insurance are thereby influencing each other both in business and government.

   <b>
    Developments in Regulatory Capital since 2000
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen a great deal of activity and advances in capital requirements and solvency. This is due to an increased appreciation of the risks faced by financial institutions, a heightened awareness of their need for capital, the emergence of the discipline of enterprise risk management, the drive to establish uniform international financial reporting standards (IFRS) by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and regulatory moves, on a worldwide basis, by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and in Europe by the European Union, to establish international supervisory standards.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Since its formation in the middle 1980s, the IAIS has been developing a series of papers on best practices for insurance supervisors. Solvency regulation and supervision has naturally been a major focus of IAIS activities [6]. In preparation for the development of papers on capital requirements, the IAIS asked the International Actuarial Association (IAA) for technical assistance. In 2002, the IAA formed its Insurer Solvency Assessment Working Party, which produced its report [5] in 2004. The IAIS continues to develop its series of papers on this topic.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The IAA report has become the conceptual basis for much of the recent work on insurance capital requirements. This is particularly the case with respect to work being done in Europe under the Solvency II project. The results of this project, a Europewide unified approach to insurance financial reporting and solvency supervision, is expected to come into effect in 2011. At the time of writing, the exact form of the Solvency II capital requirements has not been
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   fixed. The Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pension Supervisors (CEIOPS), which has been charged with development of these requirements, has been conducting a series of qualitative impact studies that seek industry tests of proposed formulations of these requirements.

   <b>
    Advanced Approaches and Internal Models
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An important feature of the Solvency II proposed capital requirement is the availability of an advanced approach for technically advanced insurers. Under this approach, insurers will determine their required capital using internal models that have been approved by supervisors. To be permitted to adopt this approach, insurers must satisfy a number of conditions involving not only the model itself but also the quality of implementation and execution of the insurer's risk management program. In particular, insurers will be required to satisfy a "use test" and show that the internal model is used within the firm's operations. This test is intended to assure that insurers have sufficient confidence in the quality and accuracy of their models.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Internal models have been used as part of the MCCSR and RBC requirements in Canada and the United States, respectively. In particular, they have been applied to the liability valuation and capital requirements for certain financial guarantees that insurers offer in connection with certain (variable annuity) investment contracts. They have also been used for banking capital requirements under the Basel Accord, initially with respect to market risk in the trading book and more lately, under Basel II [1], with respect to credit and operational risks (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Regulatory Capital
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    Operational Risk
   </b>
   ).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Use of an advanced approach is likely to often produce lower capital requirements than would be produced by a standard and generally conservative regulatory formula. Supervisors justify accepting reduced capital because they require the financial institution to have a strong risk management program before being allowed to adopt an advanced approach.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The use of internal models was anticipated in the IAA report [5]. More recently the IAIS has published a standard and a paper on internal models, primarily directed to supervisors [7]. The IAA is preparing a companion paper directed to practitioners who construct and operate these models.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    Beyond Regulatory Capital Requirements
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The supervision of solvency extends beyond regulatory capital requirements. Many supervisors have adopted a structure that resembles one laid out in Basel II. The structure is described in terms of three Pillars: Pillar 1—Minimum Capital Requirements, Pillar 2—Supervisory Review Process, and Pillar 3—Market Discipline. The discussion heretofore has centered on Pillar 1. These are described in detail in [1].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An interesting feature of Pillar 2 involves the assessment of an insurer's capital adequacy, extending beyond minimum Pillar 1 requirements. An early and trail-blazing approach has been taken by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) of the United Kingdom with the introduction of individual capital adequacy assessment [3]. Each insurer is expected to have the ability to assess its own view of its capital needs, its economic capital. This assessment will usually be made with an internal model. The FSA may ask insurers to submit their models for examination. This is not a formal model approval. Rather, the FSA examines the model to ensure it covers all significant sources of risk for the particular firm and provides its views to the firm as individual capital guidance.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The third Pillar is based upon the notion that market discipline will act to force an insurer to operate its business in a sound and prudential manner, thus stimulating a convergence between the interests of the firm, its policyholders, and its supervisors. Supervisors' primary activity in this area centers on encouraging and/or requiring firms to publicly disclose information that is required by policyholders and investors to assess the firm's condition.

  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Much of the thrust for improved capital requirements and risk management has come from the regulatory/supervisory sector. However, many insurers, particularly the larger and multinational firms, have undertaken their own initiatives to develop economic capital requirements and to apply them as an integral part of their business operations. In addition, these firms have adopted many ideas and practices from the growing field of enterprise risk management. The role of the chief risk officer has gained considerable
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   importance within these insurers. Many of the responsibilities that were formally assigned to the company actuary have been assumed by the chief risk officer. Economic capital and risk management have become the firm's operational tools to measure and control the risk of its own insolvency.
