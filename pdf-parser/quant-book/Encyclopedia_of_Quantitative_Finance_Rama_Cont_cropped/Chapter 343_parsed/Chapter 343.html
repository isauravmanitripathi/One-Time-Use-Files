    Limit Order Markets
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The organization of trading in financial markets has undergone tremendous changes at the end of the twentieth century. In stock markets, electronic limit order books have progressively replaced floor and dealership markets. For instance, the Paris Bourse closed its floor and became a fully electronic limit order market in 1986. Bond and currency markets follow a similar evolution with the emergence of trading platforms such as EBS (FX) or E.speed and MTS (bond markets). This evolution has been a major impetus for academic research on limit order markets. This article provides a brief review of this research.

   Limit orders and market orders (

   <b>
    Order Types
   </b>
   ) are the core engine of limit order markets. Limit orders specify a price and a number of shares. For instance, a limit order to buy (respectively sell) 500 shares of stock XYZ at $10 means that the order submitter is willing to buy up to 500 shares at $10 or less (respectively more). As they have a prespecified price, limit orders cannot always be matched with contra-side orders upon arrival. In this case, they are stored in a limit order book. They exit the limit order book when they are hit by subsequent orders or cancelled by the order submitter.

   A market order specifies a number of shares to buy or to sell with no price limit. It is matched upon arrival with contra-side limit orders (e.g., a buy market order is matched with sell limit orders). The latter execute in sequence according to price priority and other rules (e.g., first-in first-out) for orders tied at the same price. Consider, for instance, the arrival of a buy market order for 1000 shares when the limit order book features sell limit orders at (i) $10 (best ask price) for 500 shares, (ii) $10.5 for 700 shares, and (iii) $10.7 for 200 shares. The market order executes for 500 shares at $10 and for the remaining 500 shares at the next best offer, $10.5. Execution of limit orders is "discriminatory" in the sense that each limit order is filled at its own price.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Copeland and Galai [12] point out that limit orders are similar to options. For instance, a buy (sell) limit order at $10 is similar to a put (respectively

  <p block-type="Text">
   call) option with a $10 strike price. Indeed, it gives the possibility to other market participants to sell the security at $10 when its value falls below $10. These options are free. Yet, they can be written at a profit because, in contrast to regular options, they are sometimes exercised out-of-the money by traders who need immediate execution. Bid and ask prices can then be viewed as the strike prices that balance losses when limit orders execute in-the-money (are "picked off") with gains when they execute outof-the money [12]. Foucault
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [18] argue, and show empirically, that the limit order book contains information on future price volatility since limit orders are options.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Limit order traders can reduce the likelihood of being picked off by monitoring their orders. Foucault
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [19] analyze this monitoring decision in a model similar to that in [12]. Liu [32] extends this model to study the interactions between monitoring decisions and cancellations in a limit order market. He provides evidence that traders submitting limit orders actively monitor their orders to reduce the risk of being picked off.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The choice between limit and market orders hinges upon a trade-off between the gain of a limit order (a price improvement relative to standing quotes) and its costs, namely, the cost of nonexecution, the cost of being picked off, the cost of trading with better informed investors, monitoring costs, waiting costs [14], and submission fees. Harris and Hasbrouck [24] study the performance of actual limit orders. They find that buy (respectively sell) limit orders execute more frequently in the case of a price decline (respectively increase). Moreover, they also find that the opportunity cost of unfilled limit orders behind the best quotes is significant. Handa and Schwartz [23] use hypothetical limit and market orders. They find that the performance of filled (respectively unfilled) limit orders is higher (respectively smaller) than that of market orders. Unconditionally, the performance of each order type is identical. Overall, these findings suggest that the cost of being picked off and the cost of nonexecution are significant.

   The optimal order submission strategy depends on each trader's objective (e.g., whether the trader is constrained to trade a specific number of shares or not), his/her expectation regarding future order submissions, and the current state of the book. In turn, traders' orders affect the state of the book and future order submission choices. Biais

   first empirical description of the interactions between the state of the limit order book and the order flow in a pure limit order market (the Paris Bourse). They uncover a
   <i>
    diagonal effect
   </i>
   : the frequency of an order of a given type (e.g., a buy market order) conditional on an order of the same type is higher than the unconditional frequency of this order. This observation is confirmed by subsequent empirical analyses of other markets [22, 35]. Biais
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [6] also show that order submission strategies depend on the state of the limit order book in systematic ways. These observations paved the road for research about the effect of the state of the limit order book (e.g., the size of the bid–ask spread, the depth at the best quotes, etc.) on order submission choices (see, for instance, Beber, A. &amp; Caglio, C. (2004).

   [1] study the interactions between order submissions and transitory volatility. They find that traders use limit orders more frequently after a rise in transitory volatility. One possibility is that this increase in volatility reflects an increase in the bid–ask spread due to transient liquidity pressures. This increase in the bid–ask spread attracts limit order traders as providing liquidity becomes more profitable. Consistent with this interpretation, Biais
   <i>
    et al.

   [6] find reversals in the size of bid–ask spreads after the arrival of large market orders. The speed of this reversal determines the resiliency of a limit order market to liquidity shocks and constitutes one important dimension of market liquidity. Degryse

    Models of Price Formation in Limit Order Markets and Empirical Tests

   The limit order book can be described by the mapping between quotes in the book and the cumulative
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   quantity available at these quotes (e.g., in the previous example, the cumulative quantity offered for sale is 500 shares at $10, 1200 shares at $10.5, and 1400 shares at $10.7). Naturally, a strand of research on limit order markets focuses on this mapping as it determines the cost of execution for traders submitting market orders and thereby market liquidity. In the previous example, execution costs are smaller other things being equal if the limit order book features, say, a cumulative quantity of 1200 shares at $10.5 instead of only, say, 600 shares.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Glosten [20] considers a model in which some traders submitting market orders can be better informed on the payoff of a risky security than traders submitting limit orders. He shows that the quotes associated with a given cumulative quantity are equal to limit order traders' expectation regarding the payoff of the security conditional on the size of the next market order being larger than this cumulative quantity. For instance, if
   <i>
    V
   </i>
   is the payoff of the risky security,
   <i>
    Q(A)
   </i>
   is the cumulative quantity offered at the ask price
   <i>
    A
   </i>
   , and
   <i>

   Thus, ask prices are upper tail conditional expectations. By symmetry, bid prices are lower tail expectations. This feature is closely related to the discriminatory execution of limit orders and does not obtain in earlier models of trading with asymmetric information [29]. It implies that buy market orders execute at a mark-up compared to sell market orders, even if the size of these orders is infinitesimal. That is, there is "
   <i>
    small trade bid ask spread

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Glosten [20] assumes perfect competition among limit order traders. Thus, the restrictions on quotes and cumulative quantities (e.g., equation (1)) derive from a zero profit condition for limit orders. Biais
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [7] provide a more general analysis allowing for imperfect competition (see also [5]). Seppi [38], Viswanathan and Wang [40], and Parlour and Seppi [34] study the mapping between quotes and cumulative quantities in limit order markets in models without asymmetric information.

   These models are static. Hence, they are silent on the determinants of the choice between market and limit orders. Cohen

   </i>
   [17], Rosu [36], and Large [31] introduce dynamic models of trading in limit order markets in which execution probabilities are consistent with order submission choices in equilibrium. These models explain variation in order submission choices by variations in the state of the book and traders' valuations for the security. Traders with high valuations submit more aggressive buy orders and traders with low valuations submit more aggressive sell orders. Thus, traders with extreme valuations are more likely to submit market orders and traders with intermediate valuations are more likely to submit limit orders.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Parlour [33] studies a one tick market. Upon arrival, buyers (respectively sellers) choose to submit a limit order at the bid (respectively ask) price or a market order. In this model, limit orders face a risk of nonexecution. In equilibrium, traders' order placement decisions depend on the state of the limit order book on
   <i>
    both
   </i>
   sides. For instance, the decision to submit a buy limit order depends on the depth on the ask side because this depth will affect future sellers' order submission choices. Moreover, the equilibrium features systematic patterns on order submissions. For instance, a sell market order is more likely after a sell market order than after a buy market order as found empirically in [6].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Foucault [16] focuses on the effect of price volatility on order submission choices. In this model, traders' valuations for the security are distributed around a consensus value that follows a random walk. Thus, changes in traders' valuations are positively correlated with changes in the consensus value. Consequently, buy (respectively sell) limit orders are more likely to execute when the consensus value decreases (respectively increases) than when it increases (respectively decreases). For this reason, limit orders are exposed to the risk of being picked off. Under simplifying assumptions (e.g., limit orders expire after one period), Foucault [16] characterizes order submission strategies
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   in closed-form. In equilibrium, the fraction of limit orders in the order flow and the bid–ask spread increase with the volatility of the consensus value. In contrast, limit orders fill rate decreases with volatility since market orders are less frequent when the bid-ask spread is large. Van Achter extends this model by considering the case in which limit orders have longer time to expiration (Van Achter, M. (2006).

   [17] study the determinants of expected time to execution and the speed at which the bid–ask spread reverts to competitive levels after liquidity shocks.

   <i>

   [21] relax many of these assumptions while retaining the idea that changes in traders' valuations and the consensus value drive variations in order submission choices. They use techniques from computational economics to numerically calculate the equilibrium of the limit order market for specific parameter values. They find that the diagonal effect is an equilibrium property of the limit order market. It arises because (i) there is persistence in the state of the limit order book (hence, traders submit similar orders) and (ii) it takes time for traders to take advantage of stale limit orders after large changes in the consensus value (as initially suggested by Hollifield

   Do the trade-offs considered in theories of limit order markets explain actual order submissions? Sandas [37] tackles this question by testing restric- ˚ tions implied by Glosten's [20] model for quotes, cumulative quantities, and changes in transaction prices using data from the Stockholm Stock Exchange. He rejects the model because actual limit order books are not deep enough to be explained by the

  <p block-type="Text">

Another, related, possibility is that it takes time for the limit order book to replenish after liquidity shocks. Thus, trades occur when profit opportunities remain in the limit order book.

   be observed for each state of the limit order book because they are suboptimal for all traders (whatever be their valuation). They build a test of the model by tracking these suboptimal orders. They reject the model because the expected payoffs on limit orders with low execution probabilities are too small compared to the expected payoffs of limit orders with higher execution probabilities. Thus, these limit orders with low execution probabilities should not be observed according to the model.

   Despite their widespread use in financial markets, little is known on the allocative efficiency of limit order markets. Empiricists often use measures of bid–ask spreads as a proxy for efficiency, presuming that larger bid–ask spreads are associated with greater inefficiencies. However, Goettler

   A related question is the performance of limit order markets relative to other market structures. Viswanathan and Wang [40] and Back and Baruch [3] compare equilibrium outcomes in a market with discriminatory execution of limit orders and a market with uniform execution of limit orders (i.e., all limit orders eligible for execution execute at the execution price of the marginal share). In a model related to Glosten [20], Back and Baruch [3] identify conditions under which the equilibrium of the two markets is identical. Some authors (e.g., Baruch [4] and Boehmer

Thus, the trading mechanics of these markets can in itself explain some of the properties of limit order markets, independently of the degree of sophistication for the traders.
