In stock markets, electronic limit order books have progressively replaced floor and dealership markets. For instance, the Paris Bourse closed its floor and became a fully electronic limit order market in 1986. Bond and currency markets follow a similar evolution with the emergence of trading platforms such as EBS (FX) or E.speed and MTS (bond markets). This evolution has been a major impetus for academic research on limit order markets. This article provides a brief review of this research.</p>",

Harris and Hasbrouck [24] study the performance of actual limit orders. They find that buy (respectively sell) limit orders execute more frequently in the case of a price decline (respectively increase). Moreover, they also find that the opportunity cost of unfilled limit orders behind the best quotes is significant. Handa and Schwartz [23] use hypothetical limit and market orders. They find that the performance of filled (respectively unfilled) limit orders is higher (respectively smaller) than that of market orders. Unconditionally, the performance of each order type is identical. Overall, these findings suggest that the cost of being picked off and the cost of nonexecution are significant.</p>",

They find that traders use limit orders more frequently after a rise in transitory volatility. One possibility is that this increase in volatility reflects an increase in the bid–ask spread due to transient liquidity pressures. This increase in the bid–ask spread attracts limit order traders as providing liquidity becomes more profitable. Consistent with this interpretation, Biais <i>et al.</i> [6] find reversals in the size of bid–ask spreads after the arrival of large market orders. The speed of this reversal determines the resiliency of a limit order market to liquidity shocks and constitutes one important dimension of market liquidity. Degryse <i>et al.</i> [13] and Large [30] provide empirical analyses of the resiliency of limit order markets.</p>",

Working paper, Universitat Pompeu Fabra.), Parlour [33], Foucault <i>et al.</i> [17], Rosu [36], and Large [31] introduce dynamic models of trading in limit order markets in which execution probabilities are consistent with order submission choices in equilibrium. These models explain variation in order submission choices by variations in the state of the book and traders' valuations for the security. Traders with high valuations submit more aggressive buy orders and traders with low valuations submit more aggressive sell orders. Thus, traders with extreme valuations are more likely to submit market orders and traders with intermediate valuations are more likely to submit limit orders.</p>",

Upon arrival, buyers (respectively sellers) choose to submit a limit order at the bid (respectively ask) price or a market order. In this model, limit orders face a risk of nonexecution. In equilibrium, traders' order placement decisions depend on the state of the limit order book on <i>both</i> sides. For instance, the decision to submit a buy limit order depends on the depth on the ask side because this depth will affect future sellers' order submission choices. Moreover, the equilibrium features systematic patterns on order submissions. For instance, a sell market order is more likely after a sell market order than after a buy market order as found empirically in [6].</p>",

In this model, traders' valuations for the security are distributed around a consensus value that follows a random walk. Thus, changes in traders' valuations are positively correlated with changes in the consensus value. Consequently, buy (respectively sell) limit orders are more likely to execute when the consensus value decreases (respectively increases) than when it increases (respectively decreases). For this reason, limit orders are exposed to the risk of being picked off.

These traders submit random orders satisfying some minimal conditions (e.g., they do not violate traders' budget constraint).

Thus, the trading mechanics of these markets can in itself explain some of the properties of limit order markets, independently of the degree of sophistication for the traders.</p>",
