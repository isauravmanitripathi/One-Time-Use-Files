   In the last decade, there has been considerable interest in the commodities world, in energy, in particular, as evidenced by the number of press editorials that are being published on the subject. Commodity prices have been experiencing unprecedented moves in the last few years and there is no sign of change at the date of writing (January 2009). Demand for metals, energy, and cereals from Brazil and Russia, two of the fastest growing economies, has undoubtedly increased the volatility across all commodity classes. As an example, between 2001 and 2005, China's demand for copper, aluminum, and iron increased by 78%, 85%, and 92%, respectively.

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Energy prices, for example, those of crude oil and coal, have witnessed a very high volatilityover the last two years, under the combined effect of a greater public awareness of the exhaustible nature of fossil energy, the massive arrival of new players into commodities, and the current looming depression worldwide. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, that had undergone a respite in price increase during the year 2006, resumed in 2007 its irresistible ascent to go over the symbolic threshold of $100 per barrel in early 2008. It went above $140 per barrel in June and July, resulting in prices multiplying by more than 500% in less than four years, with—among other reasons—supply disruptions in Nigeria, a structural decline in production in Mexico and in other countries like the United Kingdom and the United States. Subsequently, crude oil prices decreased by more than $100 between July and November 2008, another move never observed previously. This "spike", unique in the history of oil markets, took place a year after the start of the subprime crisis and an explanation is difficult, at least, for the remarkable upward move. Call options on crude oil with strikes of $100 or more were the subject of great surprise when they appeared in New York in summer 2006. By May 2008, there were 21 000 outstanding contracts for the NYMEX December 2008 call options with a strike of $200 per barrel. In parallel, put options for the same maturity of December 2008 and a strike of $100 traded at $1.84 in July 2008; when they settled on November 17, 2008, crude oil prices were at $54/bbl

    Commodities and Numeraire: Some ´ Qualitative Aspects

  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Since commodities are essentially denominated in dollars, the weakness of the "numeraire" ´
   <sup>
    a
   </sup>
   currency, at least until September 2008, has often been cited as a major cause for the rise of commodity prices. Still, in constant dollars, average crude oil prices rose by 124% over the period 2002–2006; and the increase up to July 2008 was even steeper. The entire WTI crude forward curve was trading over the level of $105 with a backwardated shape in July 2008. Since the oil price more than halved the level of the forward curve changed to lower values and its shape went to a steep contango, with medium-term forward prices being higher than the first nearby price by more than $15. And in the oil market, the contango shape has essentially been associated with a situation of crisis, as during at the time of the First Gulf War or after September 11, 2001 (Figure 1).

   The same volatile market conditions across the spectrum of the three commodity classes—energy, metals, and agriculturals—are unlikely to drastically improve in the near future, with land itself becoming rare and water insufficient, disruptions occurring (like in 2008 in South African mines that represent, in particular, 80% of the world platinum production) because of electricity shortages, geopolitical issues in a number of countries producing commodities, and the world population growth. We can observe that these elements illuminate an interesting property, namely, that the three commodity subasset classes are increasingly
   <i>
    correlated
   </i>
   , a property that we can certainly view as novel in the commodity markets. Hence, energy companies like agri-food firms, bankers, and private equity funds, have all moved forward in the acquisition of new physical assets such as power plants, gas storage facilities, aluminum smelters, or grain elevators.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Looking back into the past, one should keep in mind that the history of commodities has been filled with booms, busts, seasonal volatility, weather events, geopolitical tensions, and occasional attempts to "corner" the market, features that were reasonably acting as a deterrent for new entrants. Moreover, the physical constraints of delivery and storage make spot

All market participants are increasingly aware of the fact that volatility swings reflect not only supply and demand concerns but also that these markets are sometimes dominated by large players, often opaque, and always directed by the long lead time between a production

   decision and its actual viability. Trading volumes have also fluctuated widely over time: during the high inflation era of the 1970s, commodity futures trading exploded and the real estate sector boomed since bonds and stocks were generating a real return close to zero for over a decade. The commodity boom at the end of the 1970s can be identified with the crash in 1980 of precious metals prices, when the famous squeeze of the silver market by the Hunt Brothers (who were holding at some point an estimated 50% of the global deliverable supply of silver)

  <p block-type="Text">
   failed. Afterwards there was a long period, nearly 20 years, of stagnation in commodity prices that some experts attribute to supply fundamentals and low inflation, which lasted until the early 2000s. The present effects of the worldwide recession, together with the awareness that at any time the amount of every exhaustible commodity is
   <i>
    bounded
   </i>
   , tend to pull analysts' expectations in opposite directions.

   Returning to the analysis of the numeraire effect, ´ we plotted the trajectories over the period 2000–2008 of crude oil (Figure 2), copper (Figure 3), and gold prices (Figure 4) with respect to two "currency numeraires", namely, the dollar and the euro; and ´ the CRB (Commodity Research Bureau) index, which has been perceived for a long time in the United States as a very good proxy for inflation.

   We observe that for both oil and copper, the change of numeraire has a remarkably little impact ´ on the shape of the three trajectories, indicating that major effects such as supply and demand or the massive arrival of index funds and new market participants are the ones driving the commodity price changes.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Interestingly, the same property holds in the case of gold, namely, the absence of sensitivity of the trajectory shape to the numeraire currency or index. ´ This is consistent with the fact that—for the current period at least—gold has lost its status of a special currency since its price has been falling sharply together with all commodity prices.

    From Stocks and Bonds to Commodities

  <p block-type="Text">
   Our view when turning to commodities is multifold and, in summary, is as follows:
  </p>
  <p block-type="ListGroup">
   <ul>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     1. Introducing stochastic
     <i>
      versus
     </i>
     constant interest rates when trading commodities (forwards/ futures or options) is not a big gain in precision since interest rate moves are essentially quite small compared to commodity price moves and the recent period has been more extreme than ever in this direction.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     2. This being stated, introducing stochastic interest rates is not a difficult matter since the most traded instruments in the world of commodities are the forward contracts whose prices, as mentioned before, are martingales under the "right" pricing measure, namely, the
     <i>
      T
     </i>
     -forward-adjusted probability measure. For futures contracts,c the situation is different because of the margin calls (see [8] for a discussion in the case of nonstorable commodities).
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     3. Turning now to a very different issue, which is the relevance of interest rates arbitrage models for commodities as discussed in the seminal paper [11] (
     <i>
      see also
     </i>
     <b>
      Heath–Jarrow–Morton Approach
     </b>
     ), our view is that the benefit is limited. In fact, the large literature that transposed arbitrage models of interest rates may be misguiding: default-free bonds (and even less so, interest rates) are very different from commodities. The world of commodities is characterized by possible squeezes, sudden lack of liquidity, and insufficient transparency, which make the assumption of no arbitrage (let alone market completeness and unicicity of the risk-adjusted measure
     <i>
      Q
     </i>
     ) essentially invalid [16].

   introduced in the
   <i>
    Theory of Storage

   <i>
    y
   </i>
   —net of storage costs if defined as above—translates the preference for the ownership of the physical commodity over a forward contract as well as many other effects and market frictions, hence mitigating the importance of the no-arbitrage argument.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In the case of electricity, a nonstorable commodity, the existence of a commodity yield and the spot-forward relationship collapse together [3, 10]) as evidenced, for instance, by the abrupt convergence of the forward price

    <sup>
     T
    </sup>
    (t)
   </i>
   to the spot price at date
   <i>

   even in markets like the Nordpool, where a significant fraction of electricity is hydro [5]. The same holds for agriculturals with distant maturities because of their finite lifetime.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   5. To avoid the doubtful arguments consisting in deriving the whole forward curve evolution from the spot price dynamics (
   <i>

   ), [2], also (

    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Commodity Forward Curve Modeling
   </b>
   ), when analyzing the risk management of a book of forward contracts (long or short, with different maturities), propose an original model consisting in replacing the spot price as the first state variable as in [9], by the average value
   <i>
    f (t)

     6. When turning to options on commodities, our main comments are as follows:
     <ul>
      <li block-type="ListItem" class="list-indent-1">
       a) There should be a clear consistency between the two fundamental classes of derivatives, forwards, and options, and the measure
       <i>
        Q
       </i>
       (assuming its unicicity) has to be derived from the forward curve where the liquidity is located.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li block-type="ListItem" class="list-indent-1">
       b) Most financial options sold in the commodity world are backed by the physical optionalities attached to the ownership of physical assets such as a gas storage facility or a gas-fired power plant [5]. Hence, the valuation of these options is not tied to a particular model (a desirable feature after the catastrophic meltdown of the credit risk market), but rather to the "real" value of the externalized optionality.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li block-type="ListItem" class="list-indent-1">
       c) Because of property b, many financial options on commodities are options to exchange a commodity S1 for a commodity S2 (for instance, crude oil for kerosene) or spread options. The natural numeraire ´ is then S1 and the relevant underlying the relative price S2/S1, outside any assumption on interest rates. Note that Margrabe [14] (
       <i>
        see
       </i>
       <b>
        Margrabe Formula
       </b>
       ) used the numeraire terminology in his remarkable ´ paper, without introducing the associated change of measure; the latter would have made unnecessary the assumption of constant interest rates, as shown in [6].
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     7. Lastly, a worthwhile observation relative to the subject of commodities and numeraire is the fol- ´ lowing: let us consider the situation of a position held by an energy company based, for instance, in the United Kingdom, whose equity and profits are denominated in sterling pounds. Its portfolio typically contains crude oil, natural gas, electricity, coal, physical assets, and spot and derivatives contracts with counterparties based
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   in the United Kingdom, Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. In order to avoid, in a first stage, an array of currency risk, (Norwegian krone, Euro,
   <i>
    etc.
   </i>
   ) and minimize the cost of risk management while exploiting the correlations between the various commodities when denominated in a single currency (US dollar for instance), one may decide to use the price
   <i>
    X
   </i>
   of a barrel of Brent crude oil, dollar-denominated, as the numeraire. ´ Using affine relationships (e.g., indexation of natural gas to crude oil in Germany and other countries of continental Europe), correlations or co-integrations between the various energy commodity prices, the portfolio will be risk managed over time in terms of long and short positions with respect to crude oil. In the second stage, the "missing" components (orthogonal to crude oil) in the various other energy commodities will be accounted for; and in the third stage, the different currencies will be incorporated in the picture.

    Conclusion
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In a mature Walrasian economy [17], the general equilibrium output is enhanced by the optimal selection of the components of a multicommodity numeraire, according to the decisions of borrowers ´ and lenders. The commodity evaluations that then emerge from transactions are accomplished by requiring that money in circulation be representative of this numeraire. This multicommodity num ´ eraire is ´ welfare optimal and should then constitute the real reserves of the monetary system.

   The numeraire is the money unit of measure within an ´ abstract economic model in which there is not necessarily actual money or currency. From a mathematical standpoint, it is a stochastic process,
