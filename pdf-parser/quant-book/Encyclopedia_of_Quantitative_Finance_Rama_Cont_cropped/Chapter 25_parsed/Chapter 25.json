He attended the Lakeside School in Seattle and graduated in 1962 as one of the two graduation speakers. He earned an A.B. in Economics, magna cum laude, from Harvard College in 1966 and an MBA with a concentration in finance from the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University in 1968. In 1971, Rubinstein earned his PhD. in Finance from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). During this time at UCLA, he was heavily influenced by the microeconomist Jack Hirshleifer. In July 1972, he became an assistant professor in finance at the University of Californian at Berkeley, where he remained for his entire career. He was advanced to tenure unusually early in 1976 and became a full professor in 1980.</p>",

Specifically, between 1971 and 1973, his research centered on the mean–variance capital asset pricing model and came to include skewness as a measure of risk [3–5]. Rubinstein's extension has new relevance as several researchers have since determined its predictive power in explaining realized security returns. In 1974, Rubinstein's research turned to more general models of asset pricing. He developed an extensive example of multiperiod security market equilibrium, which later became the dominant model used by academics in their theoretical papers on asset pricing. Unlike earlier work, he left the intertemporal process of security returns to be determined in equilibrium rather than as datum (although as special cases he assumed a random walk and constant interest rates). Rubinstein was thus able to derive conditions for the existence of a random walk and an unbiased term structure of interest rates. He also was the first to derive a simple equation in equilibrium for valuing a risky stream of income received over time. He published the first paper to show explicitly how and why in equilibrium investors would want to hold long-term bonds in their portfolios, and in particular would want to hold a riskless (in terms of income) annuity maturing at their death, foreshadowing several strands of later research.</p>",

At the time, the novel idea of portfolio insurance had been put forth by Leland, later fully developed together with Rubinstein, and successfully marketed among large institutional investors by O'Brien. Their business grew extremely rapidly, only to be cut short when they had to share the blame for the October 1987 stock market crash. Not admitting defeat, LOR invented another product that became the first exchange-traded fund (ETF), the SuperTrust, listed on the American Stock Exchange in 1992.

The article included new techniques for inferring risk-neutral probability distributions from options on the same underlying asset. Rubinstein's revisions of the model provide the natural generalization of the standard binomial model to accommodate arbitrary expiration date risk-neutral probability distributions. This paper, in turn, spurred new academic work on option pricing in the latter half of the 1990s and found immediate application among various professionals. In 1998 and 1999, Rubinstein rounded out his work on derivatives by publishing a second text titled \"Rubinstein on Derivatives,\" which expanded its domain from calls and puts to futures and more general types of derivatives. The book also pioneered new ways to integrate computers as an aid to learning.</p>",

No other book has so far been written that comes close to examining in detail the intellectual path that has led to modern financial economics (particularly, in the subarea of investments). Rubinstein shows that the discovery of key ideas in finance is much more complex and multistaged than anyone had realized. Too few are given too much credit, and sometimes original work has been forgotten.</p>",
