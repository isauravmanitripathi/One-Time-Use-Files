They were introduced in part to replicate certain portfolio strategies and in part to extend single-name options to portfolios. What these options share is a strong dependence on the correlation structure of the assets, brought about by their nonlinear and pathdependent payoffs. But beyond this similarity, each type has its own distinct payoff tailored to its own risk profile and use, making each deserving of its own study. In this last of three articles on Mountain Range options, we look at the Altiplano option, which can be thought of as an extension of barrier options to baskets.</p>",

Owing to their complex payoff and path-dependency, idiosyncratic characteristics of each asset need to be taken into account. Hence one cannot assume homogeneity of assets for either small or large baskets, making any closed-form approximation (especially in light of path dependence) intractable. As a result, Mountain Range options, specially the path-dependent varieties such as the Altiplano, are calculated using Monte Carlo simulation [1]. Monte Carlo methods, especially for high-dimensional payoffs with large number of assets and time points, are slow to converge, and usually one or more variancereduction techniques are employed. Additionally, since the barrier event is binary, the number of simulation paths needed is even greater than those with</p>",

Even in the simple lognormal model, the sheer size of the correlation matrix can become a challenge. Since for <i>n</i> assets, there can be <i>n(n</i> − 1<i>)/</i>2 distinct correlations, even for a modest basket of 10 assets, 45 distinct correlations are possible. Moreover, it is not clear how one can obtain the pairwise correlations themselves. If, theoretically speaking, there existed <i>n(n</i> − 1<i>)/</i>2 traded spread options on each pair, their implied correlations could be used with the spread options as hedges. However, it is unlikely that every pair of assets in a basket would have a traded spread option. Even if they did, their sheer number would make transaction costs prohibitive, even for moderate bid–ask spreads. Hence historical correlations are more often used, even though as with all historical estimates, they are hard to hedge and can change with macro- and microeconomic shifts. When all assets belong to the same sector, a single correlation number is commonly used. This high amount of asset interdependence makes cross-gammas important, adding further to the hedging complexity.</p>",

Again, for ease of analysis, we look at a homogeneous portfolio with identical pairwise correlations given by a single number in the simple lognormal model with no coupon payout. For a simple call option on a basket, it is known that high correlation and volatility increase its price. For the barrier event, it depends on the type. If it takes only one asset to hit a barrier, then low correlation and high volatility increase the probability of hitting it. Moreover, depending on the barrier, the paths that lead to higher option prices may make the barrier even more or less likely, leading to possible nonmonotonous behavior.
