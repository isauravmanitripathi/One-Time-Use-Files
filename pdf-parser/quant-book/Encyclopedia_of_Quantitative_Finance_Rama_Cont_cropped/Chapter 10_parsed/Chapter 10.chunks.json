Responding to the appearance of the \"Black Ships\" in Yokohama harbor and Commodore Perry's demand that they open their doors, the Japanese overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate and in 1868 \"restored\" the emperor Meiji to power. The Meiji Restoration initiated a period of rapid change during which Japan made a concerted and remarkably successful effort to transform itself from an isolated, feudal society into a modern state that was ready to play a major role in the world.</p>",

Thus, Itô and his peers were expected to choose a topic that they would first teach themselves and then teach their compatriots.

In view of the circumstances, it is not surprising that few inside Japan, and nobody outside of Japan, knew what Itô was doing for nearly a decade. Itô did publish an outline of his program in a journal of mimeographed notes (1942) at Osaka University, but he says that only his friend G. Maruyama really read what he had written. Thus, it was not until 1950, when he sent the manuscript for a monograph to Doob who arranged that it be published by the A.M.S. as a Memoir, that Itô's work began to receive the attention which it deserved. Full appreciation of Itô's ideas by the mathematical community came only after first Doob and then H.P. McKean applied martingale theory to greatly simplify some of Itô's more technical arguments.</p>",

He is, in large part, responsible for the position of Japan as a major force in probability theory, and he has disciples all over the planet. His accomplishments are widely recognized: he is a member of the Japanese Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences; and he is the recipient of, among others, the Kyoto, Wolf, and Gauss Prizes. When I think of Itô's career and the rocky road that he had to travel, I recall what Jack Schwartz told a topology class I was attending about Jean Leray's invention of spectral sequences.
