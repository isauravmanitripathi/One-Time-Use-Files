   Itô, Kiyosi (1915–2008)
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Kiyosi Itô was born in 1915, approximately 60 years after the Meiji Restoration. Responding to the appearance of the "Black Ships" in Yokohama harbor and Commodore Perry's demand that they open their doors, the Japanese overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate and in 1868 "restored" the emperor Meiji to power. The Meiji Restoration initiated a period of rapid change during which Japan made a concerted and remarkably successful effort to transform itself from an isolated, feudal society into a modern state that was ready to play a major role in the world.

  <p block-type="Text">
   During the first phase of this period, they sent their best and brightest abroad to acquire and bring back to Japan the ideas and techniques that had been previously blocked entry by the shogunate's closed door policy. However, by 1935, the year that Itô entered Tokyo University, the Japanese transformation process had already moved to a second phase, one in which the best and brightest were kept at home to study, assimilate, and eventually disseminate the vast store of information which had been imported during the first phase. Thus, Itô and his peers were expected to choose a topic that they would first teach themselves and then teach their compatriots. For those of us who had the benefit of step-by-step guidance from knowledgeable teachers, it is difficult to imagine how Itô and his fellow students managed, and we can only marvel at the fact that they did.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The topic which Itô chose was that of stochastic processes. At the time, the field of stochastic processes had only recently emerged and was still in its infancy. N. Wiener (1923) had constructed Brownian motion, A.N. Kolmogorov (1933) and Wm. Feller (1936) had laid the analytic foundations on which the theory of diffusions would be built, and P. Lévy (1937) had given a pathspace interpretation of infinitely divisible laws. However, in comparison to well-established fields such as complex analysis, stochastic processes still looked more like a haphazard collection of examples than a unified field.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Having studied mechanics, Itô from the outset was drawn to Lévy's pathspace perspective with its emphasis on paths and dynamics, and he set as his goal the reconciliation of Kolmogorov and Feller's analytic treatment with Lévy's pathspace picture. To carry out his program, he first had to thoroughly
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   understand Lévy, and, as anyone who has attempted to read Lévy in the original knows, this in itself a daunting task. Indeed, I have my doubts that, even now, many of us would know what Lévy did had Itô not explained it to us. Be that as it may, Itô's first published paper (1941) was devoted to a reworking (incorporating important ideas due to J.L. Doob) of Lévy's theory of homogeneous, independent increment processes.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Undoubtedly as a dividend of the time and effort which he spent unraveling Lévy's ideas, shortly after completing this paper Itô had a wonderful insight of his own. To explain his insight, imagine that the space
   <math display="inline">
    M_1(\mathbb{R})
   </math>
   of probability measures on
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{R}
   </math>
   has a differentiable structure in which the underlying dynamics is given by convolution. Then, if
   <math display="inline">
    t \in
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    [0,\infty) \longmapsto \mu_t \in M_1(\mathbb{R})
   </math>
   is a "smooth curve" which starts at the unit point mass
   <math display="inline">
    \delta_0
   </math>
   , its "tangent" at time 0, it should be given by the limit
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\mu_{\frac{1}{n}}\right)^{\star}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    \star
   </math>
   denotes convolution and therefore
   <math display="inline">
    \nu^{\star n}
   </math>
   is the
   <i>
    n
   </i>
   -fold convolution power of
   <math display="inline">
    \nu \in M_1(\mathbb{R})
   </math>
   . What Itô realized is that, if this limit exists, it must be an infinitely divisible law. Applied to
   <math display="inline">
    \mu_t = P(t, x, \cdot)
   </math>
   , where
   <math display="inline">
    (t, x) \in [0, \infty) \times \mathbb{R} \longmapsto
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    P(t, x, \cdot) \in M_1(\mathbb{R})
   </math>
   is the transition probability function for a Markov process, this key observation lead Itô to view Kolmogorov's forward equation as describing the flow of a vector field on
   <math display="inline">
    M_1(\mathbb{R}).
   </math>
   In addition, because infinitely divisible laws play in the geometry of
   <math display="inline">
    M_1(\mathbb{R})
   </math>
   the role&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; that straight lines play in Euclidean space, he saw that one should be able to "integrate" Kolmogorov's equation by piecing together infinitely divisible laws, just as one integrates a vector field in Euclidean space by piecing together straight lines.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Profound as the preceding idea is, Itô went a step further. Again under Lévy's influence, he wanted to transfer his idea to a pathspace setting. Reasoning that if the transition function can be obtained by concatenating infinitely divisible laws, then the paths of the associated stochastic processes must be obtainable to concatenating paths coming from Lévy's independent increment processes and that one should be able to encode this concatenation procedure in some sort of "differential equation" for the resulting paths. The implementation of this program required him to develop what is now called the "Itô calculus".
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   It was during the period when he was working out the details of his calculus that he realized, at least in the special case when paths are continuous, there is a formula which plays role in his calculus that the chain rule plays in Newton's. This formula, which appeared for the first time in a footnote, is what we now call Itô's formula. Humble as its origins may have been, it has become one of the three or four most famous mathematics formulae of the twentieth century. Itô's formula is not only a boon of unquestioned and inestimable value to mathematicians but also has become an indispensable tool in the world of mathematically oriented finance.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Itô had these ideas in the early 1940s, around the time when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and its population had to face the consequent horrors. In view of the circumstances, it is not surprising that few inside Japan, and nobody outside of Japan, knew what Itô was doing for nearly a decade. Itô did publish an outline of his program in a journal of mimeographed notes (1942) at Osaka University, but he says that only his friend G. Maruyama really read what he had written. Thus, it was not until 1950, when he sent the manuscript for a monograph to Doob who arranged that it be published by the A.M.S. as a Memoir, that Itô's work began to receive the attention which it deserved. Full appreciation of Itô's ideas by the mathematical community came only after first Doob and then H.P. McKean applied martingale theory to greatly simplify some of Itô's more technical arguments.

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Despite its less than auspicious beginning, the story has a happy ending. Itô spent many years traveling the world: he has three daughters, one living in Japan, one in Denmark, and one in America. He is, in large part, responsible for the position of Japan as a major force in probability theory, and he has disciples all over the planet. His accomplishments are widely recognized: he is a member of the Japanese Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences; and he is the recipient of, among others, the Kyoto, Wolf, and Gauss Prizes. When I think of Itô's career and the rocky road that he had to travel, I recall what Jack Schwartz told a topology class I was attending about Jean Leray's invention of spectral sequences. At the time, Leray was a prisoner
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   in a German prison camp for French intellectuals, each of whom attempted to explain to the others something about which he was thinking. With the objective of not discussing anything that might be useful to the enemy, Leray chose to talk about algebraic topology rather than his own work on partial differential equations, and for this purpose, he introduced spectral sequences as a pedagogic tool. After relating this anecdote, Schwartz leaned back against the blackboard and spent several minutes musing about the advantages of doing research in ideal working conditions.

   Kiyosi Itô died at the age of 93 on November 10, 2008. He is survived by his three daughters. A week before his death, he received the Cultural Medal from the Japanese emperor. The end of an era is fast approaching.
