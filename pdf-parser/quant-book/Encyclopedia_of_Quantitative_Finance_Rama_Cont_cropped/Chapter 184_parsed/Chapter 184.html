    Constant Maturity Credit Default Swap
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A constant maturity credit default swap (CM CDS) is a credit derivative with payments linked to periodic fixings of a standard CDS rate with a fixed tenor (e.g., 5 years) on a particular credit entity. In business practice, CM CDS is usually presented as an elaboration of a plain CDS suitable for use in trading strategies expressing certain views on the steepening or flattening of credit spreads. From the point of view of quantitative modeling, CM CDS is best understood as a simple representative of a family of structured credit exotics, more complicated members of which would depend on a nonlinear combination of CDS spreads of more than one maturity and/or refer to more than one credit entity. Both business practice and quantitative modeling of CM CDS are based on ideas and techniques originally developed for CMS-linked fixed income exotics and adapted to credit modeling.

  <h2>
   Instrument Structure
  </h2>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   A CM CDS trade usually consists of two legs, one of which is a CM CDS leg, which is a sequence of payments
   <math display="inline">
    P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n
   </math>
   made on a schedule of payment dates
   <math display="inline">
    T_1', T_2', \ldots T_n'
   </math>
   (which is typically set following conventions of a standard CDS schedule) and is computed by the following formula:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    P_i = \Delta_i \min[C, a \cdot S(T_i, T_{i+M})] \tag{1}

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Here
   <math display="inline">
    S(T_i, T_{i+M})
   </math>
   is the rate of a CDS spanning

    M
   </math>
   payment periods and observed at the fixing date
   <math display="inline">
    T_i

   <math display="inline">
    \Delta_i

   is the fixed rate reset cap.&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; Notional amount of the trade is set to 1. The fixing normally happens at the beginning of the accrual period, so that
   <math display="inline">
    T'_{i} = T_{i+1}^{b}
   </math>
   . In the case of a default of the reference credit, the fraction of the last payment accrued before the default is paid and further payments stop.

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The second leg of a CM CDS is normally a standard CDS protection leg; however, structures where the second leg is either a standard CDS premium leg or another CM CDS leg corresponding
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   to a different tenor are also possible. The quote for a CM CDS is usually given in terms of the participation rate,
   <math display="inline">
    a
   </math>
   , of the CM CDS leg. With the second leg being the standard CDS protection leg, a participation rate of less than 100% reflects the expectation of rising credit spreads, whereas a participation rate of more than
   <math display="inline">
    100\%
   </math>
   corresponds to the expectation of decreasing credit spreads.

    Trading Aspects
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Descriptions of CM CDS structures started circulating in research communications of securities firms in early 2004, [3, 5, 6]. On November 21, 2005, ISDA provided a publication [4] setting a standard for the terms and condition of the CM CDS leg, including a mechanism for the determination of CDS rate resets. Establishing undisputable resets for CDS rates presents a problem because no standard source of information on CDS rates similar to Telerate pages of interest rates has emerged.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The primary mechanism stipulated by ISDA compels the seller of protection in a CM CDS to make a binding bid for the fixed rate premium that the seller is willing to pay in exchange for protection in a standard CDS on the same credit entity. This bid will be used as a CDS rate reset and is expected to be a good proxy for the true CDS rate because the seller has no incentive to quote a value that is too high (in which case the seller can be forced to buy overpriced CDS protection) or too low (in which case the seller will lose on the coming CM CDS payment). A fallback mechanism, which comes into effect if the receiver fails to provide a bid, puts on the buyer the burden of obtaining CDS quotes from a set of fallback dealers, subsequently using the highest quote as the rate reset.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   At the time of this study, the volume of CM CDS transactions remains limited, taming optimistic predictions for the development of multilayered structures, such as tranches of CM CDS portfolios, but not destroying such prospects completely. We also note that more exotic structures with payoffs linked to nonlinear combinations of CDS rates of different maturities were observed in the market and have potential for further growth.

Indeed, even apart from the obvious problem of not handling the cap condition, the expectation
   <math display="inline">

   Convexity Adjustments

   In this section a discussion on volatility-dependent corrections to the results obtained in the nonstochastic approximation is provided. Such correction can be either derived from a fully consistent model capable of computing

   ensures that the calculation of the average (9) for
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma = 0
   </math>
   brings us back to the nonstochastic valuation. A nonzero volatility
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma &gt; 0
   </math>
   leads to a positive correction due to the convexity of the product
   <math display="inline">
    g(S)f(S)
   </math>
   in the region of values of S close to
   <math display="inline">
    F(T_i, T_{i+M})
   </math>
   and distant from the
   <math display="inline">
    \text{cap } C
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   This approach has an advantage of relative simplicity and potential ability of calibrating the model volatility
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma
   </math>
   to CDS options. The disadvantage is an uncontrollable assumption in the choice of the function
   <math display="inline">
    g(S)
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <h4>
   Instantaneous Hazard Rate Modeling
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A more systematic modeling of CM CDS is possible in the framework of stochastic instantaneous hazard rates. This approach starts with postulating a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the stochastic default intensity
   <math display="inline">
    \lambda(t)
   </math>
   . A reasonable choice is a lognormal process (similar to the Black-Karasinski model of interest rates) or an affine process (similar to the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model of interest rates). A normal process (similar to the Hull–White model of interest rates) was also used despite a conceptual problem posed by positive probabilities of negative hazard rates. Multifactor models for joint stochastic evolution of hazard rates and instantaneous interest rates are also possible.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An exact analytical solution for a CM CDS is not available in any of these models because of a two-layered structure involving inner expectations for CDS rates fixings conditional on the state achieved on the fixing dates. The machinery of trees, lattices, or partial differential equation (PDE) solvers, however, can be accommodated to handle CM CDS structures. The key element is a construction of a slice of values of CM CDS rate fixings on the set of model states achieved on the fixing date. This is done using a representation of the CDS rate in terms of conditional expectations of elementary instruments
   <math display="inline">
    B_t(T)
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    H_t(T_1, T_2)
   </math>
   provided by equations (7), (6), and (8). We refer to Chapter 7 of the book [7] for the details of a possible realization of a tree-based construction.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An advantage of hazard rate modeling is its consistency that allows to price a wide range of credit instruments of different maturities, including CDS options, asset swaps, bond options, and credit linked notes using the same model. A notable disadvantage is the difficulty of calibration.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Forward Credit Spread Modeling
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As drawbacks of short-rate models of interest rates led to the invention and development of swap and LIBOR market models, similar progression is taking place in the space of structured credit models. We refer to the work [1] and Chapter 23 of [2] for details of a model in which the CDS rates
   <math display="inline">
    S_t(T_i, T_{i+M})
   </math>
   are chosen as primary variables.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   An advantage of this approach is the ease of calibration and ability to derive efficient analytical
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   approximations under minimal additional assumptions. At present, the disadvantage is the paucity of relevant market data, leaving a large freedom in specifying the structure of volatilities and correlations. A full payback from this level of model sophistication cannot be expected until the market for structured products develops enough to provide liquid quotes for CDS option volatilities for a dense set of maturities, similarly to caplet and swaption volatility matrices in the interest rate markets.
