In theoretical pricing of derivative securities, an arbitrage is a riskless trading strategy that generates a positive profit with no net investment of funds. This definition can be loosened to allow the positive profit to be nonnegative, with no possible future state having a negative outcome and at least one state with a positive outcome. Pricing formulas for specific contingent claims are derived by assuming an absence of arbitrage opportunities. Generalizing this notion of arbitrage, the fundamental theorem of asset pricing provides that an absence of arbitrage opportunities implies the existence of an equivalent martingale measure (<i>see</i> <b>Fundamental Theorem of</b> <b>Asset Pricing</b>; <b>Equivalent Martingale Measures</b>). Combining absence of arbitrage with a linear model of asset returns, the arbitrage pricing theory decomposes the expected return of a financial asset into a linear function of various economic risk factors, including market indices. Sensitivity of expected return to changes in each factor is represented by a factor-specific beta coefficient. Significantly, while riskless arbitrage imposes restrictions on prices observed at a given point in time, the arbitrage pricing theory seeks to explain expected returns, which involve prices observed at different points in time.</p>",

Similarly, uncovered interest arbitrage seeks to exploit differences between foreign and domestic interest rates leaving the risk of currency fluctuations unhedged.

Available evidence is primarily from the Middle East and suggests that mercantile trade in ancient markets was extensive and provided a number of avenues for risky arbitrage. Potential opportunities were tempered by the lack of liquidity in markets; the difficulties of obtaining information and moving goods over distances; and, inherent political and economic risks. Trading institutions and available securities were relatively simple. Circa 1760 BC, the Code of Hammurabi dealt extensively with matters of trade and finance. Sumerian cuneiform tablets from that era indicate a rudimentary form of bill of exchange transaction was in use where a payment (disbursement) would be made in one location in the local unit of account, for example, barley, in exchange for disbursement (payment) at a later date in another location of an agreed upon amount of that local currency, for example, lead [6]. The date was typically determined by the accepted transport time between the locations. Two weeks to a month was a commonly observed time between the payment and repayment. The specific payment location was often a temple.</p>",

For example, during the era of the Athenian empire (480–404 BC), Persia maintained a bimetallic coinage system where silver was undervalued relative to gold. The resulting export of silver coins from Persia to Greece and elsewhere in the Mediterranean is an early instance of a type of arbitrage activity that became a mainstay of the arbitrageur in later years. This type of arbitrage trading was confined to money changers with the special skills and tools to measure the bullion value of coins. In addition to the costs and risks of transportation, the arbitrage was restricted by the seigniorage and minting charges levied in the different political jurisdictions. Because coinage was exchanged by weight and trading by bills of exchange was rudimentary, there were no arbitrageurs specializing solely in \"arbitrating of exchange rates\". Rather, arbitrage opportunities arose from the trading activities of networks of merchants and money changers. These opportunities included uncovered interest arbitrage between areas with low interest rates, such as Jewish Palestine, and those with high rates, such as Babylonia [6, p.18–19].</p>",

On the third day of each fair, a representative body composed of recognized merchant bankers would assemble and determine the exchange rates that would prevail for that fair. The process involved each banker suggesting an exchange rate and, after some discussion, a voting process would determine the exchange rates that would apply at that fair. Similar practices were adopted at other important fairs later in the Middle Ages. At Lyon, for example, Florentine, Genoese, and Lucca bankers would meet separately to determine rates, with the average of these group rates becoming the official rate. These rates would then apply to bill transactions and other business conducted at the fair. Rates typically stayed constant between fairs in a particular location providing the opportunity for arbitraging of exchange rates across fairs in different locations.</p>",

The issued bill of exchange is drawn on a correspondent or agent of the taker who is situated abroad. The correspondent, the \"payer\", is required to pay a stated amount of foreign cash money to the \"payee\", to whom the bill is made payable.

Exchange rates determined for a given fair would have to be roughly consistent with triangular arbitrage to avoid Church sanctions. In addition, the Church usury prohibition impacted the payment of interest on money loans. Because foreign exchange transactions were licit under canon law, it was possible to disguise the payment of interest in a combination of bill of exchange transactions referred to as <i>dry exchange</i> or <i>fictitious exchange</i> [13, p.380–381], [17, 26]. The associated exchange and re-exchange of bills was a risky set of transactions that could be covertly used to invest money balances or to borrow funds to finance the contractual obligations. The expansion of bill trading for financial purposes combined with the variation in the exchange rates obtained at fairs in different locations provided the opportunity of geographical arbitrage of exchange rates using bills of exchange. It was this financial practice of exploiting differences in bill exchange rates between financial centers that evolved into the \"arbitration of exchange\" identified by la Porte [22], Savary [24], and Postelwayte [30] in the eighteenth century.</p>",

Reflecting the importance of the activity to ordinary merchants in the Middle Ages, methods of determining the bullion content of coins from assay results, and rates of exchange between coins once bullion content had been determined, formed a substantial part of important commercial arithmetics, such as the <i>Triparty</i> (1484) of Nicolas Chuquet [2]. The complications involved in trading without a standardized unit of account were imposing. There were a sizable number of political jurisdictions that minted coins, each with distinct characteristics and weights [14]. Different metals and combinations of metals were used to mint coinage. The value of silver coins, the type of coins most commonly used for ordinary transactions, was constantly changing because of debasement and \"clipping\". Over time, significant changes in the relative supply of gold and silver, especially due to inflows from the New World, altered the relative values of bullion. As a result, merchants in a particular political jurisdiction were reluctant to accept foreign coinage at the par value set by the originating jurisdiction. It was common practice for foreign coinage to be assayed and a value set by the mint conducting the assay. Over time, this led to considerable market pressures to develop a unit of account that would alleviate the expensive and time-consuming practice of determining coinage value.</p>",

Holland first issued a ducat in 1487 and, as a consequence of the global trading power of Holland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the ducat became the primary trade coin for the world. Unlike similar coins such as the florin and guinea, the ducat specifications of about 3.5 g of 0.986 gold did not change over time. The use of mint parities for specific coins and market prices for others did result in the gold–silver exchange ratio differing across jurisdictions. For example, in 1688, the Amsterdam gold–silver ratio for the silver rixdollar mint price and gold ducat market price was 14.93 and, in London, the mint price ratio was 15.58 for the silver shilling and gold guinea [25, p.475]. Given transport and other costs of moving bullion, such gold/silver price ratio differences were not usually sufficient to generate significant bullion flows. However, combined in trading with bills of exchange, substantial bullion flows did occur from arbitrage trading.</p>",

The arbitrage illustrates how the markets for gold, silver, and bills of exchange interacted. At that time, silver was the primary monetary metal used for transactions though gold coins were available. Prior to 1663, when the English Mint introduced milling of coins with serrated edges to prevent clipping, all English coins were \"hammered\" [20]. The minting technology of hammering coins was little changed from Roman times. The process produced imperfect coins, not milled at the edges, which were only approximately equal in size, weight, and imprint making altered coins difficult to identify [29, ch.4]. Such coins were susceptible to clipping, resulting in circulating silver coins that were usually under the nominal Mint weight. Despite a number of legislative attempts at remedying the situation, around 1686, the bulk of the circulating coins in England were still hammered silver. The Mint would buy silver and gold by weight in exchange for milled silver shilling coins at a set price per ounce. When the market price of silver rose sufficiently above the mint price, English goldsmiths would melt the milled silver coin issued by the Mint, though it was technically illegal to do so.</p>",

These costs would be mitigated significantly for a London firm also operating in the bill and bullion market of Amsterdam, as was the case with a number of London goldsmiths. The strength of the pound sterling in the bill market from 1685–1688 generated gold inflows to England from this trade higher than any other four-year period in the seventeenth century [25, p.478]. The subsequent weakening of the pound in the bill market from 1689 until the great recoinage in 1696 led to arbitrage trades switching from producing gold inflows to substantial outflows of silver from melted coins and clipping.</p>",

For example, if sterling bills on London were cheaper in Paris than in Bruges, then medieval bankers would profit by selling sterling in Bruges and buying in Paris. The effect of such transactions was to keep all exchange rates roughly in parity with the triangular arbitrage condition. Temporary discrepancies did occur but such trading provided a mechanism of adjustment. The arbitrages were risky even when done entirely with bills of exchange. Owing to the slowness of communications, market conditions could change before bills of exchange reached their destination and the re-exchange could be completed. As late as the sixteenth century, only the Italian merchant bankers, the Fuggers of Augsburg, and a few other houses with correspondents in all banking centers were able to engage actively in arbitrage [28, p.137]. It is not until the eighteenth century that markets for bills were sufficiently developed to permit arbitration of exchange to become standard practice of merchants deciding on the most profitable method of remitting or drawing funds offshore.</p>",

In the example above, the purchase of a bill in Paris would require funds, which are generated by the bill sale in Bruges. The profits are realized in London. Merchant bankers would be able to temporarily mitigate the associated geographical fund imbalances with internally generated capital, but re-exchanges or movements of bullion were necessary if imbalances persisted. To be consistent with the spirit of the self-financing element of modern riskless arbitrage, the example of medieval banker arbitrage among Paris, Bruges, and London can be extended to two issuing locations and two payment centers. It is possible for the same location to be used as both the issuing and payment location but that will not be assumed. Let the two issuing locations be, say, Antwerp and Hamburg, with the two payment locations being London and Venice. The basic strategy involves making offsetting bill transactions in the two issuing locations</p>",

From a relatively brief treatment in early seventeenth century sources, for example, [13], merchants' manuals detailing technical aspects of bill trading were available by the beginning of the eighteenth century. The English work by Justice, <math display=\"inline\">A</math>General Treatise on Money and Exchanges [9], an expanded translation of an earlier treatise in French by M. Ricard, details the workings of bill transactions, recognizing subtle characteristics in the bill contract. However, as a reflection of the rudimentary state of the English bill market in the early eighteenth century, Justice did not approve of \"drawing bills upon one country payable in another\" due to the \"difference in the Laws of Exchange, in different countries\" giving rise to \"a great many inconveniences\" [9, p.28]. As the eighteenth century progressed, there was substantial growth in the breadth and depth of the bill market supported by increases in speed of communication between key financial centers with London emerging as the focal point [16, 31]. This progress was reflected in the increasingly sophisticated treatment of arbitration of exchange in merchants' manuals</p>",

In some sources, self-financing arbitrage opportunities created by combining remitting and drawing opportunities are identified. Discussions of the practice invariably involve calculations of the \"arbitrated rates\". Earlier manuals such as the one by Le Moine [11] only provide a few basic calculations aimed to illustrate the transactions involved. The expanded treatment in Postlewayt [24] provides a number of worked calculations. In one example, exchange rates at London are given as London-Paris 31 3/4 pence sterling for 1 French crown: London-Amsterdam as 240 pence sterling for 414 groats. Worked calculations are given for the problem \"What is the proportional arbitrated price between Amsterdam and Paris?\" Considerable effort is given to show the arithmetic involved in determining this arbitrated rate as 54 123/160 groat for 1 crown. Using this calculated arbitrated exchange rate and the already known actual London-Paris rate, Postlewayt then proceeds to determine the arbitrated rate for London-Amsterdam using these exchange rates for Paris-London and Paris-Amsterdam finding that it equals 240 pence sterling for 414 groats.</p>",

For example, when the arbitrated Amsterdam-Paris rate is above the actual rate, calculations are provided to demonstrate that drawing sterling in London by selling a bill on Paris, using the funds to buy a bill on Amsterdam and then exchanging the guilders/groats received in Amsterdam at the actual rate to cover the crown liability in Paris will produce a self-financing arbitrage profit. Similarly, when the arbitrated Amsterdam–Paris rate is below the actual rate, the trades in the arbitrage involve drawing sterling in London by selling a bill on Amsterdam, using the funds to buy a bill on Paris and then exchanging at the actual Amsterdam-Paris exchange rate the crowns received in Paris to cover the guilder liability. This is similar to the risky medieval banker arbitrage where the rate on re-exchange is uncertain. Though the actual rate is assumed to be known, in practice, this rate could change over the time period it takes to settle the relevant bill transactions. However, the degree of risk</p>",

By the nineteenth century, merchants' manuals such as [34] accurately described the range of adjustments required for the actual execution of the trades. Taking the perspective of a London merchant with sterling seeking to create a fund of francs in Paris, a difference is recognized between two methods of determining the direct rate of exchange: buying a bill in the London market for payment in Paris; or having correspondents in Paris issue for francs a bill for sterling payment in London. In comparing with the arbitrated rates, the more advantageous direct rate is used. In determining direct rates, 3-month bill exchange rates are used even though the trade is of shorter duration. These rates are then adjusted to \"short\" rates to account for the interest factor. Arbitrated rates are calculated and, in comparing with direct rates, an additional brokerage charge (plus postage) is deducted from the indirect trade due to the extra transaction involved, for example, a London merchant buys a bill for payment in Frankfurt, which is then sold in Paris. No commissions are charged as it is assumed that the trade is done \"between branches of the same house, or on joint account\" [34, p.98].</p>",

In addition to various government bond issues, available securities liquid enough for arbitrage trading included numerous railway securities that appeared around the middle of the century. For example, both Haupt [8] and Cohn [3] specifically identify over a dozen securities traded in Amsterdam that were sufficiently liquid to be available for arbitrage with London. Included on both lists are securities as diverse as the Illinois and Erie Railway shares and the Austrian government silver loan. Securities of mines and banks increased in importance as the century progressed. The expansion in railway securities, particularly during the US consolidations of the 1860s, led to the introduction of traded contingencies associated with these securities such as rights issues, warrant options, and convertible securities. Weinstein [33] identifies this development as the beginning of arbitrage in equivalent securities, which, in modern times, encompasses convertible bond arbitrage and municipal bond arbitrage. However, early eighteenth century English and French subscription shares do have a similar claim [32].

Securities and contracts with contingencies have a history stretching to ancient times when trading was often done using samples and merchandise contracts had to allow for time to delivery and the possibility that the sample was not representative of the delivered goods. Such contingencies were embedded in merchandise contracts and were not suited to arbitrage trading. The securitization of such contingencies into forward contracts that are adaptable to cash-and-carry arbitrage trading can be traced to the introduction of \"to arrive\" contracts on the Antwerp bourse during the sixteenth century [19, ch.9]. Options trading was a natural development on the trade in time bargains, where buyers could either take delivery or could pay a fixed fee in lieu of delivery. In effect, such forward contracts were bundled with an option contract having the premium paid at delivery.</p>",

Available sources on such trades conducted in Amsterdam, Joseph de la Vega [21, ch.3] and Isaac da Pinto [19, p.366–377] were written by observers who were not the actual traders, so only crude details of the arbitrage trades are provided. Conversion arbitrages for put and call options, which involves knowledge of put–call parity, are described by both de la Vega and da Pinto. Despite this, prior to the mid-nineteenth century, options trading was a relatively esoteric activity confined to a specialized group of traders. Having attracted passing mention by Cohn [3], Castelli [1, p.2] identifies \"the great want of a popular treatise\" on options as the reason for undertaking a detailed treatment of mostly speculative option trading strategies. In a brief treatment, Castelli uses put–call parity in an arbitrage trade combining a short position in \"Turks 5%\" in Constantinople with a written put and purchased call in London. The trade is executed to take advantage of \"<i>enormous contangoes</i> collected at Constantinople\" [1, p.74–77].</p>",

Consider the modern Italian variants: <i>arbitraggio</i> is the term for arbitrage; <i>arbitrato</i> is arbitration or umpiring; and, <i>arbitrarer</i> is to arbitrate. Similarly, for modern French variants, <i>arbitrage</i> is arbitration; <i>arbitrer</i> is to arbitrate a quarrel or to umpire; and <i>arbitre</i> is an arbitrator or umpire. Recognizing that the \"arbitration of prices\" concept underlying arbitrage predates Roman times, the historical origin where the word arbitrage or a close variant was first used in relation to arbitrating differences in prices is unknown. A possible candidate involves arbitration of exchange rates for different currencies observed at the medieval fairs, around the time of the First Crusade (1100). The dominance of Italian bankers in this era indicates the first usage was the close variant, <i>arbitrio</i>, with the French \"<i>arbitrage</i>\" coming into usage during the eighteenth century. Religious and social restrictions effectively barred public discussion of the execution and profitability of such banking activities during the Middle Ages, though account books of the merchant banks do remain as evidence that there was significant arbitrage trading.</p>",

In contrast, a similar text in Italian, <i>Il Negotiante</i> (1638) by Giovanni Peri [18], a seventeenth century Italian merchant, has a detailed discussion on exchange dealings. Peri states that profit is the objective of all trade and that the \"activity directed to this end is subject to chance, which mocks at every calculation. Yet there is still ample space for reasonable calculation in which the possibility of adverse fortunes is never left out of account\" [5, p.327]. This mental activity engaged in the service of business is called <i>arbitrio</i>. Peri identifies a connection between speculation on future exchange rate movements and the <i>arbitrio</i> concept of arbitrage: \"the profits from exchange dealings originate in price differences and not in time\" with profits turning to losses if re-exchange is unfavorable [18, p.150]. For Peri, the connection between speculation and arbitrage applies to commodities and specie, as well as bills of exchange.</p>",

From the brief reference in a glossary of terms by de la Porte, a number of French sources, including the section <i>Trait´e des arbitrages</i> by Mondoteguy in Le Moine, <i>Le Negoce d'Amsterdam</i> [11] and Savary, <i>Diction</i><i>naire Universel de Commerce</i> (1730, 2nd ed.) [30], developed a more detailed presentation of arbitrage transactions involving bills of exchange. An important eighteenth century English source, <i>The Univer</i><i>sal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce</i> [24], is an expanded translation of Savary where the French word \"arbitrage\" is translated into English as \"arbitration\". This is consistent with the linguistic convention of referring to arbitration instead of arbitrage found in the earlier English source, <i>The Merchant's</i> <i>Public Counting House</i> [23]. This led to the common English use of the terms \"simple arbitrations\", \"compound arbitrations\", and \"arbitrated rates\". The practice of using arbitration instead of arbitrage continues into nineteenth century works by Patrick Kelly, <i>The Universal Cambist</i> [10] and William Tate, <i>The</i> <i>Modern Cambist</i> [34]. The latter book went into six editions.</p>",

Haupt produced similar works in German and French that used \"arbitrage\" to describe the calculation of parity relationships. A pamphlet by Maurice Cohn, <i>The Stock Exchange Arbitrageur</i> [3] describes \"arbitrage transactions\" between bourses but also uses \"arbitration\" to refer to calculated parity relationships. Charles Castelli's <i>The Theory of</i> <i>\"Options\" in Stocks and Shares</i> [1] concludes with a section on \"combination of options with arbitrage operations\" where arbitrage has exclusive use and no mention is made of \"arbitration\" of prices or rates across different locations. Following <i>Arbitrage</i> <i>in Bullion, Coins, Bills, Stocks, Shares and Options</i> by Henry Deutsch [4], \"arbitration of exchange\" is no longer commonly used.</p>",
