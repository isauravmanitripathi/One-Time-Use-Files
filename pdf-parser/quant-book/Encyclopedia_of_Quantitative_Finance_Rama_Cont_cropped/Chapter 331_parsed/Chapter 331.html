    Liquidity Premium

  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An asset is liquid if it can be traded quickly and at low cost. In addition to risk, liquidity affects asset prices and returns. Because investors want to be compensated for bearing the costs of illiquidity,
   <i>
    asset returns are increasing in illiquidity
   </i>
   . Thus, asset prices should depend on two asset characteristics: risk and liquidity.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Illiquidity reflects the costs of executing a transaction in the capital markets. These costs include three components:
  </p>
  <p block-type="ListGroup">
   <ul>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     1.
     <i>
      Price-impact costs
     </i>
     reflect the price concession that a buyer or seller makes when trading, or the price of immediacy: a discount when selling or a premium when buying. For small orders, the market impact is confined to the
     <i>
      bid–ask spread
     </i>
     ("spread"), which is the difference between the buying and selling price currently quoted by dealers or market-makers. For large orders, the price impact exceeds the spread and generally increases in the order size.
     <i>
      Depth
     </i>
     is the largest order size for which the price-impact cost is confined to the bid–ask spread.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     2.
     <i>
      Search and delay costs
     </i>
     are incurred when a trader searches for better prices than those quoted in the market or wishes to reduce the price impact of his/her order. This often occurs with block orders, where traders prefer to search for counterparties rather than "dump" the entire order on the market. While reducing price-impact costs, the trader bears search and delay costs because the trade is not executed immediately. In particular, the trader incurs opportunity costs and risk while holding the position as the order awaits execution. For example, for a trader who wishes to sell a stock, its price may decline while he/she is searching for a counterparty. The trader then trades off the benefit of a lower price-impact cost against the risk of the market turning against him/her.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     3.
     <i>
      Direct trading costs
     </i>
     include exchange fees, taxes, and brokerage commissions. These are also subject to trade-offs: For example, a trader may ask a dealer to liquidate a block, with the dealer bearing the search and delay cost while the trader pays a larger commission.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The three components of transaction costs are highly correlated: Assets with high price-impact costs or high bid–ask spread often have high search and delay costs and high brokerage commissions. Other measures of liquidity are correlated with these three components. For example, more liquid stocks (by the above measures) usually have greater turnover or trading volume and larger market capitalization.

    How Does Liquidity Affect Asset Prices?
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We have developed a model that shows how liquidity affects asset prices [4]. The model characterizes assets by their transaction costs and investors by their investment horizons. Each investor maximizes the expected present value of the cash flows that his/her assets generate considering the costs of transacting. In equilibrium, the return on an asset is an increasing function of its illiquidity costs because investors require a compensation for bearing these costs. The relation between illiquidity and return is increasing and concave, that is, the increase in return is mitigated for less liquid assets, which are held by investors with longer investment horizons who can depreciate their transaction costs over a longer period of time. The positive effect of illiquidity on stock returns is more prominent for liquid assets, which trade—and hence bear the transaction costs—more frequently.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Although the illiquidity costs of a single transaction are low relative to the asset price (for most publicly traded securities, they are a fraction of a percent), their
   <i>
    cumulative
   </i>
   effect on value is large because they are incurred repeatedly over the security's life. Thus, the impact of illiquidity costs should equal
   <i>
    at least
   </i>
   the present value of all costs incurred currently and in the future, which can be substantial relative to the value of a stock, whose life is infinite. Further, less liquid securities produce in equilibrium higher after-transaction-costs (net) returns to long-term investors. Higher returns are necessary to induce long-term investors to hold illiquid securities rather than compete with short-term investors for the more liquid securities.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We present empirical evidence on the effects of liquidity on asset prices and expected returns. For stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments, the lower the liquidity, the higher the return or the lower the price (after controlling for other characteristics, such as risk). The evidence further shows that riskaverse investors price illiquidity risk.

    Liquidity and Stock Returns

  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We tested the return–illiquidity relationship on NYSE-AMEX stocks during 1960–1980 [4, 6]. We divided stocks into seven portfolios by their spread, a common measure of illiquidity, and into seven portfolios based on their
   <i>
    β
   </i>
   coefficient, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)-based measure of risk, amounting to a total of 49 (7 × 7) portfolios. In a cross-sectional estimation of the average return on each portfolio as a function of the spread and unsystematic risk, we found that average portfolio returns were significantly higher for stocks with higher spreads. The function was increasing and concave, as predicted by our model. The following formula and chart summarize our results:

   is the spread (as a fraction of price). To illustrate, increasing the spread from 1% to 2% increased the average monthly return by 0.3% (= 0

   ) or about 3.6% per annum. The spread effect remained significant after controlling for firm size.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Subsequent studies support the theory that higher illiquidity entails higher expected returns, after controlling for risk and other characteristics, using a number of alternative measures of liquidity. Brennan and Subramanyam [13] use each stock's price-impact cost (per unit of order size) as well as the fixed cost associated with the spread, finding a strong positive relationship between average stock returns and both measures of illiquidity. Datar
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [17] measure liquidity using stock turnover (the ratio of trading volume to shares outstanding), and [12] use trading volume to measure liquidity. Both studies find that the higher the liquidity, the lower the stock's return after controlling for risk and other characteristics. This relationship, which is consistent with the theory, is found to be very robust.

   issued by companies that already have identical stocks traded in the public market. Thus, we observe two securities—the publicly traded stock and the same-company restricted stock—with the only difference between them being their liquidity. Consistent with the theory, Silber [21] finds that the average price of the restricted stock is 34% lower than that of the corresponding publicly traded

    Liquidity and Bond Yields
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We tested the liquidity effect by examining the differences between US Treasury bills and notes with less than six months to maturity [7]. For these maturities, both securities are discount instruments and when maturities are matched, they are completely identical, except that Treasury bills are much more liquid than notes. The average spread on bills in our sample is 0.00775% compared to 0.0303% for notes. The brokerage fees are $12.5–$25 per $1 000 000 value for bills and $78.125 per $1 000 000 for notes. Similarly, notes have a higher price-impact cost than bills. Because notes are less liquid than bills with the same maturity, our theory predicts that their yields should be higher. We tested the liquidity effect for 37 randomly selected days between April and November of 1987, analyzing 489 matches of notes and bills with the same maturities. As predicted, we found that the annual yield to maturity on notes was 0.43% higher than on bills with the same maturity. Kamara [18] finds that the note–bill yield differential holds after controlling for a number of security characteristics. A similar pattern is observed in the bond market in the yield differential between on-the-run bonds, which are most recently issued, and their less liquid offthe-run counterparts, whose maturity is only slightly shorter since they were issued earlier. A number of studies document a lower yield to maturity for on-therun bonds compared to their off-the-run counterpart [19, 22]. In addition, the note–bill yield spread can be viewed as the difference between off- and on-the-run securities.

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Corporate bonds have higher yields than similarmaturity Government bonds, and within corporate bonds, lower rated bonds have yet higher yields. This yield differential has traditionally been attributed to differences in the risk of default, which is surely higher for corporate bonds and yet higher for lower rated bonds. However, if illiquidity costs are higher on corporate bonds and on riskier bonds, part of the yield differential is due to illiquidity. This issue is studied by Chen
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [16]. They estimate the illiquidity cost of corporate bonds and find that it generally increases as the bond rating declines. Then,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   they estimate the effect of illiquidity on bond yields across bonds, controlling for risk, issuer characteristics, and the bond's special features. They find that illiquidity has a strong positive and robust effect on bond yields. Further,
   <i>
    changes
   </i>
   in bonds' illiquidity costs lead to changes in bond yields, as predicted. In the United States, Rule 144A bonds, which are less liquid corporate bonds whose trading is restricted to "qualified investors," exhibit a significant discount. Chaplinsky and Ramchand [15] find that the yield on Rule 144A bonds is 0.49% higher than on unrestricted bonds with similar characteristics. The differential is particularly large for investment-grade bonds.

    Liquidity Changes Over Time and Liquidity Risk

  <p block-type="Text">
   Just as liquidity affects asset prices across securities, liquidity
   <i>
    changes
   </i>
   over time bring about
   <i>
    changes
   </i>
   in asset prices. One example is the October 19, 1987 stock market crash in the United States. Amihud
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [11] propose that the crash resulted partly from a decline in investors' perception of the overall market liquidity compared to the precrash level. Consequently, investors priced securities lower, which led to the crash. Studying NYSE stocks in the S&amp;P 500 list, they find that on October 19th, the dollar spread increased by more than 63% compared to its precrash level, and the quoted depth also declined significantly. The sharp decline in market liquidity followed a period when investors had believed the market could absorb large order flows with a small effect on prices. The study finds that across stocks, those whose price declined the most on the crash day were those with the greatest deterioration in liquidity, and the stocks that recovered most by the end of October 1987 were those whose liquidity improved the most.

   Stock liquidity changes when a market trading system is improved. Around the world, markets have been moving from daily call-auction trading to more liquid, higher frequency trading. Amihud
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [9] study the effect of moving stocks in the Israeli stock market from once-a-day call auction to a higher frequency trading regime. They show that stocks that moved to the improved trading system enjoyed greater liquidity (greater turnover and lower volatility-to-volume ratio) as well as a sharp increase in value of at least 6%. Subsequent studies obtain
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   similar results for other markets that improved their trading systems and became more liquid.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Market liquidity changes not only in response to singular events but also over time for economic reasons. The question that arises is whether this affects stock prices over time. Amihud [2] finds that when market illiquidity rises unexpectedly, stock prices fall and subsequent expected return rises, consistent with our theory. The effect of liquidity shocks on realized current returns and on subsequent expected return is particularly strong for small, illiquid stocks, because of a "flight to liquidity," namely, to larger stocks that are less vulnerable to liquidity shocks.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   It follows that for risk-averse investors, a security's
   <i>
    liquidity risk
   </i>
   , measured by the exposure of its value to liquidity shocks, should affect its price and expected return. Pastor and Stambaugh [20] and Acharya and Pedersen [1] find that stocks whose return is more sensitive to market illiquidity shocks have, on average, higher average return (controlling for other stock characteristics). In addition, Acharya and Pedersen find that, within a CAPM model that allows for liquidity risk, higher sensitivity of stock illiquidity to market illiquidity as well as higher sensitivity of stock illiquidity to the market return also bring about higher expected stock returns. That is, systematic liquidityb risk is priced.

   <b>
    Some Investment Implications
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The theory and empirical results suggest that liquidity is priced: for any given level of risk, more illiquid securities have lower price or higher expected return or yield. Risk, too, lowers securities' prices, but there is a large difference between what investors can do to mitigate the costs of risk and illiquidity. To reduce risk, investors can diversify their holdings. Since most of securities' risk is idiosyncratic (uncorrelated across securities), a diversified portfolio enables investors to get rid of most of the risk, exposing investors only to systematic, diversifiable risk. And, while the total economy's risk is not diversifiable, an investor can hedge the market risk using appropriate market instruments (e.g., derivatives). In contrast, the cost of illiquidity cannot be diversified away. It is additive, so a portfolio of illiquid stock remains illiquid. Still, illiquidity can be managed by constructing a portfolio of securities with
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   different liquidity, ranging from cash-equivalents (the most liquid) to small, infrequently traded stocks and bonds. The objective is to reduce the frequency of trading in the least-liquid securities, thus enjoying their higher return while not bearing the full cost. Instruments that deal with the lower liquidity of small or risky stocks are closed-end funds and exchangetraded funds (ETFs) of such stocks. Trading these relatively traded funds absolves the trader from bearing the higher transaction costs of the underlying stocks. Consistent with the theory, Chan
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [14] find that liquid closed-end funds of countries with low-liquidity stocks trade at a premium (or lower discount).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Asset managers usually focus on stock selection and market timing. However, the manager's skill in buying and selling the positions they manage has a substantial affect on fund performance. In particular, managing the trading so as to minimize transaction costs helps improve fund performance. For example, an alternative to a sale of a large quantity of shares may be to split the order and sell it in pieces in a way that provides an optimal trade-off between lowering the cost of trading and increasing the risk that results from spreading the execution over time.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Because systematic liquidity risk is also priced in addition to the ordinary CAPM
   <i>
    β
   </i>
   , portfolio optimization must take this risk into account. As transaction costs affect the
   <i>
    net return
   </i>
   on stocks, reducing the risk of net portfolio return calls for portfolio strategies that reduce the exposure of the stock's return and liquidity costs to the market return and to market liquidity shocks.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    Some Corporate Finance Implications
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The effect of liquidity on the return required by investors means that a company can reduce its cost of capital by increasing the liquidity of its stocks or bonds. The company can thus increase its market value for any given cash flows that it generates, by employing liquidity-enhancing strategies. We suggested [5, 8] a number of such strategies. One strategy is increasing the company's investor base, especially by adding small individual investors, increases liquidity and raises the stock price. Amihud
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [10] find that when Japanese companies made their stocks more accessible to small investors by reducing the minimum trading unit, their investor bases increased,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   resulting in an increase in stock liquidity and price. In general, the investor base can be increased by making it easier to trade the company's stocks and bonds (e.g., inducing more dealers to make a market in the company's bonds) and advertising the company so that individual investors are familiar with it.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Liquidity is also enhanced by providing voluntarily more information about the company, since it reduces the asymmetry of information about its value. This can be done by providing transparent financial reporting, making prompt announcements of new information, and facilitating the provision of information to the public, for example, through analysts.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Liquidity is also improved by reducing fragmentation in trading the stocks and bonds of a company. Amihud
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [3] find that when two virtually identical securities are traded in the market—in that case, stock and deep-in-the-money warrants of the same company—the stock's value rises when the warrant is exercised, which eliminates fragmentation and makes the stock more liquid (since its outstanding value increases). In general, the larger the stock or bond issue, the greater its liquidity and the higher its value. This means that the benefits of having multiple classes of stock or small series of bonds should be considered against the resulting reduced liquidity, which raises the corporate cost of capital.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    Concluding Remarks
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Expected asset returns depend on their liquidity (or marketability) in addition to risk. For both bonds and stocks, the less liquid the asset, the higher its return (after controlling for risk). Further, the effects of liquidity on asset values and returns are larger than one might naively expect, because the costs of illiquidity are incurred repeatedly, whenever the asset is traded.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   These results have important implications for investments, corporate financial decisions, and public policy. Securities analysis should incorporate, in addition to cash flows and risk considerations, the liquidity of the security and possible changes in it. Trading and portfolio construction strategies should incorporate liquidity considerations. Companies that issue securities should opt to enhance their liquidity in order to increase their price. And companies should employ strategies that make their publicly traded securities more liquid. Finally, there is value in public
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   policy that increases market liquidity, which reduces the corporate cost of capital and improves overall economic performance.
