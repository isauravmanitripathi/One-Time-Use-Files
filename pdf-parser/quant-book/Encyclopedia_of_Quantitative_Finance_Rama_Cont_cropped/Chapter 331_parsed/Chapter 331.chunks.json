For small orders, the market impact is confined to the <i>bid–ask spread</i> (\"spread\"), which is the difference between the buying and selling price currently quoted by dealers or market-makers. For large orders, the price impact exceeds the spread and generally increases in the order size. <i>Depth</i> is the largest order size for which the price-impact cost is confined to the bid–ask spread.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">2. <i>Search and delay costs</i> are incurred when a trader searches for better prices than those quoted in the market or wishes to reduce the price impact of his/her order. This often occurs with block orders, where traders prefer to search for counterparties rather than \"dump\" the entire order on the market. While reducing price-impact costs, the trader bears search and delay costs because the trade is not executed immediately. In particular, the trader incurs opportunity costs and risk while holding the position as the order awaits execution. For example, for a trader who wishes to sell a stock, its price may decline while he/she is searching for a counterparty. The trader then trades off the benefit of a lower price-impact cost against the risk of the market turning against him/her.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\">3. <i>Direct trading costs</i> include exchange fees, taxes, and brokerage commissions. These are also subject to trade-offs: For example, a trader may ask a dealer to liquidate a block, with the dealer bearing the search and delay cost while the trader pays a larger commission.</li></ul></p>",

The model characterizes assets by their transaction costs and investors by their investment horizons. Each investor maximizes the expected present value of the cash flows that his/her assets generate considering the costs of transacting. In equilibrium, the return on an asset is an increasing function of its illiquidity costs because investors require a compensation for bearing these costs. The relation between illiquidity and return is increasing and concave, that is, the increase in return is mitigated for less liquid assets, which are held by investors with longer investment horizons who can depreciate their transaction costs over a longer period of time. The positive effect of illiquidity on stock returns is more prominent for liquid assets, which trade—and hence bear the transaction costs—more frequently.</p>",

Thus, the impact of illiquidity costs should equal <i>at least</i> the present value of all costs incurred currently and in the future, which can be substantial relative to the value of a stock, whose life is infinite. Further, less liquid securities produce in equilibrium higher after-transaction-costs (net) returns to long-term investors. Higher returns are necessary to induce long-term investors to hold illiquid securities rather than compete with short-term investors for the more liquid securities.</p>",

For these maturities, both securities are discount instruments and when maturities are matched, they are completely identical, except that Treasury bills are much more liquid than notes. The average spread on bills in our sample is 0.00775% compared to 0.0303% for notes. The brokerage fees are $12.5–$25 per $1 000 000 value for bills and $78.125 per $1 000 000 for notes. Similarly, notes have a higher price-impact cost than bills. Because notes are less liquid than bills with the same maturity, our theory predicts that their yields should be higher. We tested the liquidity effect for 37 randomly selected days between April and November of 1987, analyzing 489 matches of notes and bills with the same maturities. As predicted, we found that the annual yield to maturity on notes was 0.43% higher than on bills with the same maturity. Kamara [18] finds that the note–bill yield differential holds after controlling for a number of security characteristics. A similar pattern is observed in the bond market in the yield differential between on-the-run bonds, which are most recently issued, and their less liquid offthe-run counterparts, whose maturity is only slightly shorter since they were issued earlier. A number of studies document a lower yield to maturity for on-therun bonds compared to their off-the-run counterpart [19, 22]. In addition, the note–bill yield spread can be viewed as the difference between off- and on-the-run securities.</p>",

Consequently, investors priced securities lower, which led to the crash. Studying NYSE stocks in the S&amp;P 500 list, they find that on October 19th, the dollar spread increased by more than 63% compared to its precrash level, and the quoted depth also declined significantly. The sharp decline in market liquidity followed a period when investors had believed the market could absorb large order flows with a small effect on prices. The study finds that across stocks, those whose price declined the most on the crash day were those with the greatest deterioration in liquidity, and the stocks that recovered most by the end of October 1987 were those whose liquidity improved the most.</p>",

Risk, too, lowers securities' prices, but there is a large difference between what investors can do to mitigate the costs of risk and illiquidity. To reduce risk, investors can diversify their holdings. Since most of securities' risk is idiosyncratic (uncorrelated across securities), a diversified portfolio enables investors to get rid of most of the risk, exposing investors only to systematic, diversifiable risk. And, while the total economy's risk is not diversifiable, an investor can hedge the market risk using appropriate market instruments (e.g., derivatives). In contrast, the cost of illiquidity cannot be diversified away. It is additive, so a portfolio of illiquid stock remains illiquid.

In general, the larger the stock or bond issue, the greater its liquidity and the higher its value. This means that the benefits of having multiple classes of stock or small series of bonds should be considered against the resulting reduced liquidity, which raises the corporate cost of capital.</p>",
