    Optimization Methods
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   No area of computational mathematics plays a greater role in the support of financial decision making and strategy development than numerical optimization. The full gamut of optimization methodologies are applied to this end—linear and quadratic, nonlinear and global, stochastic and deterministic, discrete and continuous—and applications propagate throughout the front office, back office, analysis, and trading operations. The use of optimization is deep, pervasive, and growing.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We organize our presentation in three "levels". The top level in our presentation is the management of portfolios based on quadratic programming, the second level is stochastic programming for portfolio optimization, and the lowest (but perhaps the most important) level is model calibration (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Model Calibration
   </b>
   ).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   While some of the methodological issues that arise are specific to the different levels, there are three dominant themes that cut across all levels: speed, robustness, and quality of solution. Speed often dominates thinking in financial circles since rapid informed decision making (sometimes, "automatic") can translate into capital gains (conversely, lack of sufficient speed can lead to losses). Nevertheless, a "wrong" answer computed at record speed is not of much value (and could be quite disastrous). A solution can be wrong in several ways. For example, if the computed solution is not robust, then the resultant strategy may be a very poor strategy under slight tweaking of the parameters defining the problem. This is a serious practical problem because problem parameters are almost always determined in an approximate manner (i.e., they are not known exactly). Other solution quality issues can arise. For example, some optimization problems are too hard to solve in reasonable time and so approximation schemes must be used. But how good is the approximate solution?

   As we discuss some of the optimization challenges that arise under the organizing levels mentioned above, we make particular note of these three unifying numerical concerns.

   The most famous optimization application in finance is the mean–variance portfolio optimization problem, first introduced by Markowitz [19];

   <b>
    Risk–Return Analysis
   </b>
   . The question that is addressed by "mean–variance portfolio optimization" is both easy to understand and practical: how should one distribute, across a given set of financial instruments, a finite investment in order to balance (according to the investors preference) risk and expected return? In its pure form, this question can be formulated as a positive definite quadratic programming problem.

   ≥ 0 is a risk aversion parameter. Additional (linear) constraints can be imposed, for example, no short selling constraints correspond to
   <i>
    x
   </i>
   ≥ 0. There are many good algorithms, and codes (e.g., MOSEK and LOQO [24]) to solve positive definite quadratic programming problems, but the situation becomes more complex (and more interesting) as financial (and numerical) concerns are introduced.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   One complication arises in the equity setting: portfolios held in many firms can be quite large—in several thousands—and typically have a dense matrix
   <i>
    Q
   </i>
   ; nevertheless, there is serious need to determine a solution rapidly. Moreover, because many of the subsets of instruments in the portfolio behave in a highly correlated way the matrix
   <i>
    Q
   </i>
   can be illconditioned. This means numerical algorithms can have a hard time computing accurate answers, and small changes in the input data can lead to very different proposed strategies and portfolios. One approach to address these difficulties is to use a factor model. However, algorithm implementation needs to exploit this special structure of the covariance matrix for optimal computational efficiency.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Another complication is the need to use additional terms, for example, to capture transaction costs (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Transaction Costs
   </b>
   ). These additional terms yield a more realistic model; however, they may also change the objective function into a more nonlinear function. This apparent small change has a big impact—general nonlinear codes (even with linear constraints) are more complex and have fewer "guarantees" relative to quadratic objective functions.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Recently, there has been considerable attention paid to the fact that the objective function in equation (1) is just an approximation to reality. Estimation of expected returns is notoriously difficult; the expected return parameter may be closer to wishful thinking than reality. Specifically, return
   <i>
    µ
   </i>
   and covariance matrix
   <i>
    Q
   </i>
   are supposed to represent the return and risk going forward in time but are typically, in fact, the return and risk going backward. The question is, how well does our chosen portfolio (i.e., the optimization solution based on these estimated parameters) perform as reality rolls forward under real conditions? Unfortunately, the answer is that it may not do very well at all; see for example, [5, 6].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   There is now considerable attention being paid to this very practical concern, generally under the label "robust optimization"; see for example, [14, 15, 23], and
   <b>
    Robust Portfolio Optimization
   </b>
   . The goal of robust optimization is to guarantee the best performance in the worse case. Since the support for an uncertain parameter may be infinite, a robust portfolio is typically determined by considering optimal performance in the worst case within some uncertainty sets for model parameters. For example, the min–max robust formulation for equation (1) can be expressed as
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \min_{x} \quad \max_{\mu \in \mathcal{S}_{\mu}, Q \in \mathcal{S}_{Q}} -\mu^{T} x + \lambda x^{T} Q x

   and covariance matrix

Efficient computational methods for conic optimization and semidefinite programming can be used to solve some of these robust optimization problems; see, for example, [11].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   There is need for still more research here though since much of the work to date takes an unduly conservative—and expensive—point of view: given a range to capture the possibility values of the parameters, solve the problem in the worst case. This solution provides protection but is certainly on the extreme risk-averse side. Recently, a conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) robust formulation is considered in [25] to address uncertainty in the parameters for mean–variance portfolio optimization.

    CVaR Minimization and Optimal Executions: Stochastic Programming
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Optimal financial decisions often need to be made using uncertain parameters which describe the optimization problems. This view leads to stochastic programming problems.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Even in a single-period portfolio optimization framework, if instrument values (e.g., options) depend nonlinearly on the risk factors, a different risk measure, instead of standard deviation, for example, Value-at-Risk (VaR) (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Value-at-Risk
   </b>
   ) or CVaR (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Expected Shortfall
   </b>
   ), needs to be used. Both these measures quantify near-worst case losses and both present interesting optimization challenges.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   VaR is essentially a quantile of a loss distribution. For a confidence level
   <i>
    β
   </i>
   , for example, 95%, the VaR of a portfolio is the loss in the portfolio's market value over a specified time horizon that is exceeded with probability 1 −
   <i>
    β
   </i>
   . When VaR is used as a risk measure, the portfolio optimization problem is, in general, a nonconvex programming problem. Computing a global minimizer remains a computationally challenging task.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An alternative risk measure to VaR is CVaR. When the distribution of the portfolio loss is continuous, for a given time horizon and a confidence level
   <i>
    β
   </i>
   , CVaR is the conditional expectation of the loss exceeding VaR. In contrast to VaR, CVaR provides additional information on the magnitude of the excess loss. It has been shown that CVaR is a coherent risk measure; see for example, [3, 21]. In addition, minimizing CVaR typically leads to a portfolio with a small VaR.

   There are a host of numerical challenges and issues that arise in the calibration setting but we only mention a few of them here. The foremost, without a doubt, is the reliability of the data (and the volume of data to be used). Data reliability can lead to preprocessing steps such as filtering, and, in some cases, choosing an optimization formulation that is relatively insensitive to data errors (e.g., least-squares minimization is much more sensitive to (erroneous) outliers than absolute-value minimization).

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Avoiding overfitting is also a major issue. In order for a model to calibrate some market information, for example, market option prices, one needs to consider a family of sufficiently complex models. For example, it is well known that the classical Black-Scholes model is inadequate to calibrate equity option prices and more complex models such as local volatility function models (see Local Volatility Model), jump models (see Exponential Lévy Models), and stochastic volatility models (see
   <b>
    Heston Model

   ) have been proposed. When a family of complex models such as local volatility function models are considered, it is crucial to avoid overfitting data; see for example, [8]. Even when

  <p block-type="Text">
   a family of models are described by a few model parameters, the question of whether there exists sufficient information to robustly determine model parameters still remains; see, for example, jump model calibration problems [10, 18].

   , which is typically done through numerical computation methods for partial differential equations or using Monte Carlo simulations. A good initial guess for the model parameters can also be crucial in ensuring success in obtaining a solution. We note that automatic differentiation may also be a useful computational tool in accurately computing the Jacobian matrices ∇
