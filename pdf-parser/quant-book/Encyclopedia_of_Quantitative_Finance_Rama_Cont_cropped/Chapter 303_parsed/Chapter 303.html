    Economic Capital

   Allocation
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In a bank, risk is usually quantified in terms of risk capital (or economic capital). The reason for the close connection between risk and capital is the fact that the main purpose of the bank's capital is to provide protection against extreme losses, that is, capital invested in safe and liquid assets should ensure solvency of the bank even in adverse economic scenarios. Hence, the capital requirements of a bank are determined by its risk profile. The actual calculation is based on risk measures like Value-at-Risk (VaR) or expected shortfall; see [12] or
   <b>
    Convex Risk Measures
   </b>
   for an exposition of the theory of risk measures.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Techniques for measuring risk are not only required for capital management but are also prerequisites for profitability analysis and portfolio optimization. The development of the theoretical relationship between risk and expected return is built on two economic theories: portfolio theory and capital market theory [18, 19, 25]. Portfolio theory deals with the selection of portfolios that maximize the expected returns consistent with individually acceptable levels of risk, whereas capital market theory focuses on the relationship between security returns and risk. These theories also provide a natural framework for measuring profitability. The profitability analysis is commonly carried out by expressing the risk-return relationship as simple rational functions of risk and return components. The two basic variants of these so-called risk adjusted ratios are known as
   <i>
    RORAC
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    RAROC
   </i>
   , respectively; see

   for details.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Portfolio optimization and the profitability analysis of individual business units, portfolios, and transactions require the quantification of risk at the respective levels of the bank's hierarchy. In line with portfolio theory, the main objective of this analysis is to measure the contribution of each unit to the total risk of the bank and to allocate risk capital accordingly. For a mathematical formalization of the allocation problem, we assume that a risk measure
   <math display="inline">
    \rho
   </math>
   has been fixed and that X is a portfolio that consists of subportfolios
   <math display="inline">
    X_1, \ldots, X_m
   </math>
   . The objective is to distribute the risk capital
   <math display="inline">
    k := \rho(X)
   </math>
   of the portfolio
   <math display="inline">
    X = X_1 + \cdots + X_m

   In recent years, theoretical and practical aspects of different allocation schemes have been analyzed in several articles; see for instance
   <math display="inline">
    [5-8, 11, 14, 22, 23,
   </math>
   26–28]. An allocation scheme proposed by several authors is the allocation by the gradient or Euler principle: the capital allocated to the subportfolio
   <math display="inline">
    X_i
   </math>
   of
   <math display="inline">
    X
   </math>
   is the derivative of the associated risk measure
   <math display="inline">
    \rho
   </math>
   at X in the direction of
   <math display="inline">
    X_i
   </math>
   (see formula (9) for a precise formalization). In the following, we review a simple axiomatization of capital allocation proposed in [15]. The main axioms are the property that the entire risk capital of a portfolio is allocated to its subportfolios and a diversification property that is closely linked to the subadditivity of the underlying risk measure. It turns out that in this framework the Euler principle is an immediate consequence of the proposed axioms.

   The Euler principle is an allocation scheme that has been proposed by several authors; see [28] for an overview. Tasche [26] argues that allocation based on the Euler principle provides the right signals for performance measurement. Another justification for the Euler principle is given by Denault [8] using the framework of cooperative game theory. He shows that the Euler principle is the only fair allocation principle for a differentiable coherent risk measure. The existence of the directional derivative (9) is analyzed in several articles, for example, in [4, 11, 13, 27]. Alternative allocation techniques have been explored in the actuarial sciences; see, for example, [9, 21]. A comparison of different combinations of risk measures and allocation methods can be found in [29].
