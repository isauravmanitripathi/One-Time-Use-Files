    Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs)
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are indexed products and trade like equities on the main exchanges. Technically, an ETF holder possesses certificates that state legal right of ownership over a portion of a basket of individual stock certificates. It may be tempting to think of ETFs as mutual funds. However, ETFs differ from mutual funds in several ways. One key distinction is that mutual funds only trade at the end of each day at their calculated NAVs while ETFs trade throughout the day at ever-changing prices. Another is that ETFs, unlike mutual funds, can be sold short.

   A number of financial entities are required to create and maintain ETFs. Initially, the fund manger submits a detailed plan to SEC as to the ETF's constitution and how it will function. Once the plan is approved, the fund manager enters into an agreement with a market maker or specialist known as the
   <i>
    authorized participant.
   </i>
   The authorized participant, typically by borrowing, begins to assemble a basket of instruments that compose the index the ETF is meant to replicate. Once assembled, the instruments are placed in trust at a custodial bank that, in turn, uses them to form what are know as
   <i>
    creation units
   </i>
   . Each creation unit represents a subset of the basket of instruments. The custodial bank then divides the creation units into (typically) 10 000 to 600 000 ETF shares [5], which are legal claims on the aforementioned instruments, and forwards the shares to the authorized participant. It should be mentioned that this is an in-kind trade (i.e., ETF shares are exchanged for the basket of financial instruments) with no tax implications. The authorized participant subsequently sells the shares in the open market just like shares of stock. The ETF shares then continue to be sold and resold by investors. The instruments underlying the creation units, and therefore the ETF shares, remain in trust with the custodian who is responsible for paying any cash flows (e.g., dividends and coupons) from the instruments to the ETF holders and providing administrative oversight of the creation units themselves.

   A long position in an ETF can be unwound two ways. The first is simply to sell the share in the open

   market. The second is to purchase enough ETF shares to form a creation unit and then exchange the creation unit for the securities that comprise it. As with the creation of the ETF shares, this second option has no tax implications but is generally only available to large institutional investors.

   The financial firms mentioned above are motivated to participate in the ETF space by different profit opportunities. Fund managers and custodial banks each collect a small portion of the fund's annual assets. Investors who loan instruments that compose the aforementioned baskets receive interest fees, while market makers seek to earn both arbitrage (i.e., the difference in price between the ETF and the basket of instruments) and bid/ask-spread profits.

  <p block-type="Text">
   According to a July 2008 Morningstar article, the average ETF charged 54 bps in annual fees [3]. This number was up from 41 bps a year earlier [3]. The average has been raised owing to recently formed exotic, narrowly focused ETFs. However, there are still many broad-market ETFs with annual fees on the order of 10 bps. Furthermore, an ETF's management fee is usually lower than the (approximately) 80 bps charged by the typical mutual fund [2]. Finally, over 90% of US ETFs have bid/ask spreads of fewer than 50 bps (with over half having spreads of fewer than 20 bps) [1], while the expense ratio (which includes management fees, administrative costs, 12b-1 distribution fees, and other operating expenses) for an average mutual fund is 150 bps [4]. Assuming one must transact at the bid (offer) when selling (buying), even ETFs with higher bid/ask spreads have, on average, substantially lower frictional costs than mutual funds (104 bps vs. 150 bps).

   There are close to 2000 ETFs trading today, tracking numerous broad-market composites as well as a multitude of sector and geographic indexes. These products cover approximately 40 different investment categories (e.g., Utilities Sector Equity, High Yield Fixed Income, US Real Estate Equity and European Mid/Small Cap Equity) and fall into several investment styles (e.g. equity, fixed income, and alternatives). Furthermore, these funds are offered by a large number of investment banks and investment management companies. Consequently, the ETF market gives investors numerous choices both in terms of the nature of investment and the fund manager.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In conclusion, a number of financial entities are necessary to create and maintain ETFs, indexed products that trade like stocks on major bourses. Furthermore, ETFs differ from mutual funds in that they trade throughout the day, can be shorted, and generally carry lower fees. Finally, the close to 2000 ETFs trading today cover a plethora of different investment categories, offering investors an inexpensive means to construct well-diversified portfolios.
