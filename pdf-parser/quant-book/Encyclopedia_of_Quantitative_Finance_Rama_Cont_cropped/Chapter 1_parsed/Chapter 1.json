His father, a native of Bordeaux, moved to Le Havre after his marriage to the daughter of a notable citizen of Le Havre. He started a wine and spirits shop, and bought and exported wines from Bordeaux and Champagne. At the time, Le Havre was an important port. The Protestant bourgeoisie in the city, which dominated the local cotton and coffee markets, occupied the upper echelons of society. The young Louis was educated at a high school in Le Havre. He seems to have been a fairly good student, but he interrupted his studies after earning his high school diploma in 1889, when both of his parents died in the span of a few weeks. To provide for his youngest brother and his older sister, most likely, he took over his father's business, but he sold it after a few years. In 1892, he completed his military service as an infantryman and then moved to Paris, where his activities are unclear. What is clear, however, is that Bachelier focused on his interests in the stock market and undertook university studies at the University of Paris, where in 1895 he obtained his bachelor's degree in the mathematical sciences, without being a particularly distinguished student. After earning his degree, he continued to attend the lectures of the Faculty, including courses in mathematical physics taught by Poincare and Boussinesq. ´</p>",

The stock market is subject to innumerable random influences, and so it is unreasonable to expect a mathematically precise forecast of stock prices. However, we can try to establish the law of the changes in stock prices over a fixed period of time. The determination of this law was the subject of Bachelier's thesis. The thesis was not particularly original. Since the early nineteenth century, people had applied probability theory to study exchange rates. In France, in particular, we can cite the work of Bicquilley (around 1800) or Jules Regnault (around 1850). In his thesis, Bachelier [1] intended to revisit this issue from several viewpoints taken from physics and probability theory, as these subjects were taught in Europe, including Paris, around 1900. He adapted these viewpoints to aid his investigation. The first method he used is the method adopted by Einstein, five years later, to determine the law of Brownian motion in a physical context. It consists of studying the integral equation that governs the probability that the change in price is <i>y</i> at time <i>t</i>, under two natural assumptions: the change in price during two separate time intervals is independent and the expectation of the change in price is zero. The resulting equation is a homogeneous version of the diffusion equation, now known as the <i>Kolmogorov</i> (or <i>Chapman–Kolmogorov</i>) <i>equation</i>, in which Bachelier boldly asserts that the appropriate solution is given by a centered Gaussian law with variance proportional to time <i>t</i>. He proved a statement already proposed, without justification, by Regnault in 1860 that the expectation of the absolute change in price after time <i>t</i> is proportional to the square root of <i>t</i>.</p>",

Since the change in price over a given period of time is the result of a very large number of independent random variables, it is not surprising that this change in price is Gaussian. But the extension of this approximation to a continuous-time version is not straightforward.

Bachelier proposes a third method, the \"radiation (or diffusion) of probability\". Bachelier, having attended the lectures of Poincaré and Boussinesq on the theory of heat, was aware of the \"method of Laplace\", which gives the fundamental solution of the heat equation, a solution that has exactly the form given by the first (and second) methods used by Bachelier. Hence, there is a coincidence to be elucidated. We know that Laplace probably knew the reason for this coincidence. Lord Rayleigh had recently noticed this coincidence in his solution to the problem of \"random phases\". It is likely that neither Bachelier nor Poincaré had read the work of Rayleigh. Anyway, Bachelier, in turn, explains this curious intersection between the theory of heat and the prices of annuities on the Paris stock exchange. This is his third method, which can be summarized as follows.</p>",

This \"demonstrates\" the role of Gaussian laws in problems related to the stock market, as acknowledged by Poincaré himself in his report: \"A little reflection shows that the analogy is real and the comparison legitimate. The arguments of Fourier are applicable, with very little change, to this problem that is so different from the problem to which these arguments were originally applied.\" And Poincaré regretted that Bachelier did not develop this point further, though this point would be developed in a masterly way by Kolmogorov in a famous article published in 1931 in the Mathematische Annalen. In fact, the first and third methods used by Bachelier are intrinsically linked: the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation for any regular Markov process is equivalent to a partial differential equation of parabolic type. In all regular Markovian schemes that are continuous, probability radiates like heat from a fire fanned by the thousand winds of chance. And further work, exploiting this real analogy, would transform not only the theory of Markov processes but also the century-old theory of Fourier equations and parabolic equations.</p>",

He proposed a general theory of speculation integrating all stock market products that could be proposed to clients, whose (expected) value at maturity—and therefore whose price—can be calculated using general formulas resulting from theory. The most remarkable product that Bachelier priced was based on the maximum value of a stock during the period between its purchase and a maturity date (usually one month later). In this case, one must determine the law of the maximum of a stock price over some interval of time. This problem would be of concern to Norbert Wiener, the inventor of the mathematical theory of Brownian motion, in 1923. It involves knowing <i>a priori</i> the law of the price over an infinite time interval, but it was not known—either in 1923 or in 1900—how to easily calculate the integrals of functions of an infinite number of variables. Let us explain the reasoning used by Bachelier [1] as an example of his methods of analysis.</p>",

It consists of discretizing time in steps of <math display=\"inline\">\\Delta t</math>, and introducing a change in price at each step of <math display=\"inline\">\\pm \\Delta x</math>. Bachelier wanted to calculate the probability that before time <math display=\"inline\">t = n\\Delta t</math>, the game (or price) exceeds a given value <math display=\"inline\">c = m\\Delta x</math>. Let <math display=\"inline\">n =</math><math display=\"inline\">m+2p</math>. Bachelier proposed to first calculate the probability that the price <math display=\"inline\">c</math> is reached for the first time at exactly time <math display=\"inline\">t</math>. To this end, he uses the gambler's ruin argument: the probability is equal to <math display=\"inline\">(m/n)C_n^p 2^{-n}</math>, which Bachelier obtained from the ballot formula of Bertrand, which he learned from Poincaré or Bertrand's work, or perhaps both. It suffices to then pass properly to the limit so that <math display=\"inline\">\\Delta x = \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\Delta t})</math>. One then obtains the probability that the price exceeds <math display=\"inline\">c</math> before <math display=\"inline\">t</math>.

The mathematical analysis available during his time could not deal with such strange objects and calculations. It was not until the following year, 1901, that Lebesgue introduced the integral based on the measure that Borel had just recently constructed. The Daniell integral, which Wiener used, dates to 1920 and it was not until the 1930s that European mathematicians realized that computing probabilities with respect to Brownian motion, or with respect to sequences of independent random variables, could be done using Lebesgue measure on the unit interval. Since Lebesgue's theory came to be viewed as one of the strongest pillars of analysis in the twentieth century, this approach gave probability theory a very strong analytic basis. We will have to wait much longer to place the stochastic calculus of Brownian motion and sample path arguments involving stopping times into a relatively uniform analytical framework. Anyway, Bachelier had little concern for either this new theory in analysis or the work of his contemporaries, whom he never cites. He refers to the work of Laplace, Bertrand, and Poincaré, who never cared about the Lebesgue integral, and so Bachelier always ignored its existence.</p>",

In 1906, Bachelier proposes an almost general theory of \"related probabilities\", that is to say, a theory about what would, 30 years later, be called <i>Markov processes</i>. This article by Bachelier was the starting point of a major study by Kolmogorov in 1931 that we already mentioned. All of Bachelier's work was published with the distant but caring recommendation of Poincare, so that by 1910, Bachelier, ´ whose income remains unknown and was probably modest, is permitted to teach a \"free course\" in probability theory at the Sorbonne, without compensation. Shortly thereafter, he won a scholarship that allowed him to publish his <i>Calculus of Probability</i>, Volume I, Paris, Gauthier-Villars, 1912 (Volume II never appeared), which included all of his work since his thesis. This very surprising book was not widely circulated in France, and had no impact on the Paris stock market or on French mathematics, but it was one of the sources that motivated work in stochastic processes at the Moscow School in the 1930s. It also influenced work by the American School on sums of independent random variables in the 1950s, and at the same time, influenced new theories in mathematical finance that were developing in the United States. And, as things should rightly be, these theories traced back to France, where Bachelier's name had become so well recognized that in 2000, the centennial anniversary of his work in \"theory of speculation\" was celebrated.</p>",

When the war ended in December 1918, he was a sublieutenant in the Army Service Corps. He served far from the front, but he carried out his service with honor. As a result, in 1919, the Directorate of Higher Education in Paris believed it was necessary to appoint Bachelier to a university outside of Paris, since the war had decimated the ranks of young French mathematicians and there were many positions to be filled. After many difficulties, due to his marginalization in the French mathematical community and the incongruent nature of his research, Bachelier finally received tenure in 1927 (at the age of 57) as a professor at the University of Besan¸con, where he remained until his retirement in 1937.

He seemed to be aware of the new theory of stochastic processes that was then developing in Paris and Moscow, and that was progressively spreading all over the world. He attempted to claim credit for the things that he had done, without any success. He regained his appetite for research, to the point that in 1941, at the age of 70, he submitted a note for publication to the Academy of Sciences in Paris on the \"probability of maximum oscillations\", in which he demonstrated a fine mastery of the theory of Brownian motion, which was undertaken systematically by Paul Levy starting in 1938. Paul Levy, the principal French researcher of the theory of Brownian motion, recognized, albeit belatedly, the work of Bachelier, and his work provided a more rigorous foundation for Bachelier's \"theory of speculation\".</p>",
