More than any other single contributor, it was Fama [7] in his 1965 dissertation, building on the work of Roberts, Cowles, and Cootner, who formulated the EMH, suggesting that stock prices reflect all available information, and that, consequently, the actual value of a security is equal to its price.

Regnault was the first author to put forward this hypothesis, to validate it empirically, and to give it a theoretical interpretation. In 1900, Louis Bachelier [1], a French mathematician, used Regnault's hypothesis and framework to develop the first mathematical model of Brownian motion, and tested the model by using it to price futures and options. In retrospect, we can recognize that Bachelier's doctoral dissertation constitutes the first work in mathematical finance. Unfortunately for him, however, financial economics did not then exist as a scientific field, and there was no organized scientific community interested in his research. Consequently, both Regnault and Bachelier were ignored by economists until the 1960s.</p>",

First, the Koopmansâ€“Vining controversy at the end of 1940s led to a decline of descriptive approaches and to the increased use of modeling based on theoretical foundations. Second, modern probability theory, and consequently also the theory of stochastic processes, became usable for nonmathematicians. Significantly, economists were attracted to the new formalisms by some features that were already familiar consequences of economic equilibrium. Most important, the zero expected profit when prices follow a Brownian motion reminded economists of the zero marginal profit in the equilibrium of a perfectly competitive market. Third, research on the stock market became more and more popular among scholars: groups of researchers and seminars in financial economics became organized; scientific journals such as the <i>Journal of Financial and Quantita</i><i>tive Analysis</i> were created and a community of scholars was born. This context raised awareness about the need for theoretical investigations, and these investigations, in turn, allowed the creation of the EMH.</p>",

However, this paper made no link with economic equilibrium and, probably for this reason, it was not widely diffused. Instead, it was Roberts [21], a professor at the University of Chicago, who first suggested a link between economic concepts and the random walk model by using the \"arbitrage proof\" argument that had been popularized by Modigliani and Miller [19]. Then, Cowles [5] made an important step by identifying a link between financial econometric results and economic equilibrium.

By contrast, economists from the University of Chicago claimed that real stock markets were perfect, and so were more inclined to characterize them as efficient. Thus, it was a scholar from the University of Chicago, Eugene Fama, who formulated the EMH.</p>",

In that account, the key assumption is the existence of \"sophisticated traders\" who, due to their skills, make a better estimate of intrinsic valuation than do other agents by using all available information. Provided that such traders have predominant access to financial resources, their activity of buying underpriced assets and selling overpriced assets will tend to make prices equal the intrinsic values about which they have a shared assessment and also to eliminate any expectation of profit from trading.

He simplified his first definition by making the implicit assumption of a representative agent. He also used another stochastic process: the martingale model, which had been introduced to model the random character of stock market prices by Samuelson [22] and Mandelbrot [17]. The martingale model is less restrictive than the random walk model: the martingale model requires only independence of the conditional expectation of price changes, whereas the random walk model requires also independence involving the higher conditional moments (i.e., variance, skewness, and kurtosis) of the probability distribution of price changes. For Fama's [8] purposes, the most important attraction of the martingale formalism was its explicit reference to a set of information, <i>t</i> ,</p>",

In addition, it is striking to note that the test suggested by Fama [9] (i.e., markets are efficient if stock prices are equal to the prediction provided by the model of equilibrium used) does not imply any clear causality between the random character of stock market prices and the EMH; it is mostly a plausible correlation valid only for some cases.</p>",

In retrospect, it is clear that the theoretical content of EMH comprised its suggestion of a link between some mathematical model, some empirical results, and some concept of economic equilibrium. The precise linkage proposed by Fama was, however, only one of many possible linkages, as subsequent literature would demonstrate. Just so, LeRoy [14] and Lucas [16] provided theoretical proofs that efficient markets and the martingale hypothesis are two distinct ideas: martingale is neither necessary nor sufficient for an efficient market. In a similar way, Samuelson [23], who gave a mathematical proof that prices may be permanently equal to the intrinsic value and fluctuate randomly, explained that it cannot be excluded that some agents make profits, contrary to the original definition of EMH. De Meyer and Saley [6] show that stock market prices follow a martingale even if all available information is not contained in stock market prices.</p>",

Moreover, some authors have used the weakness of the definitions to criticize the very relevance of efficient markets. For instance, Grossman and Stiglitz [11] argued that because information</p>",

Moreover, this theory is not empirically refutable (since a test of the random character of stock prices does not imply a test on efficiency). Nevertheless, financial economists have considered EMH as one of the pillars of financial economics because it played a key role in the creation and history of financial economics by linking financial results with standard economics.
