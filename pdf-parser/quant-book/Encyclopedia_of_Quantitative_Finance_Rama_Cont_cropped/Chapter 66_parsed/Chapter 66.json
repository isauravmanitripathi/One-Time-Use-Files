They typically have a number of characteristics that distinguish them from financial options; see [38] and [35] for overviews. There is usually an initial <i>vesting</i> period during which the options cannot be exercised. Cliff vesting is a structure where all options granted on a given date become exercisable after an initial period, usually 2–4 years. Stepped vesting refers to a structure where a proportion of an option grant becomes exercisable each year, for example, 10% after one year, then 20%, 30%, and 40% each subsequent year. The most common structure is straight vesting where the proportions are equal, say one-third of the grant is exercisable after each of the first three years (see [2, 30], and [25]). During this period, typically, the employee must forfeit the remaining unvested options if he or she resigned or is fired. Clearly, if there is no vesting period, the options are American style, whereas, in the limit, as the vesting period approaches maturity, the options become European (<i>see</i> <b>American</b> <b>Options</b>; <b>Call Options</b> for descriptions of European and American options).</p>",

The length of time is generally longest if the employee retires and shortest if the employee leaves or is fired.

Huddart and Lang [23] study exercise behavior in a sample of eight firms that volunteered internal records on option grants and exercises from 1982 to 1994. They find a pervasive pattern of option exercises well before expiration–the mean fraction of option life elapsed at the time of exercise varied from 0.26 to 0.79 over companies. Bettis <i>et al.</i> [2] analyze a unique database of more than 140 000 option exercises by corporate executives at almost 4000 firms during the period 1996 through 2002. They find 10-year options were exercised a median of 4.25 years before expiry. A further feature documented in the data is that of block exercise. Huddart and Lang [23] find that the mean fraction of options from a single grant exercised by an employee at one time varied from 0.18 to 0.72 over employees at a number of companies. Similarly, Aboody [1] reports yearly mean percentages of options exercised over the life of 5 and 10 year options, showing exercises are spread over the life of the options. Some of these block exercises are due to the nature of the vesting structure– for instance, Huddart and Lang [23] find spikes on vest dates corresponding to large exercises on those dates–but there are also other block exercises on dates that cannot be explained by vesting.</p>",

In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) set a standard to require firms to expense stock options using \"fair value\". However, this included the possibility to calculate the option cost to the firm as the option's intrinsic value at the grant date. Perhaps motivated by this, companies mainly granted options that were at-themoney thus calculating a zero value for the expense. The huge growth of employee options and a series of corporate scandals led to pressure for changes to these rules, and new regulations (FASB 123R in the United States, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 2 in Europe) were introduced in 2004. From 2005 onward, these regulations required companies to use a \"fair value method\" of accounting for the expense of employee options, and although recommendations are made concerning appropriate methods, there is still much scope for interpretation by companies. For instance, use of the (European) Black–Scholes price with an estimated \"expected term\" is an acceptable and popular approach. Despite these changes, the granting of options that are at-themoney is still typical.</p>",

In such models, it is straightforward to show that, in the limit, as the (absolute value of) correlation between the company stock and market approaches one, the Black–Scholes or complete market value is recovered. This value is then an upper bound on the utility-based valuation. In a European option setting, the Black–Scholes value represents the cost to the company, so we see the value to the employee is lower than the cost to the company. The other comparison of interest is to consider what difference the ability to undertake partial hedging in the market makes. The ability to partially hedge is valuable to the employee and his or her utility-based or subjective option value is higher than without the hedging/investment opportunity. In other words, the subjective value increases in (absolute value of) correlation.

The exercise threshold and option values both decrease with risk aversion and increase with (absolute value of) correlation. Just as in the European case, the ability to partially hedge risk is valuable to the employee. He or she places a higher value on the option and waits longer to exercise it. It is also possible that stock volatility reduces the option value in some scenarios because of the interaction of the convex payoff with the concave utility function; see [17, 18, 33], and also [37]. Since the cost to the company is just the risk-neutral option value conditional on optimal exercise by the employee, it is also decreasing with risk aversion and increasing with (absolute value of) correlation [13]. Detemple and Sundaresan [9] and Ingersoll [25] also allow for optimal investment in a market portfolio and consider numerical approaches to the marginal pricing of small quantities of options.</p>",

Consideration of models that only allow for one option or one exercise time is not consistent with this observation. Vesting is one feature that clearly encourages such block exercise behavior, and indeed, Huddart and Lang [23] observe that many exercises take place immediately when the options vest. However, vesting does not appear to explain all of the intertemporal exercises, since not all exercises occur immediately upon vesting. Another reason for intertemporal exercise is risk aversion and the inability to hedge risk due to restrictions. Jain and Subrahmanian [26] consider a binomial model for a risk-averse employee who is granted a number of options. Grasselli [12] extends the binomial framework to include optimal investment in a correlated market asset. These papers find numerically that optimal behavior is to exercise options when the stock price reaches a boundary and the discrete nature of the model results in exercise occurring at a discrete set of dates or stock price levels. Rogers and Scheinkman [36] make similar observations numerically in a discrete approximation to a continuous-time model without investment opportunities in a market asset.</p>",

These thresholds are obtained using a recursive relation. The price thresholds are increasing as the quantity of options falls. In other words, when the employee has fewer options remaining, he or she is exposed to less risk, and thus is willing to wait for a higher price threshold before exercising further options. Similar comparative statics apply as in the single American option case–thresholds, option values, and company cost are decreasing in risk aversion and increasing in (absolute value of) correlation. In addition, they show that the cost to the company is underestimated if a single optimal exercise threshold is used. Since, in reality, options are not exercised one at a time, the paper also introduces a transaction cost on exercise, which restores block exercise as the optimal solution, again found in closed form.
