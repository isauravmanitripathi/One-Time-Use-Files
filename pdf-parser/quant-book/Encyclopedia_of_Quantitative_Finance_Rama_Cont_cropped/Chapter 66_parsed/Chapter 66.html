    Employee Stock Options
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Employee stock options (ESOs) are call options issued by a company and given to its employees as part of their remuneration. The rationale is that granting the employee options will align his or her interests with those of the firm's shareholders. This is particularly relevant for managers and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) whose behavior has more impact on firm value than that of lower ranked employees.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   ESOs are prevalent in both the United States and Europe. In the fiscal year 1999, 94% of the S&amp;P 500 companies granted options to their top executives, and the value at the grant date represented 47% of total pay for the CEOs [14]. The 2005 Mercer Compensation Survey [34] reports that over 75% of CEOs receive option grants and options account for 32% of CEO pay. The Hay Group's 2006 European Executive Pay Survey [15] found that 55% of the companies in the study used stock options.

   ESOs are American call options on the company stock granted to the employee. They typically have a number of characteristics that distinguish them from financial options; see [38] and [35] for overviews. There is usually an initial
   <i>
    vesting
   </i>
   period during which the options cannot be exercised. Cliff vesting is a structure where all options granted on a given date become exercisable after an initial period, usually 2–4 years. Stepped vesting refers to a structure where a proportion of an option grant becomes exercisable each year, for example, 10% after one year, then 20%, 30%, and 40% each subsequent year. The most common structure is straight vesting where the proportions are equal, say one-third of the grant is exercisable after each of the first three years (see [2, 30], and [25]). During this period, typically, the employee must forfeit the remaining unvested options if he or she resigned or is fired. Clearly, if there is no vesting period, the options are American style, whereas, in the limit, as the vesting period approaches maturity, the options become European (

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   After the vesting period, the options may be exercised at any time up to and including the maturity date. These options are typically long dated with a 10-year maturity being most common. The employee
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   is not able to sell or transfer the options at any time. This is in keeping with the alignment or incentive effect of options. The option terms are modified if the employee exits the firm either because he or she is fired, leaves, retires, or dies. These "sunset rules" vary widely across firms (see [8] for details), but typically the employee is given a period of time in which to exercise the options or forfeit them. The length of time is generally longest if the employee retires and shortest if the employee leaves or is fired. In addition to being unable to unwind an option position by selling it, employees are typically also restricted from short selling the stock of their company and thus are very restricted in terms of hedging their option exposure [5].

   There have been a number of empirical studies of ESO exercise patterns. Huddart and Lang [23] study exercise behavior in a sample of eight firms that volunteered internal records on option grants and exercises from 1982 to 1994. They find a pervasive pattern of option exercises well before expiration–the mean fraction of option life elapsed at the time of exercise varied from 0.26 to 0.79 over companies. Bettis
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [2] analyze a unique database of more than 140 000 option exercises by corporate executives at almost 4000 firms during the period 1996 through 2002. They find 10-year options were exercised a median of 4.25 years before expiry. A further feature documented in the data is that of block exercise. Huddart and Lang [23] find that the mean fraction of options from a single grant exercised by an employee at one time varied from 0.18 to 0.72 over employees at a number of companies. Similarly, Aboody [1] reports yearly mean percentages of options exercised over the life of 5 and 10 year options, showing exercises are spread over the life of the options. Some of these block exercises are due to the nature of the vesting structure– for instance, Huddart and Lang [23] find spikes on vest dates corresponding to large exercises on those dates–but there are also other block exercises on dates that cannot be explained by vesting.

   There are many questions of interest–including "What is the employee's optimal exercise policy?", "What are the options worth to him or her?"; "What is the corresponding cost to the company of granting the options?" The employee's exercise policy and option value should incorporate the features described above–his or her inability to hedge being key. The cost to the company should reflect the
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   value of the option liability to the issuing corporation. This usually entails the assumption that shareholders are well diversified, so the cost should be the risk-neutral option value conditional on the optimal exercise behavior of the employee. This distinction between the option value to the employee (often called
   <i>
    subjective value
   </i>
   ) and the cost to the company is important and arises because the employee cannot perfectly hedge the risk of the option exposure, while shareholders are typically assumed to be well diversified.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The need to quantify the company cost is particularly relevant in light of changes in accounting rules, which require companies to expense options at the grant date. In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) set a standard to require firms to expense stock options using "fair value". However, this included the possibility to calculate the option cost to the firm as the option's intrinsic value at the grant date. Perhaps motivated by this, companies mainly granted options that were at-themoney thus calculating a zero value for the expense. The huge growth of employee options and a series of corporate scandals led to pressure for changes to these rules, and new regulations (FASB 123R in the United States, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 2 in Europe) were introduced in 2004. From 2005 onward, these regulations required companies to use a "fair value method" of accounting for the expense of employee options, and although recommendations are made concerning appropriate methods, there is still much scope for interpretation by companies. For instance, use of the (European) Black–Scholes price with an estimated "expected term" is an acceptable and popular approach. Despite these changes, the granting of options that are at-themoney is still typical.

   To take into account the nonhedgability aspect of employee options, we need to move outside of the complete market or risk-neutral pricing framework to an incomplete setting (

   <b>
    Complete Markets
   </b>
   ). There have been many papers in the literature in this direction, beginning with [22, 31, 32], and [14], amongst others. These papers typically develop binomial models that take trading restrictions and employee risk aversion into account and compute a certainty equivalent or subjective value for the employee options. These models make the simplistic assumption that any nonoption wealth is invested in a riskless bank account, and most treat the options as
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   European. Also in a binomial model, Cai and Vijh [3] and Carpenter [5] assume nonoption or outside wealth is invested in a Merton-style portfolio, but only allow for a one-off choice of this portfolio.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Many of the papers mentioned above observe that the utility-based or subjective valuation to the employee is much lower than the equivalent Black–Scholes value (the value obtained in an equivalent complete market setting); however, this is not universally true in models where nonoption wealth is invested in a riskless bond [14]. Generally, however, the (subjective) value of the options to the employee is less than the cost of the options to the company because of the employee's hedging restrictions.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   These models have been extended to incorporate the impact of optimal investment of outside wealth in a market or risky asset, rather than just a bank account. This was tackled in the natural setting of utility-indifference pricing (see [19] for a survey containing many references) for European options by Henderson [17]. This allows the employee to reduce risk by partial hedging in the market asset, which would seem to reflect what can be done in practice. The basic setup for continuous-time models with hedging in the market asset is as follows. The market

   . In such models, it is straightforward to show that, in the limit, as the (absolute value of) correlation between the company stock and market approaches one, the Black–Scholes or complete market value is recovered. This value is then an upper bound on the utility-based valuation. In a European option setting, the Black–Scholes value represents the cost to the company, so we see the value to the employee is lower than the cost to the company. The other comparison of interest is to consider what difference the ability to undertake partial hedging in the market makes. The ability to partially hedge is valuable to the employee and his or her utility-based or subjective option value is higher than without the hedging/investment opportunity. In other words, the subjective value increases in (absolute value of) correlation. Similar to the models without the market asset, the higher the employee's risk aversion, the lower the utility-based option value.

   Of course, as we described earlier, employee stock options are American options, and allow for early exercise once the options have vested. Some of the aforementioned papers also treat American style options and the general intuition is that hedging restrictions of the employee result in an earlier exercise and a lower subjective value than the equivalent Black–Scholes (complete market) American option. In the continuous-time model with investment in the market asset, closed-form results are found under the assumptions of exponential utility and perpetual options in [18] and numerical solutions for finite maturity in [33].

   considered the case of the perpetual option but without the partial hedging in the market. The exercise threshold and option values both decrease with risk aversion and increase with (absolute value of) correlation. Just as in the European case, the ability to partially hedge risk is valuable to the employee. He or she places a higher value on the option and waits longer to exercise it. It is also possible that stock volatility reduces the option value in some scenarios because of the interaction of the convex payoff with the concave utility function; see [17, 18, 33], and also [37]. Since the cost to the company is just the risk-neutral option value conditional on optimal exercise by the employee, it is also decreasing with risk aversion and increasing with (absolute value of) correlation [13]. Detemple and Sundaresan [9] and Ingersoll [25] also allow for optimal investment in a market portfolio and consider numerical approaches to the marginal pricing of small quantities of options.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As mentioned earlier, the data indicates that employees exercise options in a number of tranches on different occasions. Consideration of models that only allow for one option or one exercise time is not consistent with this observation. Vesting is one feature that clearly encourages such block exercise behavior, and indeed, Huddart and Lang [23] observe that many exercises take place immediately when the options vest. However, vesting does not appear to explain all of the intertemporal exercises, since not all exercises occur immediately upon vesting. Another reason for intertemporal exercise is risk aversion and the inability to hedge risk due to restrictions. Jain and Subrahmanian [26] consider a binomial model for a risk-averse employee who is granted a number of options. Grasselli [12] extends the binomial framework to include optimal investment in a correlated market asset. These papers find numerically that optimal behavior is to exercise options when the stock price reaches a boundary and the discrete nature of the model results in exercise occurring at a discrete set of dates or stock price levels. Rogers and Scheinkman [36] make similar observations numerically in a discrete approximation to a continuous-time model without investment opportunities in a market asset.

   Grasselli and Henderson [13] show that under the assumption of exponential utility and perpetual options, closed-form solutions can be derived for the multiple-option problem with investment opportunities in a market asset. In fact, they show that

  <p block-type="Text">
   given
   <i>
    N
   </i>
   options, there are
   <i>
    N
   </i>
   unique stock price thresholds at which the employee should exercise an option. These thresholds are obtained using a recursive relation. The price thresholds are increasing as the quantity of options falls. In other words, when the employee has fewer options remaining, he or she is exposed to less risk, and thus is willing to wait for a higher price threshold before exercising further options. Similar comparative statics apply as in the single American option case–thresholds, option values, and company cost are decreasing in risk aversion and increasing in (absolute value of) correlation. In addition, they show that the cost to the company is underestimated if a single optimal exercise threshold is used. Since, in reality, options are not exercised one at a time, the paper also introduces a transaction cost on exercise, which restores block exercise as the optimal solution, again found in closed form. Leung and Sircar [33] consider the finite-maturity version of the problem, which leads to numerical solution of the free-boundary problem. They also include features such as vesting and job termination risk.

  <p block-type="Text">
   As described earlier, option terms change upon departure of an employee from the company and this should be incorporated into pricing models. Employee departure is typically modeled by an exogenous exponentially distributed time with constant intensity, independent of the stock price, similar to a reduced-form approach in credit modeling. (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Structural Default Risk Models
   </b>
   ). The papers [5, 6, 27, 39], and [33], among others, incorporate departure into a variety of setups in this manner.

   [2] and Carpenter [5] have attempted calibration exercises on utility style models to exercise data; however, many simplifying assumptions have to be made due to data limitations. For example, they assume an option grant is exercised on one date only rather than on multiple occasions. Perhaps surprising is the finding of Carpenter [5] that after a calibration to data, a reduced-form model of employee departure is as capable as a utility-maximizing model in explaining option exercises. This finding motivates another strand of the literature, which models option exercise exogenously by postulating an exercise boundary in terms of the moneyness of the
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   option; see [24] and [7]. This style of model has the attraction of simplicity and is much easier for calibration since the employee's risk aversion is no longer used. For this reason, it may well be a fruitful approach for calculating an approximation to the cost of the options to the company for accounting purposes.

   We now turn to briefly discuss a number of other features relevant in employee compensation. Typically employees receive new grants of options periodically; however, companies also engage in resetting (where the option strike of existing options is adjusted downward when the options are out-ofthe-money) and reloading (where additional options are granted automatically when existing options are exercised [10]).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Besides the traditional employee options described in this article, companies have increasingly granted performance-based options, which link option vesting or exercise to the achievement of market or accounting-based performance targets. These options are very popular in Europe, but have, until recently, been less common in the United States; see [11] and references therein. Compensation linked to accounting data is potentially open to manipulation and managers with such options may be motivated to inflate earnings. There is a large literature on the connection between compensation involving accounting-based targets and earnings management, either of a direct nature [4]) or accrual-based management or manipulation Healy [16].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Performance-based options can also have exercise prices contingent on performance relative to a comparison group–these are known as indexed options; see Johnson and Tian [28] who value such options in a risk-neutral framework using techniques from exchange or Margrabe options (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Margrabe Formula
   </b>
   ). Managers are then rewarded as a function of relative performance relative to a peer group rather than on absolute performance [20].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Other important issues that have not been discussed here include the impact of dilution–when options are exercised, the company typically issues new shares. Another important issue is the influence the CEO has on the stock price
   <i>
    via
   </i>
   his or her effort or choice of projects/risk. The problem of how best to compensate managers, given the benefits of improved incentives and the costs of inefficient risk-sharing, is the subject of a large literature on the principal agent problem; see the classic reference [21].
