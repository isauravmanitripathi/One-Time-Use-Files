    Regime-switching Models
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Many financial time series exhibit sudden changes in the structure of the data-generating process. Examples include financial crises, exchange rate swings, and jumps in the volatility. Sometimes, this sudden switch is due to a change in policy, for example, when moving from a fixed to a floating exchange rate regime. In other cases, the behavior of the series is influenced by an exogenous fundamental variable, such as the current position on the business or the credit cycle.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Regime-switching models attempt to capture this behavior by allowing the data-generating process to change in time, depending on an underlying, discrete but unobserved state variable. Typically, the functional form of the data-generating process remains the same across the different regimes with only the parameter values being state-dependent, as, for example, in a random walk equity return model where the drift and volatility change with the regime. However, it is feasible to set up models where the data-generating process itself changes, for example, moving from a deterministic fixed exchange to a stochastic floating one.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   From a statistical point of view, regime-switching models will produce mixtures of distributions (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Mixture of Distribution Hypothesis
   </b>
   ), offering a very stylized and intuitive way of accommodating features such as fat tails, skewness, and volatility clustering (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Stylized Properties of Asset Returns
   </b>
   ). It is very easy to calibrate regimeswitching models on historical data using maximum likelihood techniques, implementing what can be thought of as a discrete version of the Kalman filter (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Filtering
   </b>
   ). Virtually all economic and financial time series have been analyzed under the regime-switching framework, including interest and exchange rates, equity returns, commodity prices, energy prices, and credit spreads.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Derivative prices can be computed for regimeswitching models by using transform methods (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Hazard Rate
   </b>
   ). The characteristic function of a regime-switching process can be computed in closed form if the characteristic functions conditional on each regime are available. This makes such processes a viable alternative to the stochastic volatility models, where one has to also resort to transform methods for pricing.

    The Regime-switching Framework
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A regime-switching model can be cast in either a discrete or continuous time setting. The model is built conditional to a Markov chain
   <i>
    s(t)
   </i>
   , the realization of which is not directly observed by economic agents. The chain can take a discrete set of values, and here we label them as
   <i>
    s(t)
   </i>
   ∈ {1
   <i>
    ,
   </i>
   2
   <i>
    ,...,N
   </i>
   } =
   <i>
    S
   </i>
   . The Markov chain is determined by its transition probability matrix in discrete time or its rate matrix in continuous time. In particular, in a discrete time setting, we write the transition probabilities
   <i>
    pi,j
   </i>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    P[S(t+1) = j | S(t) = i] = p_{i,j} \tag{1}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   and we collect the elements {
   <i>
    pi,j
   </i>
   } in the transition probability matrix
   <b>
    P
   </b>
   . The columns of
   <b>
    P
   </b>
   must sum up to 1, and all transition probabilities must be nonnegative. For a continuous time process, we define the transition rates
   <i>
    qi,j
   </i>
   :
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    P[S(t + dt) = j | S(t) = i] = \mathbf{1}(i = j) + q_{i,j}dt \quad (2)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where
   <b>
    1
   </b>
   is the indicator function. The elements {
   <i>
    qi,j
   </i>
   } are collected in the rate matrix
   <b>
    Q
   </b>
   . Note that by this definition, the columns of the rate matrix must sum up to 0, and the diagonal elements will be negative. The infinitesimal transition probability matrix is given as
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \mathbf{P}(\mathrm{d}t) = \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{Q}\mathrm{d}t \tag{3}

  <p block-type="Text">
   At each point in time, the data-generating process will vary, according to the regime
   <i>
    s(t)
   </i>
   that prevails at that time. Thus, for a discrete time process, we can write
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">

   <i>
    x(t)

   , and

A small sample of the vast number of empirical applications that utilize the regime-switching framework is provided in [3, 15, 17, 19, 23, 27]. Generalizations include time-varying transition probabilities that depend on explanatory variables [14], switching generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic (GARCH)-type processes [16, 20], and models that resemble a multifractal setting [6]. A Bayesian alternative to maximum likelihood is sought in [1].

   The above prototypical process can be extended in two directions. Rather than having switching Brownian motions that generate the conditional paths, one can consider switching Lévy processes (see Lévy

   Pricing of American options can be done by setting up the continuation region

More exotic products can be handled by setting up a system of partial (integro-)differential equations (see Partial Integro-differential Equations (PIDEs)) or by explicitly using Fourier methods as in [22]. As the conditional distribution can be recovered from the characteristic function numerically, the density-based approach of [2] (see
   <b>
    Quadrature Methods
   </b>
   ) can be a viable alternative.

    Regime Switching as an Approximation
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Rather than serving as the fundamental latent process, the Markov chain can serve as an approximation to more complex jump-diffusive dynamics. Then, one can use the regime-switching framework to tackle problem in a nonaffine (see Affine Models) setting, both in terms of calibration and derivative pricing. To achieve that, the number of regimes must be large, but the transition rates and conditional dynamics will be functions of a small number of parameters. The book by Kushner and Dupuis [25] outlines the convergence conditions for the approximation of generic diffusions and shows how one can implement the Markov chain approximation in practice.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Following this approach, many stochastic volatility problems can be cast as regime-switching ones. Chourdakis [8] shows how a generic stochastic volatility process can be approximated in that way, whereas Chourdakis [9] extends this method to produce the counterpart of the [21] stochastic volatility model (see Heston Model) in a regime-switching framework where the equity is driven by a Lévy noise.
