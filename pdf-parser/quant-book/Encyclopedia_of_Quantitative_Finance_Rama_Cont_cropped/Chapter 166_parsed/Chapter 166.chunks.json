Traditional credit management was, to a large extent, focused on the stand-alone analysis and monitoring of the credit quality of obligors or counterparties. Frequently, the credit process did also include <i>ad hoc</i> exposure-based limit-setting policies that were devised in order to prevent excessive risk concentrations. This approach was scrutinized in the 1990s, when the financial industry started to realize that univariate models for obligor default had to be extended to a portfolio context. It was recognized that credit rating and loss recovery models, although a crucial element in the assessment of credit risk, fail to explain some of the important stylized facts of credit loss distributions, if the stochastic dependence of obligor defaults is neglected. From a statistical point of view, not only the skewness and the relatively heavy upper tails of credit portfolio loss distributions, but also the historically observed variation of default rates and the clustering of bankruptcies in single sectors are clearly inconsistent with stochastic independence of defaults. From an economics point of view, it is plausible that default rates are connected to the intrinsic fluctuations of business cycles; relationships between default rates and the economic environment have indeed been established in numerous empirical studies [5]. All these insights supported the quest for tractable credit portfolio models that reflect these stylized facts.</p>",

In contrast to a univariate approach, a credit portfolio framework allows to quantify the diversification effects between credit instruments. This makes it, for example, possible to evaluate the impact on the total risk when securities are added or removed from a portfolio. In the same vein, the risk numbers produced by a portfolio model help to identify possible hedges. Ultimately, the use of a portfolio model facilitates the active management of credit portfolios and the efficient allocation of capital. Less of a pure risk management matter is the use of portfolio models for risk-adjusted pricing</p>",

The total portfolio risk is commonly considered as a capital which the lender should hold in order to buffer large losses. For nontraded assets, such as loans or mortgages, the costs for holding this risk capital are typically transferred to the borrowers by means of a surcharge on interest rates. Calculating these surcharges necessitates that the total portfolio risk capital is broken down to borrower (or instrument) level risk contributions. Only in a portfolio model framework, where the dependence between obligors and the resulting diversification benefits are correctly captured, this risk contribution can be determined in an economically rational and fair fashion. We mention that risk contributions can also be applied in order to determine the <i>ex post</i> (historical) riskadjusted performance of instruments or subportfolios. Credit portfolio models also play an important role in the pricing of credit derivatives or structured products, such as credit default swaps or CDSs. For the correct pricing of many of these credit instruments, it is crucial that the dependence between obligor default times are well modeled.</p>",

Morgan and cosponsors from the financial industry published a comprehensive technical document [13] on CreditMetrics, in an effort to set industry standards and to create more transparency in credit risk management. This publication attracted a lot of attention and proved to stimulate research in credit risk. To this date, the CreditMetrics or derivations thereof have been implemented by a large number of financial institutions. Before we turn to a detailed description of CreditMetrics, it might be worth to mention two related models. CreditPortfolioView by McKinsey &amp; Co is creditmigration-based as well. However, in contrast to CreditMetrics, which assumes temporally constant transition matrices, it is endowed with an estimator of credit migration probabilities based on macroeconomic observables. is dedicated to its discussion.</p>",

In both CreditMetrics and KMV, the obligor correlation is generated in a similar fashion, that is, with a dependence structure following a Gaussian copula. The main differences concern the number of credit states and the source of probabilities of default (PDs). The KMV model operates on a continuum of states, namely, the so-called expected default frequencies (Moody's KMV EDF&lt;sup&gt;™c&lt;/sup&gt;), basically estimated PDs, whereas CreditMetrics is restricted to a finite number of credit rating states. For this reason, KMV is strictly spoken not a credit-migration-based model and therefore only touched in this article. As remarked by McNeil et al. [19], a discretization of EDF would translate KMV to a model which, apart from parametrization, is structurally equivalent to CreditMetrics. Secondly, while for Credit-Metrics rating transition matrices are the required exogenous inputs, the KMV counterparts, EDF of listed companies, are estimated through a proprietary method, which is basically an extension of the celebrated Merton model [20] for firm default. Inputs to the EDF model are historical time-series of equity prices together with company debt information, with which the unobserved asset value processes are reconstructed and a quantity called <i>distance</i> to <i>default</i> <math display=\"inline\">(DD)</math> is calculated for every firm. This DD is used as a predictor of EDF; the relationship is determined by a nonlinear regression of historical default data against historical DD values. It is beyond the scope of this article to provide more details and so we refer to [2] or [17] for an account of the EDF methodology.</p>",

In order to capture the obligor dependence structure. CreditMetrics borrows ideas from the Merton structural model for firm default, which links default to the obligor asset value falling short of its liabilities. The assumption of CreditMetrics is that the obligor rating transition is caused by changes of the obligor's asset value, or equivalently, the asset value return. The lower this random return, the lower the new rating; if the asset value return drops below a certain threshold, default occurs. Mathematically, this amounts to defining return buckets for each obligor; the thresholds bounding these buckets depend on the initial obligor rating, the transition probabilities, and the return distribution. The rating of an obligor is determined by the bucket its return falls into. Obviously, the bucket probabilities must coincide with the transition probabilities. Models of this type are also called <i>threshold models</i>.</p>",
