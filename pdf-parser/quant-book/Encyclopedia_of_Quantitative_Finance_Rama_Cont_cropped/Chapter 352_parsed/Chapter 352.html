    Stochastic Volatility

   Models
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The Black-Scholes model (see Black-Scholes For
   <b>
    mula
   </b>
   ) rests upon a number of assumptions that are, to some extent, "counterfactual". Among these are continuity in time of the asset price process (they do not jump), the ability to hedge continuously without transaction costs, independent Gaussian returns, and constant volatility. Stochastic volatility models relax the last assumption by allowing volatility to be randomly varying; this is motivated by the following reason: the dependence of Black-Scholes implied volatilities computed from market prices of call and put options, known as the smile curve (see Implied Volatility Surface), is accounted for by stochastic volatility models. In other words, this modification of the Black-Scholes theory succeeds in one area where the classical model fails. In fact, it has been shown
   <math display="inline">
    [18, 23]
   </math>
   that any randomness in volatility produces a smile of implied volatilities. Empirical evidence for the smile curve of implied volatility appears in many studies, including [20], using data from before the 1987 crash, and in [16], where the postcrash skew is documented (see Implied Volatility Surface). Early work on fitting an implied volatility surface, includes [1], and [4, 6, 21]. An extensive empirical study of the stability of the fitted surfaces can be found in [5].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In fact, modeling volatility as a stochastic process is motivated
   <i>
    a priori
   </i>
   by empirical studies of stock price returns in which estimated volatility is observed to exhibit "random" characteristics. Additionally, the effects of transaction costs show up, under many models, as uncertainty in the volatility; fat-tailed returns distributions can be simulated by stochastic volatility; market "jump" phenomena are often best modeled as volatility jump processes. Stochastic volatility modeling is therefore more than a simple fix to one particular Black-Scholes assumption, but rather a powerful modification that describes a much more complex market.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Pricing derivatives in a market with stochastic volatility is an incomplete markets problem, a distinction explained below, and one which has far-reaching consequences, particularly for the hedging problem and the problem of parameter estimation. It is the
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   latter inverse problem that is the biggest mathematical and practical challenge introduced by such models.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Early surveys can be found in [9, 11], or [14], and books on stochastic volatility are also available [7, 17], and [10].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In most stochastic volatility models, the asset price
   <math display="inline">
    (X_t)_{t\geq 0}
   </math>
   satisfies the stochastic differential equation
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    dX_t = \mu X_t dt + \sigma_t X_t dW_t \tag{1}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    (\sigma_t)_{t&gt;0}
   </math>
   is called the volatility process. It must satisfy some regularity conditions for the model to be well defined, but it does not have to be an Itô process: it can be a jump process, a Markov chain, and so on. In order for it to be a volatility, it should be positive. Unlike the implied deterministic volatility models (see Local Volatility Model), the volatility process is
   <i>
    not
   </i>
   perfectly correlated with the Brownian motion
   <math display="inline">
    (W_t)
   </math>
   . Therefore, volatility is modeled to have an independent random component of its own. This leads to an incomplete market, that is, derivatives cannot, in general, be perfectly hedged by trading the underlying asset and money market only. In fact, there is no
   <i>
    unique
   </i>
   equivalent martingale measure.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Mean-reverting Stochastic Volatility Models
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Typically, volatility is taken to be an Itô process satisfying a stochastic differential equation driven by a second Brownian motion. This is the easiest way to incorporate correlation with stock price changes. One desirable feature is
   <i>
    mean reversion
   </i>
   . The term itmean reverting refers to the characteristic (typical) time it takes for a process to get back to the mean level of its invariant distribution (the long-run distribution of the process) and "forget" about its past. From a financial modeling perspective, mean reverting refers to a linear pull-back term in the drift of the volatility process itself, or in the drift of some (underlying) process of which volatility is a function. Let us denote
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_t = f(Y_t)
   </math>
   where f is some positive function. Then mean-reverting stochastic volatility means that the stochastic differential equation for
   <math display="inline">
    (Y_t)
   </math>
   has the following form:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    dY_t = \alpha (m - Y_t) dt + \cdots d\hat{Z}_t \tag{2}
   </math>

   where
   <math display="inline">
    (\hat{Z}_t)_{t\geq 0}
   </math>
   is a Brownian motion correlated with

   </math>
   :
   <math display="inline">

   , and there are economic arguments for a negative correlation or

   </i>
   between stock price and volatility shocks. From common experience and empirical studies, when volatility goes up, asset prices tend to go down. Some common driving processes

   Classical references investigating specific stochastic volatility models are [2, 13, 15, 22, 24], and [25]. These particular models are chosen for their nice properties (e.g., positivity and mean reversion) and analytical tractability, rather than from deeper financial reasons. The Heston model is very popular for its computational tractability.

   Probability density functions of the stock price obtained from simulations exhibit fatter tails because of the random volatility. In particular, the negative correlation causes the tails to be asymmetric: the left tail is fatter.
