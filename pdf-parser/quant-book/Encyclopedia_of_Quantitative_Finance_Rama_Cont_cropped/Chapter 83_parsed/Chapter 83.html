  <p block-type="Text">
   A financial
   <i>
    option
   </i>
   is a contract conferring on the holder the right, but not the obligation, to engage in some transaction, on precisely specified terms, at some time in the future. When the holder does decide to engage in the transaction, he/she is said to
   <i>
    exercise the option
   </i>
   . There are two parties to an option contract, generally known as the
   <i>
    writer
   </i>
   and the
   <i>
    buyer
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    holder
   </i>
   . The "optionality" accrues to the buyer; the writer has the obligation to carry out his/her side of the transaction, should the buyer exercise the option. An option is
   <i>
    vulnerable
   </i>
   if there is considered to be nonnegligible risk that the writer will fail to do this, that is, he/she will default on his/her side of the contract.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The classic contracts are European call and put options. A
   <b>
    call option
   </b>
   entitles the holder to purchase a specified number
   <i>
    N
   </i>
   of units of a security at a fixed price
   <i>
    K
   </i>
   per unit, at a specified time
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   . If
   <i>
    ST
   </i>
   is the market price of the security at time
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   , the holder will exercise the option if and only if
   <i>
    ST &gt; K
   </i>
   (otherwise, it would be cheaper to buy in the market). Since the holder has now acquired for
   <i>
    K
   </i>
   per unit something that is worth
   <i>
    ST
   </i>
   , he/she makes a profit of
   <i>
    N (ST
   </i>
   −
   <i>
    K)
   </i>
   . Thus, in general, the profit is
   <i>
    N

   [

    sell

   at

   , is
   <i>

   . The asset on which the option is written is called the
   <i>
    underlying asset
   </i>
   . A call option is
   <i>
    in the money
   </i>
   if
   <i>
    ST &gt; K
   </i>
   ,
   <i>
    at the money

   (

    ATM

   ) if
   <i>
    ST

   =
   <i>
    K
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    out of the money
   </i>
   if
   <i>
    ST &lt; K
   </i>
   . These terms are also used at earlier times
   <i>
    t&lt;T
   </i>
   (e.g., ATM if
   <i>
    St
   </i>
   =
   <i>

   etc.) even though the option cannot be exercised then. An option is
   <i>

    Option Contracts
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In general, several assets may underlie a given contract, as for example in an
   <b>
    exchange option
   </b>
   where the holder has the right to exchange one asset for another. Options are sometimes called
   <i>
    contingent claims
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    derivative securities
   </i>
   . These two synonymous terms include options, but refer more generally to any contract whose value is a function of the values of some collection of underlying assets.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   There are several binary classifications that help define an option contract.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <i>
    European/American
   </i>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   An option is European if it must be exercised, if at all, on a specified date, or a specified sequence of dates (for example, a
   <i>
    cap
   </i>
   is an
   <b>
    interest-rate option
   </b>
   consisting of a sequence of call options on the Libor rate; each of these options is exercised when they fall due if in the money). In an
   <b>
    American option
   </b>
   , by contrast, the time of exercise is at the holder's discretion. The classic American option involves a fixed final time
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   and allows the holder to exercise at any time
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   ≤
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   , leaving the holder with the problem of determining an exercise strategy that will maximize the value to him. This immediately implies three things: (i) the value of an American option that has not already been exercised at any time
   <i>
    t
   </i>
   can never be less than the
   <i>
    intrinsic value
   </i>
   ([
   <i>
    K
   </i>
   −
   <i>
    St
   </i>
   ]
   <sup>
    +
   </sup>
   for a put option), since one possible strategy is always to exercise
   <i>
    now
   </i>
   , (ii) the value can never be less than the value of the corresponding European option, since another possible strategy is never to exercise before
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   , and (iii) the value is a nondecreasing function of the final maturity time, since for
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   <sup>
    1
   </sup>
   <i>
    &lt; T
   </i>
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
   the
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   <sup>
    1
   </sup>
   option is just the
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
   option with the additional restriction that it never be exercised beyond
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   1. The difference between the American and European values for the same contract is called the
   <i>
    early exercise premium
   </i>
   . Sometimes, American options have some restriction on the set of allowable exercise times; for example, the conversion option in
   <b>
    convertible bonds
   </b>
   often prohibits the investor from converting before a certain minimum time. Of course, any such restrictions reduce the value since they reduce the class of exercise strategies. A particular case is the
   <i>
    Bermuda option
   </i>
   , which can only be exercised at one of a finite number of times. This is the normal situation in interest-rate options, where there is a natural sequence of
   <i>
    coupon dates
   </i>
   at which exercise decisions may be taken. Bermuda options are presumably so called because Bermuda is somewhere between America and Europe—but much closer to America.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <i>
    Traded/OTC
   </i>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Traded options are those where the parties trade through the medium of an organized exchange,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   while "over the counter" (OTC) options are bilateral agreements between market counterparties. Option exchanges have become increasingly globalized in recent years. They include the US–European consortium NYSE Euronext, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Eurex and EDX, all of which offer a range of financial contracts, and a number of specialist commodity exchanges such as NYMEX (oil), ICE, and the London Metal Exchange (LME). An exchange offers contracts on an underlying asset such as an individual stock or a stock index such as the S&amp;P500, with a range of maturity times and strike values. New options are added as the old ones roll off, and the strikes offered are in a range around the spot price of the underlying asset at the time the contract is initiated (the options may turn out to be far in or out of the money at later times, of course). In a traded options market, prices are determined by supply and demand. If the exercise times are
   <i>
    Ti
   </i>
   and the strike values
   <i>
    Kj
   </i>
   then the matrix
   <i>
    V
   </i>
   = [
   <i>
    σ
   </i>
   ˆ
   <i>
    ij
   </i>
   ], where
   <i>
    σ
   </i>
   ˆ
   <i>
    ij
   </i>
   is the
   <b>
    implied volatility
   </b>
   corresponding to the
   <i>
    (Ti, Kj )
   </i>
   contract, defines the so-called
   <b>
    volatility surface
   </b>
   that plays a key role in option risk management.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   All interest-rate options and most FX (foreign exchange) options are OTC, but many are, nevertheless, very liquidly traded and market information on implied volatilities is readily available.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <i>
    Physical Settlement/Cash Settlement
   </i>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Many single-stock options, and
   <b>
    commodity options
   </b>
   are
   <i>
    physically settled
   </i>
   , that is, at exercise the holder pays the strike value and takes delivery of a share certificate or a barrel of oil. (One can, however, avoid physical delivery by selling the option shortly before final maturity.) The alternative is
   <i>
    cash settlement
   </i>
   , where the holder is simply paid a cash amount, such as [
   <i>
    ST
   </i>
   −
   <i>
    K
   </i>
   ]
   <sup>
    +
   </sup>
   for a call option, at exercise. When the underlying is an index like the S&amp;P500 this is the only way—one cannot deliver the index! In this case, the amount paid is
   <i>
    c
   </i>
   × [
   <i>
    IT
   </i>
   −
   <i>
    K
   </i>
   ]
   <sup>
    +
   </sup>
   where
   <i>
    IT
   </i>
   is the value of the index and
   <i>
    c
   </i>
   is the contractually specified dollar value of one index point.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <i>
    Liquid/Illiquid
   </i>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Like any other traded asset, an option contract is
   <b>
    liquid
   </b>
   if there is large market depth, that is, there are a significant number of active traders in the market,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   none of whom controls a significant proportion of the total supply. In these circumstances, the price is well established, since the last trade was never very long ago; bid/ask spreads will be tight, buyers and sellers can enter the market at will, and there is little room for price manipulation. By contrast, in an illiquid market, it may be hard to establish a market price when actual trades are infrequent and bid/ask spreads are wide. The liquid/illiquid classification is not immutable: a liquid market can suddenly become illiquid if there is some shock that forces everybody onto the same side of the market. Several wellrecorded disasters in the derivatives market have been due to this phenomenon.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <i>
    (Plain) Vanilla/Exotic
   </i>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The simplest, most standard, and most widely traded options are often referred to as
   <i>
    plain vanilla
   </i>
   options. This would certainly include all exchange-traded options. An "exotic" option is an OTC option with nonstandard features of some kind, which requires significant modeling effort to value, and where different analysts could well come up with significantly different valuations. Exotic options often involve several underlying assets and complicated payment streams, but even a simple call option can be exotic if it poses significant hedging difficulties, as for example do long-dated equity options. On the other hand, barrier options, for example, which once would have been considered exotic, have now become vanilla in some markets such as FX, because they are so widely traded.
  </p>
  <h2>
   <i>
    Path-dependent/Path-independent
   </i>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An option is path-dependent if its exercise value depends on the value of the underlying asset at more than one time. Examples are barrier and Asian options, and any American option. The exercise value of a path-independent option is a function only of the underlying price, say
   <i>
    ST
   </i>
   , at the maturity time
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   , as for example in
   <b>
    Black–Scholes
   </b>
   . Valuation then only requires specifying the one-dimensional risk-neutral distribution of
   <i>
    ST
   </i>
   , whereas for a path-dependent option a distribution in path space is required, making the valuation more computationally intensive and model dependent.
  </p>

   <b>
    Option Definitions
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The purpose of this section is to collect together introductory definitions of various option contracts, or features of option contracts, found in the market. We refer to specialist articles in this encyclopaedia for a detailed treatment, and to standard textbooks such as Hull [1]. In these definitions, we use
   <math display="inline">
    S_t
   </math>
   to denote a generic underlying asset price, on which is written an option that starts at time 0 with final maturity at time
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <h4>
   Asian
  </h4>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   An Asian option is one whose exercise value depends on the
   <i>
    average price
   </i>
   over some range of times. Generally, this is an arithmetic average of the form
   <math display="inline">
    \overline{S} = (1/n) \sum_{i=1}^{n} S_{t_i}
   </math>
   and, of course, in reality, it is always a finite sum, although for purposes of analysis it is often convenient to consider continuous averaging
   <math display="inline">
    \overline{S}^c = (1/T) \int_0^T S_t dt
   </math>
   . Averaging may be over the entire length of the contract or some much shorter period. For example, in commodity options call option values are generally based on the 10day or one-month average price immediately prior to maturity, rather than on the spot price, to deter market manipulation.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Barrier
  </h4>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   A
   <b>
    barrier option
   </b>
   involves one or both of two prices, a lower barrier
   <math display="inline">
    L &lt; S_0
   </math>
   and an upper barrier
   <math display="inline">
    U &gt; S_0
   </math>
   , a strike
   <i>
    K
   </i>
   , and a maturity time
   <i>
    T
   </i>
   . Let
   <math display="inline">
    \tau_L = \inf\{t : S_t \leq
   </math>
   L},
   <math display="inline">
    \tau_U = \inf\{t : S_t \ge U\}
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    \tau_{LU} = \min(\tau_L, \tau_U)
   </math>
   . A knockout option expires worthless if a specified one of these times occurs before
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   , while a knockin option expires worthless unless this time occurs before
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   . An
   <i>
    up-and-out
   </i>
   call is a knockout call option based on
   <math display="inline">
    \tau_{U}
   </math>
   , so formally its exercise value is
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbf{1}_{(\tau_U&gt;T)}[S_T-K]^+
   </math>
   . Similarly, an up-and-in call has exercise value
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbf{1}_{(\tau_U \leq T)}[S_T - K]^+
   </math>
   . The sum is an ordinary call option. There are analogous definitions for down-and-out and down-and-in options based on
   <math display="inline">
    \tau_L
   </math>
   . Normally, these would be put options. A double barrier option knocks out or in at time
   <math display="inline">
    \tau_{LU}
   </math>
   . In the Black-Scholes model, there is an analytic formula for single-barrier options, based on the reflection principle for Brownian motion, but double barrier options require numerical methods.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Knockout options are cheaper than their plain vanilla counterparts because the exercise value is strictly less with positive probability. Essentially, the buyer of a vanilla option pays a premium for events he/she may regard as overwhelmingly unlikely. By buying a barrier option instead, he/she avoids paying this premium.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Basket
  </h3>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Consider a portfolio containing
   <math display="inline">
    w_i
   </math>
   units of asset
   <i>
    i
   </i>
   for
   <math display="inline">
    i = 1, \ldots, n
   </math>
   . A
   <b>
    basket
   </b>
   call option then has exercise value
   <math display="inline">
    [X - K]^+
   </math>
   where
   <math display="inline">
    X = \sum_i w_i S_i(T)
   </math>
   is the portfolio value at time
   <math display="inline">
    T

  </p>
  <h4>
   Bermuda
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   These were already mentioned above. Probably the most common example is the Bermuda swaption, entitling the holder to enter a swap at an agreed fixedside rate at any one of a list of coupon dates (or, equivalently, the right to walk away from an existing swap contract).
  </p>
  <h4>
   Chooser
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A chooser option involves three times 0,
   <math display="inline">
    T_1

   ,
   <math display="inline">
    T_2
   </math>
   , and a strike
   <math display="inline">
    K
   </math>
   . The option is entered and the strike set at time 0, and at time
   <math display="inline">
    T_1
   </math>
   , the holder selects whether it is to be a put or a call. The appropriate exercise value is then evaluated and paid at
   <math display="inline">
    T_2
   </math>
   . Thus the value at
   <math display="inline">
    T_1
   </math>
   is the maximum of the put and call values at that time. Given this fact valuation is straightforward in the Black-Scholes model.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Digital
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A digital option pays a fixed cash amount if some condition is realized. For example, an up-and-in digital barrier option with maturity

    T

   and barrier level U will pay a fixed amount X if
   <math display="inline">
    \tau_U &lt; T
