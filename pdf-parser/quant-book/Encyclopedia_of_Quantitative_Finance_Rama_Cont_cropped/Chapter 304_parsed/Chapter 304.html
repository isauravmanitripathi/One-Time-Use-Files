    Spectral Measures of Risk
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The term spectral measures of risk (SMRs) [1] denotes a subclass of coherent measures of risk (CMRs) [4] (see Convex Risk Measures) characterized by the additional properties of law invariance and comonotonic additivity, which make them particularly appropriate for financial risk management applications. In financial mathematics, this class was first defined in [1] and [7], which studied it from different perspectives. It was however soon realized that this class is in close correspondence with socalled distortion measures already introduced in 1996 in actuarial mathematics [9] in a different axiomatic framework from that of CMRs.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The most popular example of SMR is given by conditional Value at Risk/expected shortfall
   <math display="inline">
    (ES)
   </math>
   (see
   <b>
    Expected Shortfall
   </b>
   ), which is, in fact, the building block of all the class of SMRs as will be seen.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   An SMR of a random variable

    (r.v.)

   X denoted by

   sorted from the lowest to the highest, where
   <math display="inline">
    \phi

   is a weight function, called the risk spectrum of the SMR, which needs to be positive, normalized, and decreasing.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   In financial risk management, the SMR of a portfolio
   <math display="inline">

   usually means the SMR

   and a chosen future date

  <h2>
   Formal Definition of SMR
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   For the sake of simplicity, we overlook some technical details such as integrability of r.v.'s and continuity of risk measures. For a more detailed exposition, we refer to [6].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   SMRs can be defined as the most general convex combinations of all possible
   <math display="inline">
    ESs
   </math>
   . Let us consider a probability space with probability measure
   <math display="inline">
    P
   </math>
   and let X be an r.v. A generic SMR
   <math display="inline">
    \rho^{\mu}(X)
   </math>
   can therefore be uniquely written as
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \rho^{\mu}(X) = \int_0^1 ES_{\alpha}(X) \, \mathrm{d}\mu(\alpha) \tag{1}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    d\mu
   </math>
   is a measure on the interval [0, 1] and,
   <i>
    vice versa
   </i>
   , any such
   <math display="inline">
    d\mu
   </math>
   defines an SMR.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   For the sake of financial intuition, this expression can be recast into a mixture of quantiles of the variable X. Let
   <math display="inline">
    F_X^{-1}:(0,1) \to \mathbb{R}
   </math>
   denote an inverse function of the probability distribution function
   <math display="inline">
    F_X(x)
   </math>
   of X. Choose, for instance, the lower p-quantile function
   <math display="inline">
    F_X^{-1}(p) := q_p(X) =
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    \inf\{x \in \mathbb{R} | F_X(x) \ge p\}
   </math>
   . One can show that
   <math display="inline">
    \rho^{\mu} = \rho_{\phi}
   </math>
   with
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">

    \begin{aligned} \phi(p) &amp;= \mu(\{0\}) \,\delta_0(p) &amp; p &amp;= 0\\ \phi(p) &amp;= \int_{[p,1]} \mathrm{d}\mu(\alpha) \,\alpha^{-1} &amp; p \in (0,1] \end{aligned} \tag{3}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Alternatively, one can adopt equation
   <math display="inline">
    (2)
   </math>
   as a definition of SMR. The
   <i>
    risk spectrum
   </i>
   <math display="inline">
    \phi
   </math>
   must be of the form
   <math display="inline">
    \phi = c\delta_0(p) + \phi
   </math>
   with
   <math display="inline">
    c \in [0, 1]
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    \phi : [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}

  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   which can be shown to be necessary and sufficient for
   <math display="inline">
    \rho_{\phi}
   </math>
   in equation (2) to be a coherent measure of risk [1]. We see therefore that equation
   <math display="inline">
    (2)
   </math>
   can indeed be read as minus the
   <math display="inline">
    \phi
   </math>
   -weighted average of all the outcomes of X sorted in decreasing order, where
   <math display="inline">
    \phi
   </math>
   is a positive, normalized, and decreasing function. In general,
   <math display="inline">
    \phi
   </math>
   also admits a Dirac delta term
   <math display="inline">
    c\delta_0
   </math>
   in the origin, but the singular case
   <math display="inline">
    c \neq 0
   </math>
   is of no practical interest.

   <math display="inline">
    (2)

   tells us that a mixture of quantiles is coherent only when they are weighted in such a way that worse events
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   are given higher weights. This is an important lesson we learn when dealing with quantile-based measures of risk. We immediately also learn that for such a measure to be coherent it needs to weight all the left tail without neglecting any portion of its extreme values.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   If we consider
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha

   -Value at Risk
   <math display="inline">
    (V@R_{\alpha})

   (see Value-at-Risk), which is not a CMR (and hence not an SMR), we see that it can also be expressed through formula (2), but its risk spectrum turns out to be a Dirac delta
   <math display="inline">
    \phi^{V@R_{\alpha}}(p) = \delta_{\alpha}(p)
   </math>
   , which is clearly not decreasing on
   <math display="inline">
    [0, 1]
   </math>
   . Here, we see that the reason why
   <math display="inline">
    V@R
   </math>
   is not a CMR lies exactly in the fact that it completely neglects the worst cases at quantiles smaller than
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha

   .

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Taking
   <math display="inline">
    ES_{\alpha}
   </math>
   (see
   <b>
    Expected Shortfall
   </b>
   ) as an example of SMR, it is easy to show that its risk spectrum is given by
   <math display="inline">
    \phi^{ES_{\alpha}}(p) = \alpha^{-1} \mathbf{1}_{p &lt; \alpha}
   </math>
   , namely, it is flat on
   <math display="inline">
    [0, \alpha]
   </math>
   and vanishing elsewhere. This is a perfectly coherent choice corresponding to an equally weighted average of all the cases beyond the
   <math display="inline">

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The function
   <math display="inline">
    \phi

Notice also the different convention between the actuarial literature (where losses are modeled as positive variables) and the financial literature (where profits are modeled as positive variables).

   These conditions represent the cornerstone of axiomatic financial risk theory and strong arguments have been given to show that any measure of risk violating them turns out to be inappropriate for capital allocation purposes. In particular, subadditivity embodies the risk diversification principle and prevents the occurrence of paradoxical regulatory arbitrages. Adopting a nonsubadditive measure of risk to compute the regulatory capital of a portfolio, in fact, one can, in principle, obtain a lower value by just splitting the portfolio into two parts and computing the regulatory capital on each part [3].

  <p block-type="Text">
   A measure of risk is said to be

   This property may appear puzzling at first sight because every statistic obviously satisfies it. It has, however, to be kept in mind that not all CMRs are "statistics" because they are defined without necessarily specifying a probability space, but by specifying only a set of events [4] (see Convex Risk Measures). Hence, law invariance is a stringent condition on CMRs, and, in fact, it is the condition characterizing all CMRs that are also statistics and can therefore be estimated from data [2]. This condition is therefore often considered as inevitable for practical risk

   </math>
   vanishes in the limiting case when they happen to be comonotonic, which means they are perfectly dependent on each other (for a definition of comonotonicity, see, for instance, [5]). This property is also crucial, particularly in the context of capital adequacy in association with subadditivity, because, if it does not hold, another kind of regulatory arbitrage opportunity appears. By exploiting subadditivity, one could lower the capital requirement of two distinct portfolios by just putting them together, even in the comonotonic case when they provide no mutual hedge at all. It seems, in other words, that the diversification principle is correctly represented by conditions (iv) and (vii) together and not by subadditivity alone.
