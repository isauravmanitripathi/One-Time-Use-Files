A cohort of economists, notably at the University of Chicago (Merton Miller, Eugene Fama, and Richard Roll), at MIT (Paul Samuelson), and at Carnegie Mellon University (Thomas Sargent), initially followed his steps. In his PhD thesis, Eugene Fama confirmed that the frequency distribution of the changes in the logarithms of prices was \"leptokurtic\", that is, with a high peak and fat tails. However, other notable economists (Paul Cootner and Clive Granger) opposed Mandelbrot's proposal, on the basis of the argument that \"the statistical theory that exists for the normal case is nonexistent for the other members of the class of Levy laws.\" The ´ <i>coup de grace</i> was the mounting empirical evidence that the distributions of returns were becoming closer to the Gaussian law at timescales larger than one month, at odds with the self-similarity hypothesis associated with the Levy ´ laws [7, 23]. Much of the efforts in the econophysics literature of the late 1990s and early 2000s revisited and refined this hypothesis, confirming on one hand the existence of the variance (which rules out the class of Levy distributions proposed by Mandel- ´ brot), but also suggesting a power-law tail with an exponent close to 3 [16, 32]—several other groups have discussed alternatives, such as exponential [39]</p>",

He later returned to finance in the late 1990s in the midst of the econophysics' enthusiasm to model the multifractal properties associated with the long-memory properties observed in financial asset returns [2, 30, 31, 34, 43].</p>",

The value of this strategy remains to be validated [42], as most econophysicists have not yet digested the subtleties of economic thinking and failed to marry their ideas and techniques with mainstream economics. The following is a partial list of a few notable exceptions: precursory physics approach to social systems [15], agent-based models, induction, evolutionary models [1, 9, 11, 21], option theory for incomplete markets [4, 6], interest rate curves [5, 38], minority games [8], theory of Zipf law and its economic consequences [12, 13, 27], theory of large price fluctuations [14], theory of bubbles and crashes [17, 22, 40], random matrix theory applied</p>",
