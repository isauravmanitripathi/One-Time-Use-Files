    Basket Default Swaps
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Basket default derivatives or swaps are more sophisticated credit derivatives that are linked to several underlying credits. The standard product is an insurance contract that offers protection against the event of the kth default on a basket of
   <math display="inline">
    n, n &gt; k
   </math>
   , underlying names. It is similar to a plain credit default swap (CDS) but the credit event to insure against is the event of the
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   th default, and it is not specified to a particular name in the basket. A premium, or spread,
   <math display="inline">
    s
   </math>
   is paid as an insurance fee until maturity or the event of kth default. We denote by
   <math display="inline">
    s^{k\text{th}}
   </math>
   the fair spread in a
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   th-to-default swap, that is, the spread making the value of this swap equal to zero at inception. For the basic product description, we refer, for example, to [2, 3, 12].
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   If the
   <math display="inline">
    n
   </math>
   underlying credits in the basket default swap are independent, the fair spread
   <math display="inline">
    s^{1st}
   </math>
   of a first-todefault swap (FtD) is expected to be close to the sum of the fair individual default swap spreads
   <math display="inline">
    s_i
   </math>
   over all underlying credits
   <math display="inline">
    i = 1, \ldots, n
   </math>
   . For exponential waiting times, this follows since the minimum of exponentially distributed waiting times has itself an exponential distribution with an intensity that equals the sum of the intensities of the individual waiting times. If, on the other hand, the underlying credits are in some sense "totally" dependent the first default will be the one with the worst spread; therefore
   <math display="inline">
    s^{1\text{st}} = \max_i(s_i).
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   For the exact determination of the fair spread of basket default swaps, multivariate modeling of the default times of the credits in the basket is necessary. This dependency modeling can be classified into three different approaches, which are also used in collateralized debt obligations (CDO)-modeling (see Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO)):

    Modeling Approaches

  </h3>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Copula Approach
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   As contingent payments are only triggered in case of default, copula modeling focuses on the multivariate distribution of default times.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The copula approach was first applied in this context in [13, 14]. The challenge is to specify a function
   <math display="inline">
    C
   </math>
   such that with given marginal distribution
   <math display="inline">
    F_i
   </math>
   , we have that
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \text{Prob}\{\tau_1 \le t_1, \dots, \tau_n \le t_n\} = F(t_1, \dots, t_n)
   </math>
   <math display="block">
    = C(F_1(t_1), \dots, F_n(t_n))
   </math>
   (1)
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Basically, the set of Copula functions coincides with the set of all multivariate distribution functions whose marginal distributions are uniform distributions on
   <math display="inline">
    [0, 1]
   </math>
   , since under certain regularity assumptions
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    C(u_1,\ldots,u_n) = F(F_1^{-1}(u_1),\ldots,F_n^{-1}(u_n)) \quad (2)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   One of the most elementary copula functions is the normal copula (or Gauss copula), which is derived by this approach from the multivariate normal distribution (see Gaussian Copula Model). Clearly, there are various different copulas generating all kinds of dependencies, for example, in [3, 12]. The advantage of the normal copula, however, is that it relates to the one period version of certain asset-value models used in credit portfolio risk modeling. But note that since the asset-value approach can only model defaults up to a single time horizon
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   , the calibration between the two models can only be done for one fixed horizon. Dynamic extensions of this in the asset-value context are exit time models.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Asset-value Models
  </h4>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   In asset-value models we are looking for stochastic processes
   <math display="inline">
    (Y_t^i)
   </math>
   called
   <i>
    ability-to-pay processes
   </i>
   and (nonstochastic) barriers
   <math display="inline">
    K_i(t)
   </math>
   such that the default time
   <math display="inline">
    \tau_i
   </math>
   for credit
   <i>
    i
   </i>
   can be modeled as the first hitting time of the barrier
   <math display="inline">
    K_i(t)
   </math>
   by the process
   <math display="inline">
    (Y_i^i)
   </math>
   :
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \tau_i = \inf\{t \ge 0 : Y_t^i \le K_i(t)\}\tag{3}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   First, successful models of this class are reached when
   <math display="inline">
    Y^i
   </math>
   are either Brownian motions with drift or time changed Brownian motions; see [9, 15], where also some numerical calibration results are shown. Exit times of more general stochastic processes, including stochastic volatility models, are applied to default modeling in [8].
  </p>
  <h4>
   Reduced-form Modeling
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Here we start from the classical single-name CDS approach, where the default time is a double stochastic Poisson process (or Cox-process); see
   <b>
    Hazard
   </b>
   Rate; Multiname Reduced Form Models and [5, 6, 11]. In this approach, it is assumed that conditional on a realization of a path of the default intensity, the default time is distributed like the time of the first jump of a time-inhomogeneous Poisson process with this intensity. Typically, the dynamics of resulting credit spreads are closely tied to the dynamics of the default intensity in this approach.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The main challenge here is the incorporation of default dependence. One either has to model common jumps in the spread processes or applies the copula approach exogenously to the default times given from the spread and hazard rates [4, 17]. Recently, an even more reduced approach was developed [1, 7, 18, 19] in which the accumulated losses
   <math display="inline">
    (L_t)_{t&gt;0}
   </math>
   are modeled directly as a stochastic process. The
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   most general construction (as e.g., in [7]) is to view
   <math display="inline">
    L
   </math>
   as an increasing cadlag pure Jump process with absolute continuous compensator
   <math display="inline">
    v(\mathrm{d}t, \mathrm{d}x) =
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    g(t, dx)dt
   </math>
   ; see, for example, [10] for the underlying stochastic analysis. This is particularly useful, if one considers options on the spread
   <math display="inline">
    s^{k\text{th}}
   </math>
   of a basket swap. Here, the modeling attempt is on
   <math display="inline">
    L
   </math>
   and the singlename modeling is not considered.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Pricing
  </h4>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   In order to price basket default swaps, we need the distribution
   <math display="inline">
    F_{(k:n)}(t)
   </math>
   of the time
   <math display="inline">
    \tau^{k\text{th}}
   </math>
   of the kth default. The
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   th default time is, in fact, the order statistic
   <math display="inline">
    \tau_{(k:n)}
   </math>
   ,
   <math display="inline">
    k \leq n
   </math>
   , and, in general, we can derive the distribution of the
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   th order statistics from the multivariate distribution functions [3]. For pricing we also need the survival function:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">

    S_{(k:n)}(t) = 1 - F_{(k:n)}(t) \tag{4}

   . The second part is the present value of the payment at the time of the
   <math display="inline">

   th default. Since the recovery rates might be different for the
   <math display="inline">
    n
   </math>
   underlying names, we have to sum up over all names and weigh with the probability that the
   <math display="inline">

   th default happens around
   <math display="inline">

   th defaulted name is just
   <math display="inline">
    i

   (we assume that there are no joint defaults at exactly the same time). So
   <math display="inline">
    F_{(k:n)}^{k\text{th}=i}
   </math>
   is the probability distribution of the
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   th order statistic of the default times and that
   <math display="inline">
    k\text{th} = i
   </math>
   . Figure 1 [3] shows the
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   th-to-default spreads for a basket of three underlyings with fair spreads
   <math display="inline">
    s_1 = 0.009
   </math>
   ,
   <math display="inline">
    s_2 = 0.010
   </math>
   , and
   <math display="inline">
    s_3 = 0.011
   </math>
   , and pairwise equal normal copula correlation on the x-axis. In [16], it was already observed that the sum of the
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   th-to-default swap spreads is greater than the sum of the individual spreads, that is,
   <math display="inline">
    \sum_{k=1}^{n} s^{kth} &gt; \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i
   </math>
   . Both sides insure exactly the same risk, so this discrepancy is due to a windfall effect of the first-to default swap. At the time of the first default, one stops paying the huge spread
   <math display="inline">
    s^{1st}
   </math>
   on the one side but on the plainvanilla side one stops just paying the spread
   <math display="inline">
    s_i
   </math>
   of the first defaulted obligor
   <math display="inline">
    i
