    Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The second fundamental theorem of asset pricing concerns the mathematical characterization of the economic concept of market completeness for liquid and frictionless markets with an arbitrary number of assets. The theorem establishes the mathematical necessary and sufficient conditions in order to guarantee that every contingent claim on the market can be duplicated with a portfolio of primitive assets. For finite asset economies, completeness (i.e., perfect replication of every claim on the market by admissible self-financing strategies) is equivalent to uniqueness of the equivalent martingale measure. This result can be extended to market models with an infinite number of assets by defining completeness in terms of approximate replication of claims by attainable ones. Hence several definitions of completeness are possible, and in the sequel we will present and discuss them extensively.

  <p block-type="Text">
   The
   <i>
    second fundamental theorem
   </i>
   appeared in [9] under the assumption that the interest rate is zero and that the agent employs only simple trading strategies to address the following issue, raised in the economic literature [1, 20, 22]: given a financial market, which contingent claims are "spanned" by a given set of market securities?
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In the seminal paper [7], it was already observed that in the idealized Black-Scholes market the cash flow of an option can be duplicated by managing a portfolio containing only stock and bond. A natural question is then as follows: for which contingent claim does this result hold in more general markets? When does it hold for all contingent claims on the market?

   In Theorem 1 the definition of the space

   is crucial, as shown by a counterexample in [19]. From reference [16] we obtain that

   must be the largest class of integrands over which multidimensional integrals with respect to
   <math display="inline">
    Z

   can be defined, as done implicitly in [11]. Hence by Theorem 4.6 of [12] we have that
   <math display="inline">
    L(Z)
   </math>
   is the space of the vector-valued, predictable processes
   <math display="inline">

   We have seen that the key to completeness is the predictable representation property. Hence, a natural question concerns the kind of martingales for which the predictable representation property is satisfied. For the continuous case, we have that the predictable representation property holds for diffusion processes that are martingales and have either Lipschitz coefficients [24] or a nondegenerate diffusion matrix and continuous coefficients [14]. The only one-dimensional martingales with stationary and independent increments that satisfy the predictable representation property are the Wiener and the Poisson martingales [25]. Hence the representation property holds for finite Lévy measures, but it fails for infinite Lévy measures. In the next section, we discuss the

   in the case of infinite dimensional financial markets.

  <h4>
   Infinite Number of Assets
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Many applications of hedging involve dynamic trading in principle in infinitely many securities, for example, in pricing of interest rate derivatives by using pure discount bonds or in the use of the term and strike structure of European put and call options to hedge exotic derivatives, when asset prices are driven by Lévy measures. Hence it is natural to develop infinite dimensional market models to address this kind of issues. The problem now is to establish if the second fundamental theorem still holds, and if the market is endowed with an infinite number of assets.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   By defining a complete market via the density of a vector space, the second fundamental theorem is in [8] proved to hold true for (infinitely many) continuous and bounded asset price processes, if all the martingales with respect to the reference filtration
   <math display="inline">
    \mathcal{F}_t
   </math>
   are continuous ([8], Theorem 6.7). In the case of a general filtration, Theorem
   <math display="inline">
    6.5
   </math>
   of [8] states that completeness is equivalent for
   <math display="inline">
    P^*
   </math>
   to be an extreme point of
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{P}
   </math>
   , that is, a weaker version of the
   <i>
    second
   </i>
   fundamental theorem holds.

   in which the market is complete; yet, there exists an infinity of equivalent martingale measures. Since the formulation of this counterexample, many papers have studied the problem of extending the result of the second fundamental theorem to markets with infinitely many assets. Since many definitions of completeness are possible, the solution to the counterexample of
   <math display="inline">
    [2]
   </math>
   relies on the choice of the definition of completeness that is adopted. A first answer to this problem was provided in 1997 by Björk et al. [5, 6], where Theorem 6.11 shows that in the presence of infinitely many assets and a continuum of jump sizes, the uniqueness of the equivalent martingale measure is equivalent to the market being
   <i>
    approximately complete
   </i>
   , that is, every bounded contingent claim can be approached in
   <math display="inline">
    L^2(Q)
   </math>
   for some
   <math display="inline">
    Q \in \mathbb{P}
   </math>
   by a sequence of hedgeable claims.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   In 1999, a number of papers appeared [3, 4,
   <math display="inline">
    15, 17
   </math>
   at the same time, where new definitions of market completeness were proposed in order to maintain the second fundamental theorem, even in complex economies. The equivalence between market completeness and uniqueness of the pricing measure is maintained by introducing a notion of market completeness that is independent both of the notion of no arbitrage and of a chosen equivalent martingale measure. In finite-dimensional markets, the definition of market completeness is given in terms of replicating value processes in economies without arbitrage possibilities and with respect to a given equivalent martingale measure. However, the issue of completeness is about the ability to replicate certain cash flows, and not about how these cash flows are valued or whether these values are arbitrage free. From this perspective, the appropriate measure to address the issue of completeness is the statistical probability measure
   <math display="inline">
    P
   </math>
   , and not an equivalent martingale measure that may also not exist. In reference [17], this new approach was also motivated by the empirical asset pricing literature. Moreover, an example in [3] shows an economy where the existence of an equivalent martingale measure precludes the possibility of market completeness. Hence in references
   <math display="inline">
    [3, 4, 15,
   </math>
   17], the concept of exact (almost everywhere) replication of a contingent claim
   <i>
    via
   </i>
   an admissible portfolio is substituted by the notion of approximation of a contingent claim. The main outlines of this approach are the following.

  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Let

   be interpreted as a market agent's personal way of assigning values to claims, that is, the set M represents the possible contingent claims valuation measures held by traders. An agent using the valuation measure
   <math display="inline">
    Q \in \mathbb{M}
   </math>
   assigns to a contingent claim H the value
   <math display="inline">
    \int H dQ

   . The fact that M is given by the Pabsolutely continuous signed measures on
   <math display="inline">
    \mathcal{F}_T
   </math>
   has two particular meanings: first that all traders agree on null events, and second, that there can be strictly positive random variables with negative personal value. For a given trader, represented by
