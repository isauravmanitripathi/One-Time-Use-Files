General obligation bonds use tax revenue to pay back bondholders, while revenue bonds use money generated from the works themselves; a toll road, for instance, would pay the bond interest using monies raised by tolls. Neither is necessarily a more secure investment. General obligation municipal bonds, which tie interest payments to taxes, are rated based on the creditworthiness of their issuers. Since these are local or state governments, they are assessed by comparing the strength of their tax base to their debt service requirements. Revenue bonds, in contrast, are rated based on their <i>debt service coverage ratio</i>, which divides the amount of interest to be paid by the amount of money available, as estimated by analysis of past and future data. Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's, and Fitch Ratings are the large commercial ratings agencies that establish the basis for most assessments of municipal bond ratings.</p>",

A <i>call risk</i> refers to the possibility that the issuer will redeem a bond before its maturity date, meaning that purchasers will not earn the subsequent interest. Issuers typically may redeem bonds at stipulated dates, starting at 10 years from the date of issue, and at 5-year intervals thereafter, at prices increasing from par, though housing bonds can have more irregular call features.

In contrast, discount bonds have yields, which include a taxable capital gain because they are sold at prices below their maturity value. Only coupon interest is exempt from federal taxes, which lowers discount bonds' actual yield below their quoted yield to maturity. Premium bonds have a higher coupon value, meaning that they produce more interest income, making them better suited to investors who want their shortterm municipal bond holdings to yield an income to reinvest. Others looking to hold onto their bonds to maturity and use them to fund long-term investments will be better served by discount bonds.</p>",

This is typically done by balancing the dollar durations of one basis point of the bond and one basis point of the hedge. At the same time, the arbitrageur proceeds under the assumptions that the yield on the bond and the yield on the hedge will not remain symmetrical and that this yield ratio itself is influenced by interest-rate changes. What the arbitrageur must attempt to anticipate is the hedge beta, or the change in municipal yields that accompanies any change in taxable yields. Traders use several methods to estimate hedge beta. Ratio-based hedges use the yield ratio itself, supposing that it will revert to a mean or to the overall market. Regression-based hedges differ in that they account for the usual inverse correlation between yield ratios and interest rates. Alternately, some traders consider the interest-rate variance as the key component of the position and hedge accordingly. It is also possible to hedge against the callability of longer municipal bonds (which is typically priced into quoted yields).</p>",

Leverage is achieved in the taxable bond market by means of repurchase transactions, in which the owner of a security sells it to a second party while agreeing to repurchase it later at a higher price. If a lender provides similar means to purchase a municipal bond, the interest he receives will still be fully taxable. However, borrowers cannot deduct this interest cost, since they are purchasing a tax-exempt security. As a result, borrowers will generally receive a lower yield from the lender even though they are financing at a higher rate.</p>",
