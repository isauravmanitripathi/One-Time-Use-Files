    Commodity Trading

  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Considerable concern has grown around speculative opportunities in commodity markets, which attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in recent years. In February 2008, a Reuter news item announced that "London coffee, cocoa and sugar futures rallied (
   <i>
    ...
   </i>
   ) to multi-year peaks as investment funds and speculators shifted money into soft commodities in search of stellar returns." In July 2008, Brent oil was quoted at its historical peak of 174.27 USD per barrel, before losing about 70% of that quote four months later (December 2008). Equally significant changes occurred in the prices of cotton, coffee, wheat, soybeans, corn as well as aluminum and copper.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Since unit production costs of agricultural and nonagricultural commodities did not vary so extensively in the same period—nor did consumption—we cannot just attribute the recent marked price changes to their fundamentals. Commodity index funds, hedge funds, and speculators are, therefore, the center of huge fluctuations, changing vastly the drivers of commodity markets.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Speculative opportunities are an obvious reason for this wide interest.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In oil futures markets, a significant role of speculation has been identified to explain the large daily upward and downward shifts observed in prices [3]. Thus, even these extremely liquid instruments suffer from liquidity shocks that induce periods of increased volatility and significant returns predictability [12]. These authors conclude that the oil futures market is not driven only by fundamentals.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Empirical papers have reported evidence of predictability in commodity markets (see among others [14, 17, 20]). Moreover, theoretical contributions [5, 6, 21] attribute a key role to inventories to limit extreme price fluctuations, recognizing at the same time that inventories introduce predictability on (storable) commodity prices.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Finally, the attraction to speculation on commodity markets can be self-induced.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   "Herd behavior" on the side of speculators [7] or "excess consensus" [22] can exacerbate price movements in commodity futures markets and large storage owners can profit from large price deviations. Spurred by the growing attention of specialized press and by the academic evidence showing that commodity
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   futures portfolios can be managed similarly to equities portfolios [16], the investment industry started offering products, allowing individuals and institutions to "invest" in commodities through several derivatives and structured notes. The performance of such products can be compared to that of popular commodity indices (e.g., Sachs commodity index) and have allowed some authors, as Domanski and Heath [9], to introduce the term
   <i>
    financialization
   </i>
   of commodity markets.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In commodity markets, predictability is essentially equivalent to mean reversion of prices as several theoretical and empirical contributions have shown (e.g., [1, 4, 10, 18] for securities [24], for commodities, and [8, 19] for electricity).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In their theoretical analysis on the role of inventories, Deaton and Laroque [5, 6] observe that the price boundaries introduced by inventory owners turn out to generate mean reversion in the price process.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   From an empirical point of view, Elam [11] observes that the price of December cotton futures (at planting time) helps forecasting the cotton price at harvest. In particular, when futures price is higher than its long-term average, spot price tends to be lower and
   <i>
    vice versa
   </i>
   . This is exactly a mean-reverting behavior.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In their empirical analysis of several commodity markets [2], the authors adapt a simple trading strategy to exploit significant mean reversion observed in the corresponding price processes.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Till [25] takes into consideration two historically profitable trading strategies based on the meanreverting properties of commodity prices.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Predictability and the relevance of mean reversion on commodity markets have also been contrasted, as in [23]. Nevertheless, the authors cannot deny the significance of mean reversion over periods longer than six months.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   This evidence justifies the interest of this work. We devise optimal boundaries for the entry and exit timing of a trading strategy in a mean-reverting market.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Since our strategy is based on the peculiar properties of a mean-reverting stationary price process, it is important to observe that as long as such a strategy remains profitable, the presence of a mean-reverting stationary behavior is confirmed.

  <h2>
   The Trading Strategy
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Consider a mean-reverting process of an asset price
   <math display="inline">
    x
   </math>
   on which a long and a short position can be taken (such as a spot or a forward contract). The process can described by the following stochastic differential
   <math display="inline">
    \text{equation} \quad \text{(SDE)}
   </math>
   :
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    dx = -\lambda (x - \Phi) dt + \theta dW \qquad (1)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    \lambda
   </math>
   is the continuous speed of reversion,
   <math display="inline">
    \theta
   </math>
   the diffusion coefficient, and
   <math display="inline">
    \Phi
   </math>
   is the long run average. If we consider discrete time intervals of length
   <math display="inline">
    \Delta t
   </math>
   , the corresponding discrete autoregressive process is
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    x_{t+1} = x_t + k(\Phi - x_t) + \sigma \varepsilon_{t+1} \tag{2}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    k = 1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t}
   </math>
   ,
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma^2 = \frac{1 - e^{-2\lambda \Delta t}}{2\lambda} \theta^2
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    \{\varepsilon_n\}
   </math>
   are independent and identically distributed
   <math display="inline">
    N(0, 1)
   </math>
   . As soon as the process
   <math display="inline">
    x_t
   </math>
   diverges from
   <math display="inline">
    \Phi
   </math>
   , the drift adjusts instantaneously to revert back to
   <math display="inline">
    \Phi
   </math>
   . The reversion speed depends on
   <math display="inline">
    k
   </math>
   (
   <math display="inline">
    0 \le k \le 1
   </math>
   ). The case
   <math display="inline">
    k = 0
   </math>
   corresponds to a random walk.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   To keep things simple, we assume that the long run average is a constant. Still, we are aware that for long-term trading strategies, it could be worth considering the inflationary or other trend elements of this average. Our one-factor process limits the shape of the forward curve more severely than it actually happens. Further, the long run average could be stochastic itself. This can be a key factor that makes the process nonstationary
   <math display="inline">
    [15]
   </math>
   . On the other hand, in the empirical application that follows, we will see that a constant long run price average is statistically consistent at the usual levels for several markets. Besides, the assumption of a constant
   <math display="inline">
    \Phi
   </math>
   can be reasonable for finite (especially short) horizon strategies and has the advantage of improving the mathematical tractability.

   We consider a strategy that is very close to a simple buy-and-hold. For ease of illustration, we account only for profits and losses, ignore the margin requirements, and do not consider transaction costs. We assume a zero-risk-free rate.

   This trading strategy can be implemented on the spot (respectively, futures) market, assuming that

Such aspects do not alter our results. Further, by assuming a zero interest rate and equally balancing the frequencies of long and short positions, we do not need to account for gains and losses generated by borrowing/lending positions.&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;

   Estimates and tests of stationarity and reversion speed are shown in Table 2. The stationarity test is based on a standard augmented Dickey-Fuller's

   ). Live cattle and cotton are significantly stationary and mean reverting. For gas oil and copper, stationarity is rejected, mainly due to the marked rise in prices that has occurred in the recent years; as a consequence, the reversion speed coefficients are not significantly different from zero. Coffee and wheat are not stationary, while their reversion coefficients are significant at 5% level.

   Tables 3 and 4 report the results of MRS and FRS, respectively. To make results comparable among commodities, profits and losses are expressed as an average of all profit/losses under each maturity and are normalized as a percentage of the corresponding historical average price. Thus, figures may be taken as the average "rate of return" obtained by applying the strategy on one unit of the underlying commodity over a period of length

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The empirical outcomes confirm the theoretical expectations only for live cattle and cotton, where both stationarity and mean reversion are statistically acceptable. The other commodities, for which stationarity is weak or not significant, offer significant positive returns only on a strict range of the trading intervals or even show significant losses. The lack of stationarity of gas oil, copper, and coffee generates average losses almost over all maturities. Puzzling results as returns turning from positive (for shorter maturities) to negative (for longer ones) may be explained by markets mixing "momentum" and "reverting" regimes, where prices revert to their historical average in the short run but tend to systematically diverge on longer observation periods. This is the case of wheat from 1986 to 1995 or from 1998 to 2007.
  </p>
  <h1>
   Conclusions
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We proposed a trading rule exploiting the peculiarities of a mean reversion process and investigated the related properties. The empirical results confirm the simulation analyses and show how our strategies perform nicely in markets that are stationary and mean reverting.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Such results lead to some relevant conclusions about the current hypothesis of mean reversion in commodity markets. Mean reversion can be a relevant component of the process governing many commodities. However, our results, in particular for wheat, are more consistent with markets showing regimes switching from reversion to momentum and back.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Moreover, commodity prices are not always stationary. Metals and energy prices were relatively stationary for a long time, but experienced a strong positive trend in the recent years. Many agricultural commodities mix trend with stationarity. The opportunity to fruitfully adopt our strategies is, therefore, linked to the ability of discriminating, for each commodity, stationarity from momentum market phases, which can be an easier task than forecasting size and sign of the future price changes. In such a case, switching from a momentum to a meanreverting strategy can be a useful practice for many investors and traders.
