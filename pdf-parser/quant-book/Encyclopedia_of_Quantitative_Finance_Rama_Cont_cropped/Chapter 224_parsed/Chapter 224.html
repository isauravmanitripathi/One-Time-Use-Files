    Yield Curve Construction
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The objective of an interest rate model is to describe the random movement of a curve of zero-coupon bond prices through time, starting from a known initial condition. In reality, however, only a few shortdated zero-coupon bonds are directly quoted in the market at any given time, a long stretch from the assumption of many models that an initial curve of zero-coupon bond prices is observable for a continuum of maturities. Fortunately, a number of liquid securities depend, in relatively straightforward fashion, on zero-coupon bonds, opening up for the possibility of uncovering zero-coupon bond prices from prices of such securities. Still, as only a finite set of securities are quoted in the market, constructing a continuous curve of zero-coupon bond prices will require us to complement market observation with an interpolation rule, based perhaps on direct assumptions about functional form or perhaps on a regularity norm to be optimized on. A somewhat specialized area of research, discount curve construction relies on techniques from a number of fields, including statistics and computer graphics. We discuss the basic topics in detail and refer the reader to appropriate sources for advanced applications. In the same spirit, we pay scant attention to the subtle intricacies of actual swap and bond market conventions.

   The choice of the securities to be included in the benchmark set depends on the market under consideration. For instance, to construct a treasury bond curve, it is natural to choose a set of treasury bonds and T-bills. On the other hand, if we are interested in constructing a discount curve applicable for bonds issued by a particular firm, we would naturally use bonds and loans used by the firm in question. In many applications, the most important yield curve is the
   <i>
    Libor curve
   </i>
   , constructed out of market quotes for Libor deposits, swaps, and Eurodollar futures. In the construction of this curve, most firms would use a few certificates of deposit for the first 3 months of the curve, followed by a strip of Eurodollar futures&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; (with maturities staggered 3 months apart) out to
   <math display="inline">
    3
   </math>
   or 4 years. Par swaps are then used for the rest of the curve, often going out to 30 years or more.

    Construction Principles

     1. We can introduce new and unspanned securities such that

    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     2. We can use a parameterization of the yield curve with precisely
     <math display="inline">
      N
     </math>
     parameters, using the
     <math display="inline">
      N
     </math>
     equations in equation (4) to recover these parameters.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     3. We can search the space of all solutions to equation
     <math display="inline">
      (4)
     </math>
     and choose the one that is "optimal" according to a given criterion.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Let us provide some comments to these three ideas. First, in option 1, introduction of new securities might not truly be possible—such securities may simply not exist—but sometimes interpolation rules applied to the given benchmark set may allow us to provide reasonable values for an additional set of "fictitious" securities. Although it can occasionally be useful in preprocessing to pad an overly sparse benchmark set, this idea will often require some quite
   <i>
    ad hoc
   </i>
   decisions about the specifics of the fictitious securities, and excessive use may ultimately lead to odd-looking curves and suboptimal hedge reports. When an interpolation rule is to be used, it is typically better to apply it to fundamental quantities such as zero-coupon yields or forward rates, thereby maintaining a higher degree of control over the resulting yield curve.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In option 2 above, parametric functional forms such as that in
   <math display="inline">
    [9]
   </math>
   are sometimes used, but it is far more common to work with a spline representation with
   <math display="inline">
    N
   </math>
   user-selected knots (typically at the maturity dates of the benchmark securities), with the level of the yield curve at these knots constituting the
   <math display="inline">
    N
   </math>
   unknowns to be solved for. We discuss the details of this approach in the section Yield Curve Fitting with
   <math display="inline">
    N
   </math>
   -knot Splines, using a number of different spline types. We assume some knowledge of spline theory here—classical references are [2, 11].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Option 3 is covered in the section Nonparametric Optimal Yield Curve Fitting and constitutes the most sophisticated approach. It can often be stated in completely nonparametric terms, with the yield curve emerging naturally as the solution to an optimization problem. If carefully stated, this approach can be set up to also handle the situation where the system of equations (4) is (near-) singular, in the sense that either no solutions exist or all solutions are irregular and nonsmooth.

However, we may

   While the

As discussed in [1, 6], among others, twice differentiable cubic spline yield curves are often subject to oscillatory behavior, spurious inflection points, poor extrapolation behavior, and nonlocal behavior when prices in the benchmark set are perturbed. In particular, perturbation of a single benchmark price can cause a slow-decaying "ringing" effect on the
   <math display="inline">

   <math display="inline">

   Nonparametric Methods
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The techniques we outlined so far generally suffice for the construction of a discount curve from a "clean" set of non-duplicate benchmark securities, including the carefully selected set of liquid staggered-maturity deposits, futures, and swaps, that most banks assemble for the purpose of constructing a Libor yield curve. In some settings, however, the benchmark set may be significantly less well structured, involving illiquid securities with little order in their cash-flow timing and considerable noise in their prices. This situation may, say, arise when one attempts to construct a yield curve from corporate bonds.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   When the input benchmark set is noisy, a straight solution of (4) may be erratic or may not exist. To overcome this, and to reflect that noise in the input data may make us content to solve (4) only to within certain error bounds, we now proceed to replace this equation by minimization of a penalized least-squares norm. Specifically, define the space

   until the target is met; in general, we would expect the least-squares error term to increase monotonically with

    Special Topics

  </h1>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   While our discussion of curve construction algorithms generally relied on the notion that the forward curve should ideally be
   <i>
    smooth
   </i>
   , there may be circumstances where we want to make exceptions. For instance, it may be reasonable to expect instantaneous forwards to jump on or around meetings of monetary authorities, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States. In addition, other "special" situations may exist that might warrant introduction of discontinuities into the forward curve. A well-known example is the turn-of-year (TOY) effect where shortdated loan premiums spike for loans between the last business day of the year and the first business day of the next year. One common way of incorporating TOY-type effects is to exogenously specify an
   <i>
    overlay curve f (t)
   </i>
   on the instantaneous forward curve. Specifically, the forward curve
   <i>
    f (t)
   </i>
   is written as
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    f(t) = \epsilon_f(t) + f^*(t) \tag{15}

   related, in the sense that they together replicate the prices for foreign exchange forward agreements, as well as cross-currency floating–floating basis swaps. In general, the ability to match currency markets requires that the discount curve and the forward rate curve (e.g., the Libor curve) be separated into two entities separated by a cross-currency spread; see [5]. It is normally straightforward to embed a singlecurrency yield Curve solver into a cross-currency setting, for instance, by means of an iterative adjustment to the price vector

   in equation (4). Similar techniques can be used to accommodate the so-called
