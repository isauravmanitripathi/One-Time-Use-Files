      "html": "<p block-type=\"Text\">With the recent rapid growth in the collateralization debt obligation (CDO) market since its inception in the mid-1990s, many financial institutions, in particular banks, are holding CDO tranches of many different transactions in their credit portfolios. Thus, evaluation of the impact of CDO tranches on the economic capital of a credit portfolio is becoming increasingly important. This article discusses how to measure the impact of CDO tranches on economic capital and capital allocation in credit portfolios. The economic capital of a credit portfolio is the amount of capital reserved to pay for any unexpected losses up to a confidence level as required by the financial institution. The purpose of economic capital is to buffer the effect of large losses in the portfolio. Capital allocation measures the incremental economic capital requirement of a portfolio as a result of adding an asset, such as a CDO tranche. Economic capital and capital allocation are calculated from the probability distribution of portfolio losses. Monte Carlo simulation has been widely applied to calculate the probability distribution of portfolio loss in credit portfolios comprised of bonds and loans. However, it is only recently that Monte Carlo simulations are being used in credit portfolios that comprise CDO tranches in addition to bonds and loans. The methodology presented here addresses this important application in a consistent framework.</p>",

In the section Monte Carlo Simulation of Credit Portfolios Comprised of Bonds, Loans, and Collateralization Debt Obligation (CDO) Tranches, a brief introduction is given to the methodology for calculating portfolio loss distribution of credit portfolios comprised of bonds, loans, and CDO tranches. The section Economic Capital and Capital Allocation discusses the calculation of economic capital and capital allocation from the portfolio loss distribution. In the section An Example of Calculating Portfolio Loss Distribution, an example is presented for calculating the probability distribution of portfolio loss for a portfolio comprised of loans and one synthetic CDO tranche. From the loss distribution, economic allocation to the tranche is calculated and compared with the capital</p>",

The calculation of correlated defaults in a pool composed of loans and CDO tranches consists of two basic steps. The first step is to determine the default or credit migration of bonds and loans in the portfolio together with the underlying assets of CDO tranches over a horizon. The second step is valuing the CDO tranches at horizon. For a CDO tranche, its value would be the sum of the cash flows received over the horizon plus a forward value calculated on the basis of the future credit state of its underlying assets at horizon. Cash flows received by a synthetic tranche over the horizon would consist mainly of interest payments, while those received by a cash CDO tranche would consist of interest payments and principal repayments. The loss of a tranche over a horizon is then calculated as the difference between the tranche value at horizon and its current value. This yields a loss distribution at horizon for a credit portfolio comprised of bonds, loans, and CDO tranches, from which its economic capital and capital allocation are calculated.</p>",

The calculation of the <i>EL</i> of a tranche as of today is based on the approach of Merton [1]. We calculate the defaults of the underlying assets over a horizon of 5 years. The timing of the defaults is not required because the calculation of the expected loss assumes a zero interest rate. It is a one-step calculation of default since both the systematic and idiosyncratic risk factors are drawn once at each scenario of the Monte Carlo simulation. However, the calculation of the <i>EL</i> of the tranche at horizon assumes two steps although the calculation of the defaults in each of these steps is also based on the approach of Merton. It is a two-step calculation of default because both the systematic and idiosyncratic risk factors are drawn independently twice in the outer and inner simulations of the nested Monte Carlo simulation. As a result of calculating the default in a single step in the calculation of <i>EL</i> as of today and in two steps in the calculation of <i>EL</i> at horizon, one should expect the results to be different because of the difference in capturing the correlated defaults in the portfolio.c Since the calculation of portfolio loss distribution requires using this two-step approach in calculating defaults, we should adopt this approach in the calculation of <i>EL</i> of the tranche as of today and at</p>",

Since the maximum loss of a tranche depends on its thickness defined as the difference between its detachment point and attachment point, it is more meaningful to report capital per unit of exposure rather than per unit of notional amount. These results clearly show that capital allocation per unit of exposure increases with increasing exposure. However, the increase is much larger for the 0–3% tranche than for the 6–9% tranche. This is because the 6–9% tranche is mostly sensitive to systematic risk, while the 0–3% tranche is sensitive to both systematic and idiosyncratic risks. An asset that is mostly sensitive to systematic risk and an asset in a very granular portfolio should have capital requirements that scale approximately the same extent with the size of exposures. Capital allocation per unit of exposure of an asset in a very granular portfolio is approximately constant independent of the asset's exposure size. Thus, as shown in Table 2, the capital allocation of a senior tranche increases slowly with exposure size as compared to a junior tranche.</p>",

In general, a credit portfolio with larger systematic risk would require higher economic capital. A CDO transaction backed by a pool of assets is mostly sensitive to systematic risks since its exposures to idiosyncratic risk factors are already significantly reduced through the diversification of the assets in the pool. Therefore, adding CDO tranches to a credit portfolio could significantly increase the portfolio's systematic risk compared to adding a loan equivalent. As a result, one should expect that holding a CDO tranche in a credit portfolio would require extra economic capital compared to holding a loan of similar credit rating and the same maturity.</p>",

One of the advantages of using the methodology presented here is in the calculation of the correlated defaults of the assets in a portfolio. Calculation of correlated defaults is important in calculating economic capital for a portfolio especially for those holding CDO tranches because CDO tranches are mostly sensitive to systematic risk. As an example, we applied the methodology of calculating capital allocation to a synthetic CDO tranche in a credit portfolio. This portfolio also comprises of the loans to which the underlying assets of the CDO are referencing. The results of our calculation show that the capital allocation of adding a CDO tranche to a credit portfolio can be much larger than that of adding a loan of similar credit quality and the same maturity. In some cases, the increase in capital allocation is as much as 80%. Our finding clearly suggests that by treating a CDO tranche as a loan equivalent, only a poor approximation of economic capital is obtained. This explains why the methodology presented in this article is necessary to measure the impact of CDO tranches in credit portfolios.</p>",
