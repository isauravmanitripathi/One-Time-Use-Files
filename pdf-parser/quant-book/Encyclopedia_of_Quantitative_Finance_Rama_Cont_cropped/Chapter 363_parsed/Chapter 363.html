   The ARCH Model
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Financial economists are concerned with modeling and forecasting volatility in asset returns. This is the case since volatility is considered a measure of risk, and investors want a premium for investing in risky assets. Marginal distributions of typical return series have heavy tails, and the series show clustering of volatility. Furthermore, these series have little or no autocorrelation, but they do display higher order dependence. For example, the squared returns are positively autocorrelated. The autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model and its variants have been found useful in describing data with these properties.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The original ARCH model, introduced by Engle [21], can be defined as follows. Let
   <math display="inline">
    \varepsilon_t
   </math>
   be a random variable that has a mean and a variance conditionally on the information set
   <math display="inline">
    \mathcal{F}_{t-1}
   </math>
   that contains all past information up until
   <math display="inline">
    t-1
   </math>
   and available at time t. The ARCH model of
   <math display="inline">
    \varepsilon_t
   </math>
   has the following properties. First, the conditional mean
   <math display="inline">
    \mathsf{E}\{\varepsilon_t|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\}=0
   </math>
   and, second, the conditional variance
   <math display="inline">
    h_t = \mathsf{E}\{\varepsilon_t^2 | \mathcal{F}_{t-1}\}\
   </math>
   is a nontrivial positive-valued parametric function of
   <math display="inline">
    \mathcal{F}_{t-1}
   </math>
   . The sequence
   <math display="inline">
    \{\varepsilon_t\}
   </math>
   may be observed directly. In that case it may be, for example, a sequence of daily returns of an asset or an index. It may also be an unobserved error or innovation sequence of an econometric model. In the latter case,

   <math display="inline">
    y_t

    \mathcal{F}_{t-1}

    h_t

    \mathsf{E}\{y_t|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\}=0.

   , since
   <math display="inline">

  <p block-type="Text">
   The ARCH model and its generalizations are applied to modeling, among other things, highfrequency data on interest rates, exchange rates and stock and stock index returns. "High frequency" in this context means weekly, daily, or intradaily observations. Bollerslev et al. [12] already listed a large variety of applications in their survey of these models, and their number has increased enormously since then. Forecasting volatility of these series is different from forecasting the conditional mean of a process because volatility, the object to be forecast, is not observed. The question then is how volatility should be measured. Using
   <math display="inline">
    \varepsilon_t^2
   </math>
   is an obvious solution, but it is not necessarily a good one if data of higher frequency are available. Andersen and Bollersley [3] and others recommend realized volatility (see Realized Volatility and Multipower Variation) for the purpose; for a review see

  <h4>
   The Generalized ARCH Model and Extensions
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Generalized ARCH. The ARCH model has since been extended by adding lagged conditional variances to equation (3). This extension, called the
   <i>
    generalized
   </i>
   ARCH (GARCH) model, proposed independently by Bollerslev [10] and Taylor [67], has since become very popular. The
   <math display="inline">
    GARCH(p, q)
   </math>
   model has the
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   following form:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    h_{t} = \alpha_{0} + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \alpha_{j} \varepsilon_{t-j}^{2} + \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_{j} h_{t-j} \qquad (4)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   A sufficient condition for the conditional variance
   <math display="inline">
    h_t
   </math>
   in equation (4) to be positive is
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha_0 &gt; 0
   </math>
   ,
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha_i \ge 0
   </math>
   ,
   <math display="inline">
    j = 1, \ldots, q; \ \beta_j \ge 0, \ j = 1, \ldots, p.
   </math>
   This condition is not necessary if either
   <math display="inline">
    p
   </math>
   or
   <math display="inline">
    q
   </math>
   , or both, exceed 1; see [56]. For the GARCH model to be identified if at least one
   <math display="inline">
    \beta_i &gt; 0
   </math>
   (the model is a genuine GARCH model), it is required that also at least one
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha_i &gt; 0
   </math>
   . If
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha_1 = \ldots = \alpha_q = 0
   </math>
   , the conditional and unconditional variances of
   <math display="inline">
    \varepsilon_t
   </math>
   are equal and
   <math display="inline">
    \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p
   </math>
   are unidentified nuisance parameters. The
   <math display="inline">
    GARCH(p,q)
   </math>
   process is weakly stationary if and only if
   <math display="inline">
    \sum_{j=1}^{q} \alpha_j + \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j &lt; 1.
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The overwhelmingly most frequently applied
   <math display="inline">
    GARCH
   </math>
   model has been the
   <math display="inline">
    GARCH(1,1)
   </math>
   model. The weakly stationary
   <math display="inline">
    GARCH(1,1)
   </math>
   model only contains three parameters, but one more parameter can be saved by "variance targeting". The idea is to replace the intercept
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha_0
   </math>
   in equation (4) by
   <math display="inline">
    (1 - \alpha_1 - \beta_1)\sigma^2
   </math>
   where
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma^2 = \mathsf{E}\varepsilon_t^2
   </math>
   . The estimate
   <math display="inline">
    \widehat{\sigma}^2 = T^{-1} \sum_{t=1}^T \varepsilon_t^2
   </math>
   is substituted for
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma^2
   </math>
   before estimating the other two parameters. As a result, the conditional variance converges toward the "long-run" unconditional variance, which may be considered a desirable property of the model.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Since its introduction, the GARCH model has been generalized and extended in various directions. This has been done in order to increase the flexibility of the original model. Because it only contains squared lags of
   <math display="inline">
    \varepsilon_t
   </math>
   , the response of the conditional variance to a shock
   <math display="inline">
    \varepsilon_t
   </math>
   is independent of the sign of the shock and just a function of its size. Several extensions of the GARCH model aim at accommodating the asymmetry in the response, caused by the
   <i>
    leverage effect
   </i>
   present in stock returns. The most frequently applied asymmetric GARCH model is the GJR-GARCH model of [32]. It is defined as follows:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    h_{t} = \alpha_{0} + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \{\alpha_{j} + \delta_{j} I(\varepsilon_{t-j} &gt; 0)\}\varepsilon_{t-j}^{2}
   </math>
   <math display="block">
    + \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_{j} h_{t-j} \qquad (5)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    I(\varepsilon_{t-i} &gt; 0)
   </math>
   is an indicator function obtaining value 1 when the argument is true and 0 otherwise. The asymmetry in the data is modeled through the terms
   <math display="inline">
    \delta_j I(\varepsilon_{t-j} &gt; 0) \varepsilon_{t-j}^2
   </math>
   ,
   <math display="inline">
    j = 1, \ldots, q
   </math>
   , in equation (5). Typically, in applications,
   <math display="inline">
    p = q = 1
   </math>
   . Other asymmetric GARCH models include the asymmetric GARCH (AGARCH) of [27] and the quadratic GARCH of [59]. Furthermore, the smooth transition GARCH (STGARCH) model, introduced by Hagerud [38] and Gonzalez-Rivera [33], can be used for describing asymmetries in return series. This model contains a continuum of regimes, whereas in the GJR-
   <math display="inline">
    GARCH(1,1)
   </math>
   model there are only two regimes with the switch point at
   <math display="inline">
    \varepsilon_t = 0
   </math>
   . The GJR-GARCH model is still linear in parameters, which makes it easier to estimate than, say, the STGARCH model that is genuinely nonlinear in parameters.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   There are other nonlinear GARCH models that have been applied in practice. Perhaps the most prominent example is the Markov-switching GARCH model. It contains a finite number (usually two) of regimes, and the GARCH process switches between them according to a latent random variable. It was originally introduced as an ARCH model (see [16] and
   <math display="inline">
    [39]
   </math>
   ) and is in that form defined as follows:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    h_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \alpha_{0}^{(i)} + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \alpha_{j}^{(i)} \varepsilon_{t-j}^{2} \right) I(s_{t} = i) \qquad (6)
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    s_t
   </math>
   is the discrete latent random variable obtaining values from the set
   <math display="inline">
    S = \{1, \ldots, k\}
   </math>
   of regime indicators. It follows a (usually first-order) homogeneous Markov chain:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \Pr\{s_t = j | s_t = i\} = p_{ij}, \quad i, j = 1, \dots, k \tag{7}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   hence the name Markov-switching GARCH. The transition probabilities
   <math display="inline">
    p_{ij}
   </math>
   are parameters to be estimated. An argument put forward to motivate the use of these models is that they can be applied in situations where the conditional variance process contains breaks, that is, sudden changes in parameters. Augmenting the ARCH form (6) by lags of the conditional variance causes estimation problems; see
   <math display="inline">

   , one obtains the absolute-valued GARCH model. Doing this in the GJR-GARCH model yields the threshold GARCH (TGARCH) model that [71] considered. The TGARCH
   <math display="inline">
    (p, q)
   </math>
   model is usually parameterized somewhat differently from the GJR-GARCH model:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    h_t^{1/2} = \alpha_0 + \sum_{j=1}^q (\alpha_j^+ \varepsilon_{t-j}^+ - \alpha_j^- \varepsilon_{t-j}^-) + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j h_{t-j}^{1/2}

  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    \varepsilon_{t-i}^+ = \max(\varepsilon_{t-j}, 0), \varepsilon_{t-i}^- = \min(\varepsilon_{t-j}, 0),
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha_i^+, \alpha_i^-, j = 1, \ldots, q
   </math>
   , are the corresponding parameters. Like the GJR-GARCH model, even the TGARCH model is linear in parameters. It can be generalized by assuming the switch point to be an unknown parameter, which makes the model nonlinear in parameters. This type of threshold ARCH model was introduced by Li and Li [46] who also considered a threshold autoregressive conditional mean, but it has not enjoyed the same popularity as the TGARCH or the GJR-GARCH model.

   Integrated and Fractionally Integrated GARCH. In applications it often occurs, if the time series is sufficiently long, that the estimated sum of the parameters

   </math>
   in the GARCH(1,1) model (equation (4) with
   <math display="inline">

   ) is close to unity. Engle and Bollerslev [24], who first paid attention to this phenomenon, suggested imposing the restriction
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha_1

   +
   <math display="inline">

   GARCH (IGARCH) model. The IGARCH process is not weakly stationary as

   The empirical fact that the estimate of the sum

First Diebold [18] and later Lamoureux and Lastrapes [44] suggested that this often happens if the intercept of the GARCH process does not remain constant during the estimation period. This may not be surprising as it means that the underlying GARCH process is not stationary. This has aroused interest in testing parameter constancy and finding breaks in the GARCH process; see, for example [43, 52] and [8].

The FIGARCH model thus offers a competing explanation of this empirical phenomenon.

   The GARCH-in-mean Model. Since volatility is viewed as a measure of risk, GARCH models are used for assessing the risk of a portfolio. From this it follows that the GARCH type conditional variance could be useful as a representation of the timevarying risk premium in explaining excess returns, that is, returns compared to the return of a riskless asset. This extends the considerations to involve the conditional mean of the return process as well. An excess return would be a combination of the unforecastable difference

   The standard GARCH model has some disadvantages. Parameter restrictions are required to ensure positivity of the conditional variance at every point of time. Furthermore, the model does not allow an asymmetric response to shocks. This disadvantage was overcome by the appearance of asymmetric GARCH models but this was an important reason for the introduction of the exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model by Nelson [55]. A family of EGARCH

   As in the standard GARCH case, the first-order model
   <math display="inline">

   is the most popular EGARCH model in practice. Nelson [55] derived existence conditions for moments of the general infinite-order exponential ARCH model. For the EGARCH model with

   exist. For example, if

  <h2>
   Nonparametric and Semiparametric GARCH Models
  </h2>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Nonparametric GARCH models have been developed to remedy some of the disadvantages of the standard GARCH model mentioned earlier. A straightforward example is the model (2) in which
   <math display="inline">
    h_t =
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    h(\varepsilon_{t-1}, \ldots, \varepsilon_{t-q})
   </math>
   is a smooth positive-valued function estimated using nonparametric techniques. When
   <math display="inline">
    q
   </math>
   is large, however, this model suffers from the curse of dimensionality. This may be partly remedied by an additive function,
   <math display="inline">
    h_t = \sum_{i=1}^{q} h_j(\varepsilon_{t-j})
   </math>
   , where
   <math display="inline">
    h_i(\varepsilon_{t-i}), j = 1, \ldots, q
   </math>
   , are positive-valued functions that are estimated separately. Both of these models are ARCH models. Engle and Ng [27] introduced the following semiparametric GARCH model:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    h_t = h(\varepsilon_{t-j}) + \beta h_{t-1} \tag{16}

    h(\cdot)

   </math>
   this functional form is more flexible than the standard
   <math display="inline">
    GARCH(1,1)

   model and allows modeling possible asymmetry in returns. For more discussion of nonparametric and semiparametric ARCH and GARCH models, see [50].

   The parameters of the GARCH

    (p, q)

   model (4) and its extensions may be estimated jointly by maximum likelihood. Asymptotic theory for the estimators has been developed over the years. Weiss [70] already proved consistency and asymptotic normality for maximum likelihood estimators in the
   <math display="inline">

   </math>
   case under the assumption
   <math display="inline">
    \mathsf{E}\varepsilon_t^4 &lt; \infty

   , which implies
   <math display="inline">
    \mathsf{E}z_t^4 &lt; \infty

   . General results are provided by Berkes et al. [9] who showed the asymptotic normality of the quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimators of the parameters of the

   <math display="inline">

   </math>
   is required. Francq and Zakoïan [30] proved asymptotic normality of QML estimators for yet another set of conditions, and their results included the ARMA-GARCH family of models. Straumann and Mikosch [66] derived conditions for asymptotic normality of the OML estimators for a class of GARCH models that also includes some nonlinear GARCH models. In particular, they verified these conditions for the estimators of the AGARCH model. The corresponding conditions for the GARCH-in-mean model have not been verified, although consistency of the maximum likelihood estimators has been proven; see [53].

  <p block-type="Text">
   Rather often, the parameters of GARCH models are estimated assuming a
   <math display="inline">

   The parameters of GARCH models have to be estimated numerically because the conditional variances are not observed and have to be estimated separately for each iteration, that is, conditionally on parameter estimates obtained from the previous iteration.

   by maximum likelihood has been the so-called Berndt-Hall-Hall-Hausman (BHHH) algorithm. Its popularity is partly based on the fact that it does not require the second derivatives of the log-likelihood function. Those may be considered difficult to compute given their recursive structure. Nevertheless, Fiorentini et al. [29] worked out the analytical second derivatives of the log-likelihood function for the GARCH model. This makes iterative estimation of parameters by the Newton-Raphson algorithm possible.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Several econometric software packages contain a module for estimating GARCH models. Brooks
   <i>

   [15] studied a number of them, focusing on numerical accuracy of the estimates. Their conclusion was that the algorithms based on analytical derivatives are preferable to the other alternatives. The best performing package used both analytical first and second derivatives. The authors reported substantial differences in numerical accuracy between the packages considered.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   The parameters of the EGARCH model are also estimated by maximum likelihood. Nelson [55] gives the log-likelihood function based on the assumption that the errors follow a generalized error distribution (GED) with mean zero. The normal distribution is a special case of the GED. Nelson also discusses the role of the starting values in the estimation. In his simulations, the use of other starting values rather than the unconditional mean of

  </h2>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   There exist multivariate GARCH models with fewer parameters than the VEC-GARCH model. The conconditional correlation GARCH (CCCstant GARCH) model by Bollerslev [11] is built on the assumption that the conditional correlations between variables remain constant over time. This assumption is more parsimonious than the VEC-GARCH one, because the conditional covariances are determined through conditional variances and these correlations. Suppose again that
   <math display="inline">
    \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_t = (\varepsilon_{1t}, \ldots, \varepsilon_{mt})'
   </math>
   such that
   <math display="inline">

   <math display="inline">
    i, j = 1, \ldots, m
   </math>
   . Each conditional variance is assumed to follow a standard univariate GARCH model (4). The most common choice is the first-order GARCH model:
   <math display="inline">
    p = q = 1
   </math>
   . In this case, a bivariate first-order CCC-GARCH model has 7 parameters compared to 21 in the corresponding VEC-GARCH model.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   One of the attractions of the CCC-GARCH model is that the parameter estimation is not complicated. The (conditional) quasi log-likelihood function of any GARCH model with

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    \boldsymbol{\theta}

   matrix has to be inverted
   <math display="inline">

Even here, the BHHH optimization algorithm has been recommended for maximizing the log-likelihood. The calculations can be made even simpler by concentrating the log-likelihood, but the derivatives of the original log-likelihood (22) are required for obtaining an estimate of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimators of the parameters.

   The BEKK-GARCH Model

   The BEKK-GARCH model (BEKK stands for Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner) is discussed in detail in [25]. It is another parsimonious GARCH model and has the property that the conditions of positive definiteness of the conditional covariance matrix are known. The

   <math display="inline">
    m \times m
   </math>
   triangular matrix, and
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbf{A}_{ik}^* = [\alpha_{ik,il}^*]

   </math>
   is of full rank so that
   <math display="inline">
    (\mathbf{C}_0^*)'\mathbf{C}_0^*

   is positive definite, it follows that
   <math display="inline">

   . This is the main attraction of the BEKK-GARCH model. In applications, it is typically assumed that
   <math display="inline">
    K = p = q = 1
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The log-likelihood function of the BEKK model is equation (20), and its partial derivatives are defined through equation (26). Engle and Kroner [25] remark that in the GARCH case (as opposed to ARCH) calculating analytical derivatives is complicated because it requires recursive computation of certain derivatives. They therefore recommend numerical derivatives and the BHHH algorithm. Nevertheless, Lucchetti [51] has worked out the analytical score for the first-order BEKK-GARCH model when
   <math display="inline">
    K = 1
   </math>
   . Given the results reported in
   <math display="inline">
    [15]
   </math>
   in the univariate case, it appears that making use of the analytical score in the estimation of the parameters of this model would be very useful. Conditions for the asymptotic normality of the QML estimators of the parameters of the BEKK-GARCH model can be found in [17].

   This model has an economic interpretation. Theories of asset pricing suggest that the risk premium of an asset depends on its covariance with other assets as well as its own variance. The factor GARCH model represents those covariances in a parsimonious way and makes it possible to simultaneously consider a larger number of asset returns than many other vector GARCH models would allow in practice. The
   <math display="inline">
    K
   </math>
   factors define as many portfolios of these assets. It is then reasonable to assume that the elements of
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbf{f}_k

    Final Remarks
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The literature on GARCH models is quite voluminous. Modern econometrics texts contain accounts of conditional heteroskedasticity. A number of surveys of GARCH models exist as well. Bollerslev et al. [13], Diebold and Lopez [19], Palm [57], and Guégan [36] survey developments till the early 1990s; see [31] for a very recent survey. Shephard [61] considers both univariate GARCH and stochastic volatility models. Gouriéroux [34] concentrates on ARCH models, both univariate and multivariate. The survey by Bollerslev
   <i>
    et al.
   </i>
   [12] also reviews applications to financial series. The focus in [65] is on estimation in models of conditional heteroskedasticity. Theoretical results on time series models with conditional heteroskedasticity are also reviewed in [47]. Engle [22] provides a selection of the most important articles on ARCH and GARCH models up until 1993. Recent surveys of multivariate GARCH models include [6] and [64]. Several articles in [4] provide detailed descriptions of various aspects of GARCH models and their use in applications.
