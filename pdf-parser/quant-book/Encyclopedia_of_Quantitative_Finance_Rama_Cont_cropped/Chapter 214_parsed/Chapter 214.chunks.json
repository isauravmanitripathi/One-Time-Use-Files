In some cases (in particular, when no coupons are paid), the principal accretes continuously at a rate guaranteeing a given <i>yield to maturity</i> (YTM), and the final redemption value is the result of the accretion. The CB can be redeemed earlier than maturity at the option of the issuer (issuer's call), often with penalties in <i>call protection</i> periods (make-whole premium, guaranteed yield). Alternatively, the holder can opt out of the convertible and get his/her money back at certain prespecified discrete dates, or put dates. Coupons can be fixed or floating. The number of shares against which the CB can be converted is the conversion ratio. The value the holder obtains following conversion is the <i>conversion value</i>: ratio <math display=\"inline\">\\times</math> share value. The <i>conversion price</i> is the ratio of nominal over conversion ratio. It is the value of the underlying above which conversion value becomes greater than the nominal, thus making the conversion potentially attractive.</p>",

Options had been banned in the aftermath of the 1929 market crash, and it was not until the early 1970s that they regained some liquidity and Black and Scholes were able to study them in order to derive their formula. The Chicago Board Options Exchange played no little role, subsequently, in bringing options back in favor, truly resurrecting their markets. (The belief had caught on that the Black–Scholes–Merton (BSM) formula, and the option trading it involved, were not about speculation and gambling after all, but about <i>efficient pricing</i> [6].)</p>",

Recall that conversion is an altogether more consequential transmutation than just exercising a right. The entire convertible can be reread in the light of this difference. The owner of a convertible security is more involved in the company than the buyer of an option. As such, he/she has to be protected.
