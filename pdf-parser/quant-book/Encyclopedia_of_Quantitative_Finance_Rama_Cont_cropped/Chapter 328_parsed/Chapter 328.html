    Liquidity
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   An asset is relatively liquid if it can be traded without significant movement in its price. We typically think of an asset for which large quantities can be traded without substantial price movement as being in a deep and liquid market. In effect, a liquid asset can be traded at modest execution cost, even potentially in substantial size. Market events and turmoil in 2007 and 2008 focused attention upon the nature of illiquidity and have led to renewed interest about the meaning of liquidity as the trading activity in many hard-to-value assets declined significantly and the costs of trading such assets rose substantially.

    The Kyle Framework
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The nature of liquidity is extensively highlighted in the seminal work of Pete Kyle [11], who developed a model of adverse selection and trading cost in a classic analysis of the bid–ask spread with a riskneutral informed investor and market-makers (
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   <b>
    Kyle Model
   </b>
   ).a In this setting when the investor is informed, he/she possesses a normally distributed signal of the value of the asset, and when uninformed, the investor trades a normally distributed exogenously specified quantity. Under the assumption of a linear equilibrium, Kyle [11] derived the unique solution in which the informed investor's trade is a linear function of his/her signal (optimizing an underlying quadratic decision problem) and the pricing at which a competitive market-maker trades is a linear function of the order flow (under the normality assumptions, this reflects a regression that predicts the expected informational cost conditional upon the order flow as the market-maker cannot distinguish an informed order from an uninformed one). The market-maker's (linear) pricing function is such that the cost of trading a position increases proportionately with its size because of the adverse informational consequences of facing a larger order given the decision rule of the informed agent.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   The Kyle framework is consistent with the extent of adverse selection being influenced by current market conditions; in the Kyle context, these conditions are reflected in the structural parameters of the model such as the variability of the signal of the informed and the volatility of the trade of the uninformed. For
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   example, a spike in adverse selection above normal levels, as illustrated by an increase in the variability of the private signal of the informed, implies that liquidity will decline and the price impact of an order of a specified size will increase.b

    The "No-trade" Theorem and "Lemons"
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Another complementary perspective on the nature of illiquidity in an asset market is illustrated by models in which trade need not arise due to informational frictions. For example, the classic "no-trade theorem" in Milgrom and Stokey [13] offers fundamental insights about the nature of illiquidity. The central theorem in [13] is that at a Pareto optimal allocation private signals do not lead to trade. One very simple interpretation that summarizes this conclusion is the "Groucho Marx joke": Groucho Marx declared that he would not join any club whose standards were low enough such that he would qualify for membership.c This intuition is closely related to the "lemons" idea that underlies the classic work of Akerlof [1]. In the Akerlof [1] setting, potential buyers of a used car are discouraged from purchasing it in light of the seller's private information. Since the potential seller has more precise information on the quality of the vehicle than the buyer, the seller will only sell those types of vehicles that are less valuable to it than the price that the buyer is willing to pay. The buyer's valuation is not based upon the actual quality of car that he is purchasing, but on the distribution of relatively low types that the seller is willing to allow the potential buyer to purchase. In the absence of a substantial difference in preference parameters and valuation between the potential buyer and seller, the presence of private information will lead to a breakdown in this marketplace and the absence of trading and liquidity. This provides a form of the "no-trade" theorem. Instead, if the preference differences were sufficient, then some trading (or perhaps even a lot of trading) would arise. If the equilibrium were to support a small volume of trading, then only the lowest quality of cars would be traded. In this context, illiquidity is reflected in low volume (quantity) and low quality arising in the marketplace, that is, most investors do not sell their holdings because they regard the market price as inadequate. For example, the ability of the seller to select specific low-value mortgage-backed securities pools for sale (such as in the context of substantial
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   credit risk those pools not carefully underwritten or which have serious documentation issues) and the extent of adverse selection would have greatly limited the trading of these instruments during portions of the market crisis.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The example that lies at the heart of Akerlof's analysis at least indirectly points to mechanisms by which liquidity can be sustained. If the qualities of the goods being sold were known (transparent) so that there was not private information, then liquidity across the marketplace would be sustainable. Alternatively, if the seller could warrant or guarantee quality to a specified level or alternatively, the buyer could rely upon the seller's market incentives to maintain a reputation for providing an accurate description of quality, then trading would be viable across the quality spectrum. Finally, if the difference in preference valuation between the sellers and buyers were sufficiently great, then these very large potential gains to trade would overcome the adverse selection for at least a significant proportion of the population and lead to trade. Relative to the "no-trade" theorem, trade and liquidity can arise, provided we start at an allocation that is not Pareto optimal.

   <b>
    Trading Volume and Asset Value
   </b>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   An interesting and important dimension of the liquidity of a market is the extent of buying and selling interest. If an asset is relatively idiosyncratic (such as an individual family residence with quirky characteristics), then there is one seller and likely few potential buyers. On the other hand (still within a residential real estate context), some properties may have quite close substitutes (units with similar lay-outs in a high rise condominium or cooperative building) and there could be many potential buyers and sellers. In many market contexts, the level of volume is often viewed as an indicator of liquidity and in the case of futures contracts the extent of open interest would be another such indicator. The connection between volume and prices explicitly arises in several of the key foundational frameworks addressing liquidity issues. For example, in the Kyle [11] framework, a liquid asset is the one in which a modest volume will not move the asset's price very much, so a large volume would be required to move the price substantially. Akerlof's [1] "lemons" analysis associates low trading activity with illiquidity as well as low quality of the goods
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   being exchanged and low prices. More generally, liquid assets typically have high trading volume and turnover.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Relatively liquid (low trading cost) assets are especially valuable and are the natural assets to utilize in a situation in which the owners anticipate high turnover. For example, liquid assets (such as futures contracts in some contexts) are often used by portfolio managers to adjust or maintain their aggregate exposures (to the direction of the equity market or interest rates), potentially even at relatively high frequencies. Less liquid assets are more appropriate for buy-and-hold exposures. To the extent that an investor owns assets with a range of liquidities, we would expect that the most liquid assets would be sold most often. While lower trading costs would enhance value across the spectrum of potential holding periods, the benefits would be especially pronounced for the potentially most active assets. These effects point to important clientele differences among assets of varying liquidity, which are analogous to clientele effects that differentiate assets that are taxed distinctly. However, just as for all investors (except tax-exempt ones) lightly taxed assets are more valuable than heavily taxed assets, similarly more liquid assets are more valuable than less liquid ones. One interesting theme in empirical asset pricing is that liquidity has emerged as a "priced" factor and that assets with higher trading costs provide higher expected returns without excluding the costs.d Much of the focus in market microstructure is in assessing liquidity, informational affects, and trading costs.e
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Increasing liquidity enhances the value of assets not just across instruments (i.e., cross sectionally) but also over time (i.e., in time series) on specific assets as market conditions evolve. When liquidity in the marketplace disappears, the value of assets declines. This is illustrated by a range of market crises—including most recently, the subprime mortgage crisis that began in 2007.

    Investors as Liquidity Providers
   </b>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   Investors themselves can possess considerable liquidity if they have funds available for investment without incurring substantial costs from selling existing positions. In that sense investors can transfer liquidity among assets and liquidity can move from investor to investor (via the assets) through the trading process.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Some investors even specialize in providing liquidity as illustrated by investors engaged in the traditional market-making function (such as a securities dealer or stock market specialist). Even a retail investor who places a limit order in a limit-order book should be viewed as offering liquidity to the marketplace (investors who hit the book consume liquidity). To a degree the dichotomy between demanders and suppliers of liquidity has been reflected in empirical analyses that focus on the interaction between the order flow and limit-order book.f

  <h4>
   <b>
    The Self-fulfilling Nature of Liquidity
   </b>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Liquidity is often viewed as self-fulfilling in the sense that liquidity attracts liquidity.g For example, even in government bond markets there can be instruments with similar features that attract very different trading interest. The "benchmark" government bond in Japan (and to a degree in the United States) has had a higher price (and lower prospective return), but considerably greater trading interest, than other bonds that have similar characteristics.h The theme that liquidity attracts liquidity is nicely illustrated by many aspects of the subprime mortgage crisis. For example, interest in trading collateralized debt obligation (CDO) structures has waned partially due to the drying up of liquidity in many such markets—purchasing such instruments became substantially riskier because of the price impact and uncertainty of liquidating positions.i The breakdown of the auction reset mechanism for municipal bonds is another example of a breakdown of liquidity due to a coordination failure—in this context seemingly rather creditworthy borrowers could not roll over their reset instruments because of doubts about whether the borrower would be able to repay current short-term borrowings due to concerns about the financial status of municipal bond insurers.j The "seizing up" or "freezing" of interbank lending ("LIBOR") markets (e.g., in September 2008) is yet another example of how the collapse of liquidity can reflect a coordination failure.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   During the spring of 2008, the effective collapse of Bear Stearns was viewed by some as resulting from a liquidity crisis in which the firm's short-term funding sources dried up because of potential concerns about the firm's liquidity in the future, spurred at least in part by excess reliance upon such short-term funding sources.k While a liquidity crisis can occur without
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   an obvious reason, these also can result in the asset management context from new or renewed concerns about the creditworthiness of a player. The lack of transparency of holdings and even market pricing can heighten concerns about adverse selection and can lead to fragility of an equilibrium in which shortterm credit plays a prominent role.l With the benefit of hindsight, the solvency challenges facing financial institutions in 2008 became more apparent.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The coordination issue also illustrates the difficulty in starting new futures contracts (e.g., the difficulties in attempting to establish the Shiller macroeconomic housing contracts). Often the potential success of instruments is difficult to forecast—which futures instruments will ultimately prove viable and attract sufficient liquidity can be difficult to discern. In this context, it may even make sense for those with a vested interest in the success and viability of the contract to consider subsidizing trading to build up open interest and volume, thereby mitigating concerns about adverse selection and the eventual viability of the contract.

    Liquidity and Contract and Market Design
   </b>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The specification of a contract as well as the market structure in which it trades can influence the underlying liquidity of that instrument. For example, indexed contracts will face less adverse selection than contracts on individual securities because there is much less scope for private information on an indexed instrument.m The market structure in which an instrument trades also influences the liquidity of the instrument. For concreteness, consider the use of a "call" auction, which aggregates considerable trading activity temporally vs a continuous trading mechanism under which trades are dispersed over time. The continuous mechanism could provide less liquidity than the call auction.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text" class="has-continuation">
   However, not only does the market design influence liquidity, but also the magnitude of potential liquidity can influence the market's design. A simple real estate example illustrates this point. In selling a unique house with many idiosyncratic features, the use of a broker is likely to be advantageous. Yet in selling a condominium for which there are many substitutes and suitable ways for the seller to reach out to prospective buyers, it need not be optimal to hire a broker. In effect, certain properties are so "attractive"
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   that they do not need a broker. That a property can potentially be advantageously sold without a broker adds to its
   <i>
    ex ante
   </i>
   value.n This highlights a potentially important selection difference between the properties sold by brokers and those sold directly; specifically, those being sold through brokers will often be those that are relatively more difficult to sell.

    Concluding Comments: The Transmission of Illiquidity
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Several major financial market crises also illustrate historically some interesting facets of illiquidity from an asset management perspective. For example, illiquidity can spread across asset categories. This occurred in the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis in 1998—part of LTCM's problems arose from a reluctance to sell instruments that were particularly illiquid because those had the largest losses (by definition). Consequently, the asset sales spilled to more liquid assets in order to reduce leverage. A similar phenomenon in the subprime mortgage crisis caused the spreads to substantially widen for prime jumbo loans and for that market to "freeze." More broadly, a by-product of the subprime mortgage crisis was the transmission of liquidity problems across both markets and investors around the globe. The resulting contraction in equity capital in turn led to a "credit crunch" and indeed, various actions of the Federal Reserve Board have been an attempt to cushion the resulting economic shocks.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Another example of the interdependence in liquidity was the fallout in September 2008 from the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The subsequent suspension of liquidity by a major money market fund then led to a "run" on money market funds more broadly (temporarily shrinking by about half a trillion dollars)o and the collapse of the commercial paper market, resulting in both new government guarantee programs to restore "confidence" and a "run" to use open bank credit lines. The various examples in this conclusion illustrate that liquidity is interconnected among assets and can be an aggregate rather than just an asset-specific phenomenon. In fact, historically, at the heart of various financial market breakdowns (including the Great Depression) have been liquidity crises and crises of confidence.

   Somewhat related to this, even the use of short-term secured repurchase agreements to obtain capital became more restricted because of concerns about potential pricing of the underlying collateral in the event of collapse of Bear Stearns, which was a major securities firm, and concerns about the protection afforded repurchase agreements in the bankruptcy process.

   Pete Kyle offered an interesting interpretation of this point at the 2007 FDIC conference, noting that when properties are advertised as "one of a kind" that need not enhance their value, since "one-of-a-kind" properties would tend to require greater costs to resell the property efficiently.

   To avoid slightly analogous problems that would result from "runs" by their investors, some hedge funds began to utilize "liquidity gates" that limit overall outflows during a redemption period. However, such gates can actually heighten the tendency toward a "run" (e.g., to avoid being shut out).
