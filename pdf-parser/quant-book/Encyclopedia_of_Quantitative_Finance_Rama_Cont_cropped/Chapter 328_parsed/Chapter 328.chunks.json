Under the assumption of a linear equilibrium, Kyle [11] derived the unique solution in which the informed investor's trade is a linear function of his/her signal (optimizing an underlying quadratic decision problem) and the pricing at which a competitive market-maker trades is a linear function of the order flow (under the normality assumptions, this reflects a regression that predicts the expected informational cost conditional upon the order flow as the market-maker cannot distinguish an informed order from an uninformed one). The market-maker's (linear) pricing function is such that the cost of trading a position increases proportionately with its size because of the adverse informational consequences of facing a larger order given the decision rule of the informed agent.</p>",

For example, the classic \"no-trade theorem\" in Milgrom and Stokey [13] offers fundamental insights about the nature of illiquidity. The central theorem in [13] is that at a Pareto optimal allocation private signals do not lead to trade. One very simple interpretation that summarizes this conclusion is the \"Groucho Marx joke\": Groucho Marx declared that he would not join any club whose standards were low enough such that he would qualify for membership.c This intuition is closely related to the \"lemons\" idea that underlies the classic work of Akerlof [1]. In the Akerlof [1] setting, potential buyers of a used car are discouraged from purchasing it in light of the seller's private information. Since the potential seller has more precise information on the quality of the vehicle than the buyer, the seller will only sell those types of vehicles that are less valuable to it than the price that the buyer is willing to pay. The buyer's valuation is not based upon the actual quality of car that he is purchasing, but on the distribution of relatively low types that the seller is willing to allow the potential buyer to purchase. In the absence of a substantial difference in preference parameters and valuation between the potential buyer and seller, the presence of private information will lead to a breakdown in this marketplace and the absence of trading and liquidity. This provides a form of the \"no-trade\" theorem. Instead, if the preference differences were sufficient, then some trading (or perhaps even a lot of trading) would arise. If the equilibrium were to support a small volume of trading, then only the lowest quality of cars would be traded. In this context, illiquidity is reflected in low volume (quantity) and low quality arising in the marketplace, that is, most investors do not sell their holdings because they regard the market price as inadequate. For example, the ability of the seller to select specific low-value mortgage-backed securities pools for sale (such as in the context of substantial</p>",

If an asset is relatively idiosyncratic (such as an individual family residence with quirky characteristics), then there is one seller and likely few potential buyers. On the other hand (still within a residential real estate context), some properties may have quite close substitutes (units with similar lay-outs in a high rise condominium or cooperative building) and there could be many potential buyers and sellers. In many market contexts, the level of volume is often viewed as an indicator of liquidity and in the case of futures contracts the extent of open interest would be another such indicator. The connection between volume and prices explicitly arises in several of the key foundational frameworks addressing liquidity issues. For example, in the Kyle [11] framework, a liquid asset is the one in which a modest volume will not move the asset's price very much, so a large volume would be required to move the price substantially. Akerlof's [1] \"lemons\" analysis associates low trading activity with illiquidity as well as low quality of the goods</p>",

For example, liquid assets (such as futures contracts in some contexts) are often used by portfolio managers to adjust or maintain their aggregate exposures (to the direction of the equity market or interest rates), potentially even at relatively high frequencies. Less liquid assets are more appropriate for buy-and-hold exposures. To the extent that an investor owns assets with a range of liquidities, we would expect that the most liquid assets would be sold most often. While lower trading costs would enhance value across the spectrum of potential holding periods, the benefits would be especially pronounced for the potentially most active assets. These effects point to important clientele differences among assets of varying liquidity, which are analogous to clientele effects that differentiate assets that are taxed distinctly. However, just as for all investors (except tax-exempt ones) lightly taxed assets are more valuable than heavily taxed assets, similarly more liquid assets are more valuable than less liquid ones. One interesting theme in empirical asset pricing is that liquidity has emerged as a \"priced\" factor and that assets with higher trading costs provide higher expected returns without excluding the costs.d Much of the focus in market microstructure is in assessing liquidity, informational affects, and trading costs.e</p>",

For example, interest in trading collateralized debt obligation (CDO) structures has waned partially due to the drying up of liquidity in many such marketsâ€”purchasing such instruments became substantially riskier because of the price impact and uncertainty of liquidating positions.i The breakdown of the auction reset mechanism for municipal bonds is another example of a breakdown of liquidity due to a coordination failureâ€”in this context seemingly rather creditworthy borrowers could not roll over their reset instruments because of doubts about whether the borrower would be able to repay current short-term borrowings due to concerns about the financial status of municipal bond insurers.j The \"seizing up\" or \"freezing\" of interbank lending (\"LIBOR\") markets (e.g., in September 2008) is yet another example of how the collapse of liquidity can reflect a coordination failure.</p>",

For example, illiquidity can spread across asset categories. This occurred in the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis in 1998â€”part of LTCM's problems arose from a reluctance to sell instruments that were particularly illiquid because those had the largest losses (by definition). Consequently, the asset sales spilled to more liquid assets in order to reduce leverage. A similar phenomenon in the subprime mortgage crisis caused the spreads to substantially widen for prime jumbo loans and for that market to \"freeze.\" More broadly, a by-product of the subprime mortgage crisis was the transmission of liquidity problems across both markets and investors around the globe. The resulting contraction in equity capital in turn led to a \"credit crunch\" and indeed, various actions of the Federal Reserve Board have been an attempt to cushion the resulting economic shocks.</p>",
