    Convexity Adjustments
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The notion of convexity adjustment (or convexity correction) in fixed income markets arises when one uses prices of standard (plain vanilla) products corrected by an
   <i>
    adjustment
   </i>
   to price nonstandard products.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Many fixed income products are nonstandard with respect to aspects such as the timing, the currency, or the rate of payment. Examples of such adjustments can be found in approximations for pricing formulae of products such as in-arrears or inadvance products, quanto products, constant maturity swaps (CMS) products, or equity swaps. Despite their nonstandard features, these products are quite similar to plain vanilla ones whose price can either be directly obtained from the market or at least computed in closed form. Thus, adjustments of plain vanilla prices can be understood as corrections needed to capture the bias introduced in prices by the complexities of the nonstandard products. Taking this effect into account correctly could provide financial institutions with a competitive advantage. Examples of particular interest for practitioners include

   The yield convexity adjustment is somewhat unrelated to the remaining adjustments, but it is probably the "original one" in the sense that it is related to the nonlinear (and convex) relationship between bond prices and their yield to maturity. The three remaining adjustments have traditionally been separated, both by practitioners and academics, as they concern different classes of products. Various
   <i>
    ad hoc
   </i>
   rules have been proposed in the literature to calculate a variety of convexity adjustments for different products. Many of them are, however, mutually inconsistent. Nonetheless, as we explain later, the last three adjustments can be understood as corrections resulting from the fact that by using quotes of plain vanilla products to price nonstandard ones, we are taking expectations under the "wrong" martingale measure.

   <math display="inline">
    \Phi(T)

   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>

  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \pi(t,\,\Phi) = \mathbb{E}_{t}^{\mathcal{Q}} \left[ e^{-\int_{t}^{T} r_{u} du} \Phi(T) \right]
   </math>
   <math display="block">
    = p(t,T) \mathbb{E}_{t}^{T} \left[ \Phi(T) \right] \tag{1}

   </math>
   -forward measure, respectively, conditional on the information available at time
   <math display="inline">
    t
   </math>
   . When dealing with fixed income derivatives, given the nature of the underlying asset, we are in a stochastic interest rate setting by definition, and, consequently, we are ultimately interested in computing,
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{E}^T_t [\Phi(T)]
   </math>
   , that is, the expected value, under the
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   -forward measure where the
   <i>
    numeraire
   </i>
   is
   <math display="inline">
    p(t, T)
   </math>
   , of our payoff. In the trivial cases, when our payoff turns out to be a
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   -forward martingale, we immediately get
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{E}^{T}_{t}[\Phi(T)] = \Phi(t)
   </math>

   <i>
    not

   the case in most situations. Even if our payoff is not a martingale under the appropriate
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   -forward measure, it could be a martingale under some martingale measure,
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{Q}^{\Phi}
   </math>
   . This is obviously a restrictive assumption, but as it turns out, it includes many popular interest rate products. Suppose, therefore, our payoff is a martingale under the
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{O}^{\Phi}
   </math>
   martingale measure. Then we know
   <math display="inline">
    \Phi(t) = \mathbb{E}^{\Phi}_{t} [\Phi(T)]
   </math>
   , and we can define the convexity adjustment as the term
   <math display="inline">
    CC^{\Phi}
   </math>
   for which the following holds:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">

   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   From the martingale properties of our payoff we get
   <math display="inline">
    \Phi(t) = \mathbb{E}^{\Phi}_{t} [\Phi(T)] = \mathbb{E}^{T}_{t} [\Phi(T) \Lambda(T)],

   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{E}^T_t [\Phi(T) \Lambda(T)]
   </math>
   are the cases where we can say something about convexity adjustment terms
   <math display="inline">
    CC^{\Phi}

   , which is nothing but a side effect of measure changes. For details concerning Radon–Nikodym derivatives and their relation to measure changes, we refer to [6]. In the following, we address each type of adjustment separately.

  <h4>
   Yield Convexity Adjustments
  </h4>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Consider a pure discount bond with maturity
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   . This section is based on a particular "
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   -bond", and to ease up notation we always suppress "
   <math display="inline">
    T

   ". That is, we simply use
   <math display="inline">
    p(t)
   </math>
   ,
   <math display="inline">
    y(t)
   </math>
   , to denote the spot price and yield to maturity of the
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   -bond. One of the most commonly used convexity adjustments results from the nonlinear relationship between the bond's price and its yield to maturity
   <math display="inline">
    p(t) = G(v(t))
   </math>
   . See
   <b>
    Bond
   </b>
   . The exact functional form of
   <math display="inline">
    G
   </math>
   depends on capitalization assumptions, but it is always a continuous and convex function. Given a concrete
   <math display="inline">
    G
   </math>
   , one can define the forward bond yield,
   <math display="inline">
    y_f(t, S)
   </math>
   , as the yield satisfying
   <math display="inline">
    f(t, S) = G(y_f(t, S))
   </math>
   , where
   <math display="inline">
    f(t, S)
   </math>
   is the forward price of a contract written on the
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   -bond and maturing at time
   <math display="inline">
    S
   </math>
   . Without loss of generality, we consider
   <math display="inline">
    t \leq S \leq T
   </math>
   . One way to approximate the price at some future time
   <math display="inline">
    S
   </math>
   of the
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   -bond is to use a second-order Taylor expansion around the
   <math display="inline">
    y_f(t, S)
   </math>
   yield, that is,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We can then take expectations under the
   <math display="inline">
    S
   </math>
   -forward measure to obtain
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \mathbb{E}_{t}^{S} \left[ p(S) \right] \approx f(t, S)

   <br/>
   (4)
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   As
   <math display="inline">
    f(t, S) = \mathbb{E}^{S}[p(S)]

  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \mathbb{E}_{t}^{S}\left[y(S)\right] \approx y_{f}(t, S)

  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   and the second term on the right-hand side (RHS) is what is understood as convexity adjustment in this context. It results from the fact that future yields of
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   bonds are not today's yields from forward contracts on T-bonds.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   A common step to get the convexity adjustment in closed form is to further assume that
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{E}^{S}\left[\left(y(S) - y_{f}(t, S)\right)^{2}\right] = \sigma^{2}y(t)^{2}(S - t).
   </math>
   This adjustment was first proposed in [4, 9] and later sharpened in [8], but it is hard to justify on theoretical grounds. Note that
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{E}_{t}^{S}[y(S)] \neq y_{f}(t, S)
   </math>
   , so
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{E}_{t}^{S}\left[\left(y(S)-y_{f}(t, S)\right)^{2}\right]
   </math>
   cannot be understood as some sort of variance of future yields.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Moreover, the above derived convexity adjustment is an obvious consequence of the Jensen inequality on convex functions, which tells us that for convex G,
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{E}[G(y)] &gt; G(\mathbb{E}[y])
   </math>
   . The Jensen inequality is true under any measure, so, in particular, one could also use futures contracts on
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   bonds. As mentioned earlier, we could define the futures bond yield,
   <math display="inline">
    y_F(t, S)
   </math>
   , as the yield satisfying
   <math display="inline">
    F(t, S) = G(y_F(t, S))
   </math>
   and using the fact that
   <math display="inline">
    F(t, S) = \mathbb{E}^{Q} [p(S)]
   </math>
   we would get
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{E}_{t}^{Q} [y(S)] \approx
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    y_F(t, S) - \frac{1}{2} \left[ G''(y_F(t, S)) / G'(y_F(t, S)) \right] \mathbb{E}_t^Q \left[ y(S)
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    y_F(t, S)^2
   </math>
   . Once again, this is hard to interpret, but at least it would have the advantage that futures quotes may be observed directly from the market.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   Finally, it is difficult to justify why the expansion should be around the forward bond yield
   <math display="inline">
    y_f(t, S)
   </math>
   and not directly around today's yield
   <math display="inline">
    y(t)
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   In our opinion, a more sensible way to study the relationship between a
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   -bond price and its yield to maturity is to derive it directly from the dynamics of bond prices. For any risk-neutral "
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   -bond" dynamics
   <math display="inline">
    dp(t) = r_t p(t) dt + v_t p(t) dW_t^Q
   </math>
   , no arbitrage arguments allow us to obtain the exact relationship. For instance, in the continuously compounded yield case, we get
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \mathbb{E}_{t}^{\mathcal{Q}}\left[y(\mathcal{S})\right] = y(t) - \frac{p(t,\mathcal{S}) - \mathbb{E}_{t}^{\mathcal{Q}}\left[\frac{1}{2}\int_{t}^{\mathcal{S}} v_{u}^{2} du\right]}{T - \mathcal{S}}\tag{6}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    p(t, S)
   </math>
   , as above, denotes the price at time t of an S-bond. The second term on the left-hand side (LHS) can be understood as a convexity correction, and for any deterministic volatility of bond prices it can be computed in closed form. In particular, this is true for any affine model.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Forward/Futures Adjustments
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A second type of convexity adjustment occurs when we are interested in quoting forward prices on any given underlying while having available futures prices on the same underlying. Recall (see Forwards and Futures) that the difference between futures and forward prices results from the correlation between the underlying to the financial contract and the spot interest rate. As mentioned in [12], this correlation, capitalized by the margin calls of the futures contract, leads to a more expensive (respectively cheaper) futures contract in the case of positive (respectively negative) correlation. Let us denote by
   <math display="inline">
    f(t, T)
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    F(t, T)
   </math>
   the forward and futures prices for contracts with maturity
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   on any underlying, respectively. It is a well-known fact that forward prices with maturity
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   are martingales under the
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   -forward martingale measure, while futures prices are martingales under the
   <math display="inline">
    Q
   </math>
   risk-neutral measure. For further reading on forward martingale measures, we refer to [1]. The difference in both prices occurs only in a stochastic interest rate setting and is therefore of particular importance when dealing with fixed income products and derivatives. For concrete examples on the difference between futures and forward term structures in a quite general setting (including any affine model), we refer to
   <math display="inline">
    [5]
   </math>
   .
  </p>
  <h4>
   Timing Adjustments
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   This third cause of adjustment occurs when an interest rate derivative is structured so that it does not incorporate the natural time lag. Examples of products with modified schedule not only are obviously in-arrears products but also include the case of the CMS rate where the floating rate is in itself a swap rate with a certain maturity, usually higher than the time interval until the next payment. The market practice concerning schedule bias is to distinguish between LIBOR rates related convexity adjustments and swap rate convexity adjustments. We follow market practice and present them separately.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   LIBOR Convexity Adjustments. The forward LIBOR rate
   <math display="inline">
    L(t, T_{i-1}, T_i)
   </math>
   can be expressed in terms of discount bond prices as
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    L(t, T_{i-1}, T_i) = \frac{1}{\alpha_i} \frac{p(t, T_{i-1}) - p(t, T_i)}{p(t, T_i)} \tag{7}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    \alpha_i = T_i - T_{i-1}
   </math>
   . Spot LIBOR rates can be defined in terms of the forward ones as
   <math display="inline">
    L(t, T) =
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    L(t, t, T)
   </math>
   . From the above expression, one can easily see the forward LIBOR rate
   <math display="inline">
    L(t, T_{i-1}, T_i)
   </math>
   is a martingale under the forward martingale measure
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{Q}^{T_i}
   </math>
   . Thus, we can price future LIBOR-dependent payments due at
   <math display="inline">
    T_i
   </math>
   , using equation (1) and forward LIBOR rates quoted today as we have
   <math display="inline">
    \mathbb{E}^{T_i}_t[L(T_{i-1},
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    [T_i] = \mathbb{E}_t^{T_i} [L(T_{i-1}, T_{i-1}, T_i)] = L(t, T_{i-1}, T_i).
   </math>
   This is the case in standard swap contracts, for instance.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   However, in LIBOR-in-arrears (LIA) contracts, the LIBOR payment is due in advance, at time
   <math display="inline">
    T_{i-1}

  <p block-type="Equation">

  <p block-type="Text">
   In this particular case, the measure change that we are interested in occurs between two forward measures and we have

   <math display="block">
    = \frac{\alpha_{i} \text{Var}_{t} \left[ L(T_{i-1}, T_{i}) \right]}{1 + \alpha_{i} L(t, T_{i-1}, T_{i})} \tag{10}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   This is valid irrespective of the distribution that we assume for the forward LIBOR rates. Moreover, it only depends on its variance, which is the same under any equivalent martingale measure. Reference [15] provides exact LIA convexity adjustments based upon the assumption of lognormal LIBOR rates as in LIBOR market models (see LIBOR Market
   <b>
    Model
   </b>
   ). In that particular case, we get

  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \mathbb{E}_{t}^{T_{i}}\left[S(T_{i-1}, T_{i}, T_{i+c})\right] = S(t, T_{i}, T_{i+c}) + CC^{\text{CMS}}(t)

   <math display="block">
    CC_{t}^{\text{CMS}} = \frac{P(t, T_{i}, T_{i+c})}{p(t, T_{i})} \times \mathbb{E}_{t}^{\mathcal{S}} \left[ S(T_{i-1}, T_{i}, T_{i+c}) \frac{p(T_{i-1}, T_{i})}{P(T_{i-1}, T_{i}, T_{i+c})} \right] - S(t, T_{i}, T_{i+c}) \tag{13}

   This is not easy to obtain in closed form. Most CMS convexity adjustment formulas can only be obtained in an approximative way. A common practice at this

   <math display="inline">
    p(t, T_i)/P(t, T_i, T_{i+c})

   . This linearity assumption is a crude one, but it yields better results in practice than one would expect. The reason for this is that convexity adjustments only become sizable for long maturities, and, for those maturities the term structure movements tend to be parallel. Thus, they are well captured by a linear model.

   is a popular paper on convexity adjustments of CMS swaps, caps, and floors that follows this line. The author analyzes three basic term structure models, starting from a standard yield curve model and continuing to more sophisticated models, which account for nonparallel shifts and continuous time compounding of interest rates. This is equivalent to assuming particular functional forms for the

   The method proposed in

   includes the LSM as a special case, in which the first-order Taylor approximation is, in fact, exact. Depending on the underlying dynamics for the swap rate, the formulas may be quite evolved, but the paper [16] provides hope for nice formulas in the affine term structure setup.

  <h4>
   Quanto Adjustments
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   So far, we have discussed timing adjustments. Quanto products refer to products with an underlying expressed in one currency and payment in a different currency. Quanto adjustments are adjustments that try to correct for payment in the "wrong currency" versus the "wrong timing". We can have quanto (diff) swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, CMS rates, barrier options, equity swaps, and so on. For an overview of existing quanto products, see Quanto Options.
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   As explained in [14], a convexity adjustment of this type occurs when our product is a martingale under the foreign risk-neutral measure, but needs to be priced under the domestic risk-neutral measure. As an example, we shall use a diffed LIBOR contract, that is, a contract where the foreign LIBOR rate
   <math display="inline">
    L^f(T_{i-1},T_i)
   </math>
   is observed at
   <math display="inline">
    T_{i-1}
   </math>
   and is paid in domestic currency at time
   <math display="inline">
    T_i
   </math>
   . This contract can serve as the floating payment for a differential swap (also known as
   <i>
    diff swap
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    quanto swap
   </i>
   ), and it is made against a fixed payment in domestic currency. We know that the forward LIBOR rate
   <math display="inline">
    L^{f}(t, T_{i-1}, T_{i})
   </math>
   is a martingale under the foreign
   <math display="inline">
    T_i
   </math>
   forward measure
   <math display="inline">
    Q^{f,T_i}
   </math>
   , so
   <math display="inline">
    L^f(t,T_{i-1},T_i) = \mathbb{E}_t^{f,T_i}[L^f(T_{i-1},T_i)],
   </math>
   but we need to compute the expectation of the foreign LIBOR rate under the domestic forward measure. Under that measure we know
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    \mathbb{E}_{t}^{d,T_{i}}[L^{f}(T_{i-1},T_{i})] = L^{f}(t,T_{i-1},T_{i}) + CC^{\text{diff}}(t)
   </math>
   (15)
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   and this type of convexity adjustment is given by
  </p>
  <p block-type="Equation">
   <math display="block">
    CC^{\text{diff}}(t) = \frac{\mathbb{E}_{t}^{f, T_{i}}[L^{f}(T, T_{i})F(T_{i-1}, T_{i})]}{F(t, T_{i})} - L^{f}(t, T_{i-1}, T_{i}) \tag{16}
   </math>
  </p>
  <p block-type="TextInlineMath" class="has-continuation">
   where
   <math display="inline">
    F(t, T_i)
   </math>
   is the forward exchange rate
   <math display="inline">
    (f/d)
   </math>
   , quoted at t and with delivery at
   <math display="inline">
    T_i
   </math>
   . The convexity correction for quanto products will typically depend on the correlation between the foreign interest rate and the exchange rate. If, in the above example, both the forward LIBOR and the forward exchange rates have lognormal distributions under
   <math display="inline">
    Q^{f,T_i}
   </math>
   as proposed in [11], one can easily derive the convexity adjustment formula as
   <math display="inline">
    CC^{\text{diff}}(t) =
   </math>
   <math display="inline">
    L^f(t,T_{i-1},T_i)

    \left[e^{\rho_{F,L}\sigma_L\sigma_F(T_{i-1}-t)}-1\right]
   </math>
   , where
   <math display="inline">
    \rho_{F,L}
   </math>
   is the instant correlation between the LIBOR and the forward exchange rate,
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_L
   </math>
   is the volatility of the LIBOR,
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   and
   <math display="inline">
    \sigma_F
   </math>
   is the volatility of the forward exchange rate, assumed to be constant.
