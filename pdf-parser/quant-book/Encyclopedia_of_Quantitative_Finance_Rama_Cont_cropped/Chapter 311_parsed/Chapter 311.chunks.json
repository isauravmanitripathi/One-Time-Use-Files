It is slightly ironic that nonstatistical techniques increasingly have come to be relied upon as tools for overcoming the deficiencies in VaR, signaling an (implicit) rejection of a risk epistemology based on objective principles and deductive reasoning in favor of a subjective alternative reliant on inductive reasoning. The prescriptions of regulatory authorities have added significant impetus to this trend. Partly as a result of this exogenous motivating force, these tools have experienced an incomplete ontogeny. Although various mathematical techniques of stress testing and scenario analysis have been developed, an axiomatic treatment justifying the incorporation of these tools into economic decision making is still missing.</p>",

For example, the document states, \"Banks should subject their portfolios to a series of simulated stress scenarios <i>...</i> for example, the 1987 equity crash, the ERM crises of 1992 and 1993, or the fall in the bond markets in the first quarter of 1994.\" The perceived importance of these techniques continues to wax large in the regulatory agenda. For example, in 2006 the Committee of European Banking Supervisors issued a consultative paper on stress testing in which it opined, \"Stress testing is a valuable risk management technique whose potential applications are quite varied <i>...</i>\" A comprehensive system of stress testing and scenario analysis is generally a required concomitant to risk-based methods for regulatory capital adequacy determination.</p>",

It has also been shown that a coherent risk measure can be obtained from scenarios. These results place scenario analysis squarely within the framework of risk theory. In limited contexts, it is possible to construct decision-theoretic justifications for rules based on stress scenarios. The key element in so doing is the ability to completely specify the event space of portfolio outcomes. This can be accomplished selfreferentially, as when a decision maker, regulator, and so on, defines the set of relevant outcomes, where any other outcome not included in (or derivable from) this set of predefined outcomes is ignored or declared irrelevant. A widely cited example is the Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN) margining system used by many derivatives exchanges in which a given set of scenarios is deemed to be relevant for determining capital adequacy for a market participant.</p>",
