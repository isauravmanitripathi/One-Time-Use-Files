    Commodity Price Models
   </b>
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Arbitrage models of commodity prices are relative pricing devices. They allow market operators to evaluate commodity-linked securities in terms of
   <i>
    quoted
   </i>
   commodity prices or indices. Spark and crack spread options, multicommodity basket options, swing contracts, and collateralized commodity obligations are just a few examples of financial securities that can be priced (and thus hedged) using commodity models [17]. Moreover, the valuation of certain real assets may benefit from the use of these models. That is the case of long-term investments in natural resources, which can be interpreted as real (
   <i>
    vs
   </i>
   . financial) options written on the value of the corresponding commodity price(s) [37].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Models differ in the
   <i>
    primitives
   </i>
   from which prices of more complex positions can be derived and in the way the stochastic dynamics of these building blocks is described. As a consequence, model selection mainly depends on the level of development characterizing the market under consideration. For instance, oil markets are rather mature; they provide traders with a large quantity of reliable quotes for futures as well as vanilla options; these prices may thus be considered as model primitives. On the contrary, several electricity markets quote spot prices only, which then constitute candidate primitives for valuation purposes.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   We begin by deriving the most important commodity valuation formula based on arbitrage considerations; then, we consider four major classes of commodity price models, each one gathering models sharing a common set of primitives; finally, we address a number of modeling issues underlying the design of risk management systems for commodity portfolios.

    Net convenience revenue
   </i>
   is defined as the sum of all benefits (e.g., saved costs of shortage, consumption value, and other side cash flows) minus the sum of all costs (e.g., storage expenses and replacement costs for perishable goods) stemming from physically holding a storable commodity over a period of time [8]. For the purpose of pricing forward contracts, which represent the simplest class of commodity derivatives, net convenience revenue must be computed net of the risk-free rate of interest on the currency of denomination representing the purely financial cost of funding the operation. This

   </i>
   for a price
   <i>
    x(t)

   , it represents a cash flow occurring at time

   In contrast to hypothesis 1, some markets (e.g., oil) do not quote prices for spot delivery. In this case, we may either identify spot with the shortest maturity forward, or simply avoid considering spot prices and focus on forward curve models, whereby forward prices are model primitives and the spot is a derived quantity. As opposed to assumption 2, a few markets (e.g., electricity and shipping freight) quote forwards for delivery over a whole time period. A possible way out consists in finding implied forward prices compatible to the existing market quotes [28]. As far as assumption 3 is concerned, some commodities (e.g., electricity) cannot be stored. This fact prevents traders from performing a cash-and-carry strategy in the way described earlier, which may lead to denying the validity of the spot-forward parity. However, asset storability is not actually required to derive this relationship. One simply need be able to enter

   If any process between interest rate and convenience yield is stochastic, one has to rely on the general arbitrage pricing formula. This formula states that the fair value of a financial security is the risk-neutral expected value of the sum of all discounted future cash flows going to the holder. In a diffusion model setting, risk neutrality operatively translates into a price drift
   <math display="inline">
    \mu_{S}^{*}(t)

   <b>

   for details on affine models in the context of interest rates). SC models have been extensively studied in a number of papers, such as [10, 16, 30, 33, 37, 38], among others. Extensions to jump-diffusions can be found in [12] and [22].

   SC models are intuitive in terms of economic interpretation and deliver analytically tractable expressions. However, they experience all consequences stemming from the highly reduced observability of their primitives. First, commodity markets do not quote instantaneous convenience yields. Consequently, filtering techniques (e.g., Kalman) are required to estimate the corresponding process. However, these procedures may deliver an unstable assessment of model parameters, a fact that can undermine the significance of hedging prescriptions resulting
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   from a fitted model. Second, fitting quoted forward curves or term structures of volatility and correlation requires the use of calibration procedures whose effectiveness and numerical stability must be evaluated case by case. Once more, the attention of the modeler is drawn on the nature of the primitives involved in the modeling process. These considerations led a few authors to propose the

   The main benefit from using FD models is that primitives are observable quantities, possibly up to a deterministic transformation of market price data. Moreover, FD models are very intuitive and flexible from a trader's perspective. For instance, they easily allow the user to identify noise terms with a number of forward curve deformations resulting from a statistical analysis of historical market moves. As a result, one obtains a picture of the number of significant noise driving terms as well as the way

   need not be Markovian processes. Jamshidian [24] first derives conditions on the volatility structure, ensuring that the resulting spot price dynamics is Markovian. Unfortunately, this and subsequent results pursued within one-factor Heath-Jarrow-Morton interest rate setting cannot be applied to SC models that involve two-factor Markovian processes. Using the Chevette's technique developed for multidimensional HJM interest rates models, Andersen [1] disentangles abstract Markovian factors underlying forward price dynamics. Alternatively, Roncoroni and Id Brik [36] pursue a systematic study on the direct correspondence between SC models and FD models.

  <p block-type="TextInlineMath">
   from which we deduce that
   <math display="inline">
    c_t(t) = c(t)

   .
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Although formula (10) defines
   <math display="inline">
    c_T(t)
   </math>
   in terms of forward and spot prices, for modeling purposes it is actually used the other way around: processes
   <math display="inline">
    S
   </math>
   and
   <math display="inline">
    c_T
   </math>
   are defined as primitives for a set of maturities
   <math display="inline">
    T
   </math>
   ; then forward prices are derived using expression (10) and drift restrictions are calculated on the
   <math display="inline">
    c_T
   </math>
   dynamics. This methodology defines the forward convenience yield model class (FC models). An interesting application of this setting is represented by the calibration procedure developed in [31].
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Compared to both SC and FD models, this setting has the advantage of clearly exhibiting the contribution of spot price and convenience revenue to the formation of a forward price. FC models suffer from similar drawbacks as those affecting SC models: spot prices may be unavailable in the market under consideration; also, (instantaneous forward) convenience yields are rather difficult to imply from market quotes. In particular, differentiating a term structure of forward prices resulting from fitting observed market quotes may generate a curve exhibiting pronounced spikes because of the instability of the differential operator.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   A final modeling framework is perhaps the simplest and most popular one. The idea is to focus on the fine properties of a particular class of commodity spot prices without assuming any stochastic structure about the underlying convenience yield dynamics. This restrictive assumption is partly offset by the flexibility introduced upon selecting an appropriate spot price process for modeling and pricing purposes. Spot models for energy price dynamics include
   <math display="inline">
    [1, 3, 7, 9,
   </math>
   13, 15, 18, 20, 23, 27, 34, 35], among others. Eydeland and Wolyniec [17] and Fusai and Roncoroni [19] report a large number of examples and references about one-factor commodity price models.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   At the time of writing, there seems to be no general consensus on a benchmark setting for pricing commodity-linked derivatives. As a consequence of the arguments illustrated here, we may suggest for the modeler to focus on primitives, structural elements, and driving noise terms.
  </p>
  <p block-type="ListGroup">
   <ul>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     1. Primitives. They should be selected within the set of market quantities for which reliable data are available. In our view, these may involve an appropriate combination of spot, forward, and swap prices or indices according to considerations of representativeness and liquidity. For instance, a market model for electricity or shipping freight indices may build on average prices as introduced in [5], while the general Markovian FD models framework may provide a model generator more suitable for gas and oil markets.

     <i>
      Structural elements
     </i>
     . A proper form for price drift, volatility, and jump components, if any, should be identified using statistical analysis of historical data and then fitted to observed prices. One may perform a nonparametric estimation of
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   these characteristics and then define an appropriate family of functions reproducing the features displayed by the estimated graphs. Besides representativeness, structural elements ought to be selected in such a way that the resulting model is stable under statistical estimation, a property that goes with the reliability of all valuation assessments and hedging prescriptions stemming from using the model in practice.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   3.
   <i>
    Driving noise terms
   </i>
   . Number and nature of underlying noise terms should be assessed on the basis of historical price analysis (e.g., examination of the trajectorial properties of price paths, principal components analysis) and jump filtering. For instance, a strong deviation of market price returns measured over short-timelagged data should be interpreted as a sign that prices experience shocks of jump nature. Also, slowly decreasing eigenvalues of the historical covariance matrix of forward price returns are an indication of the significance of asynchronous movements affecting forward curve dynamics.
