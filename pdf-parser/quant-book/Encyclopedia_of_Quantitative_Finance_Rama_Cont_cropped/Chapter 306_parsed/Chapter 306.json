The frame was made out of precut pieces of balsa wood, each having been carefully pinned according to the plans along a preprinted arc to obtain the appropriate curvature, and then cemented, piece to piece, with airplane glue. The fuselage was made out of tissue paper, first glued to the balsa frame, trimmed, then dampened with water to shrink it taut, and finally, when dry, lacquered and painted to make it stiff and realistic. The engine was merely a long rubber band that ran the internal length of the fuselage, from propeller block at the nose to tail, wound up by rotating the propeller many times and then let loose to unwind for a flight of perhaps 10 seconds at best. If you were a really ambitious model builder, you followed the instructions very carefully: you were supposed to sand off any excess glue on the frame so as leave no imperfections at all.</p>",

In my case, aged about 10, appearance and flight sufficed. At age three or four, crudely shaped wings, a body, and a throaty airplane engine noise might have been enough. A few years older and I would have wanted a combustion engine and radio control. But, however complex, none of these model Zippys would have been a Zippy.</p>",

A fundamental model consists of a system of principles, usually formulated mathematically, that are then used to draw <i>causal</i> inferences about future behavior. <i>Dynamics</i> and <i>causality</i> are the essential characteristics. A fundamental model, particularly a successful one, is more of a theory than a model. To be a little pedantic, fundamental models proclaim that \"These are the laws of the universe.\" They describe the dynamics in God's terms; they seek to state eternal truths, like Moses descending from the mountain.</p>",

In finance, a model is also a means of translating intuition into dollar values. The apartment-value model transforms price per square foot into the dollar value of the apartment. It is intuitively easier to start from price per square foot (or per room) because it captures much of the variability of apartment prices. Similarly, P/E describes much of the variability of share prices. It is less easy to develop intuition about yield to maturity, option-adjusted spread, default probability, or return volatility than it is to think about price per square foot. Nevertheless, all of these parameters are clearly related to value and easier to think about than dollar value itself. They are intuitively graspable, and the more sophisticated you get, the richer your intuition. Models develop by leapfrogging from simple, intuitive, mental concepts (volatility, for example) to the mathematics that describes it (geometric Brownian motion and the Black–Scholes model) to richer mental concepts (the volatility smile) to experience-based intuition about them to newer models (stochastic volatility models, for example) that incorporate the newer concept.</p>",

Of course, that is not exactly true. Trying to specify \"all circumstances\" reminds me of the 1960s movie <i>Bedazzled</i>, starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. It retells the story of Faust, in which Dudley Moore plays a shortorder cook in a Wimpy's in London who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for seven chances to specify the circumstances under which he can achieve his romantic aims with the Wimpy's waitress he covets. Each time the devil asks him to specify the romantic scenarios under which he believes he will succeed, he cannot get them quite specific enough. He says he wants to be alone with the waitress in a beautiful place where they are both in love with each other. He gets what he wants—a snap of the devil's fingers and he and his mutually beloved are instantaneously transported a country estate, where he is a guest of the owner, her husband, whom her principles will not allow her to betray. In the final episode, he wishes for them to be alone together and totally in love in a quiet place where no one will bother them. He gets his wish: the devil makes them both nuns in nunnery where everyone has taken a vow of silence.

One does not know the truly correct current model, let alone the future one, and so the correct model is uncertain not only in the future but in the present too [3]. The word \"risk\" therefore inaccurately describes the indeterminate nature of financial models.
