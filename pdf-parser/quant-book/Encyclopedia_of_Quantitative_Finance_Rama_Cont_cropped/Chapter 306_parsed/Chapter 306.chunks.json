The frame was made out of precut pieces of balsa wood, each having been carefully pinned according to the plans along a preprinted arc to obtain the appropriate curvature, and then cemented, piece to piece, with airplane glue. The fuselage was made out of tissue paper, first glued to the balsa frame, trimmed, then dampened with water to shrink it taut, and finally, when dry, lacquered and painted to make it stiff and realistic. The engine was merely a long rubber band that ran the internal length of the fuselage, from propeller block at the nose to tail, wound up by rotating the propeller many times and then let loose to unwind for a flight of perhaps 10 seconds at best. If you were a really ambitious model builder, you followed the instructions very carefully: you were supposed to sand off any excess glue on the frame so as leave no imperfections at all.</p>",

It lacked seats, ailerons, proper windows, and doors among many other real-life details, and focused on only a few important features. What features are important depends on the model user. In my case, aged about 10, appearance and flight sufficed. At age three or four, crudely shaped wings, a body, and a throaty airplane engine noise might have been enough. A few years older and I would have wanted a combustion engine and radio control. But, however complex, none of these model Zippys would have been a Zippy.</p>",

In finance, a model is also a means of translating intuition into dollar values. The apartment-value model transforms price per square foot into the dollar value of the apartment. It is intuitively easier to start from price per square foot (or per room) because it captures much of the variability of apartment prices. Similarly, P/E describes much of the variability of share prices. It is less easy to develop intuition about yield to maturity, option-adjusted spread, default probability, or return volatility than it is to think about price per square foot. Nevertheless, all of these parameters are clearly related to value and easier to think about than dollar value itself. They are intuitively graspable, and the more sophisticated you get, the richer your intuition. Models develop by leapfrogging from simple, intuitive, mental concepts (volatility, for example) to the mathematics that describes it (geometric Brownian motion and the Black–Scholes model) to richer mental concepts (the volatility smile) to experience-based intuition about them to newer models (stochastic volatility models, for example) that incorporate the newer concept.</p>",

Of course, that is not exactly true. Trying to specify \"all circumstances\" reminds me of the 1960s movie <i>Bedazzled</i>, starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. It retells the story of Faust, in which Dudley Moore plays a shortorder cook in a Wimpy's in London who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for seven chances to specify the circumstances under which he can achieve his romantic aims with the Wimpy's waitress he covets. Each time the devil asks him to specify the romantic scenarios under which he believes he will succeed, he cannot get them quite specific enough. He says he wants to be alone with the waitress in a beautiful place where they are both in love with each other. He gets what he wants—a snap of the devil's fingers and he and his mutually beloved are instantaneously transported a country estate, where he is a guest of the owner, her husband, whom her principles will not allow her to betray. In the final episode, he wishes for them to be alone together and totally in love in a quiet place where no one will bother them. He gets his wish: the devil makes them both nuns in nunnery where everyone has taken a vow of silence. This is the same difficulty you have specifying future scenarios in financial models—like the devil, markets always outwit you. Even if they are not strictly random, their</p>",

But you cannot perform an infinite number of mental stock price moves with any reliability; the stock, the market and the world are not clearly separable and influence each other, so that the probability distribution of stock prices cannot be accurately known (and may not be time invariant). The history of the world does not affect a coin flip. The history of the world does have a bearing on the next change in a stock's price.

The Black–Scholes model, for example, used to be regarded as adequate for valuing exotic options prior to the market crash of 1987, but is now often replaced by a range of extended models that incorporate local volatility, stochastic volatility, or jumps. One does not know the truly correct current model, let alone the future one, and so the correct model is uncertain not only in the future but in the present too [3]. The word \"risk\" therefore inaccurately describes the indeterminate nature of financial models. If you want to describe this state of ignorance as risk, then do not forget that it is a shorthand term for uncertainty, for something much vaguer than probabilistic risk. There is no ensemble of models each with an associated known probability of being right.b</p>",

      "html": "<p block-type=\"ListGroup\"><ul><li block-type=\"ListItem\"> Many financial phenomena are not mathematically modelable in a useful way. You are worse off thinking you have a model and relying on it than simply realizing you do not, and then allowing for a margin of error.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\"> Since financial models translate intuitive qualities into dollar values, and since financial data are often sparse, unreliable, and unstationary, models should be relatively simple. Complexity in the face of lack of highly detailed knowledge is pointless.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\"> Deal with concepts first, then mathematical formulation, then calibration.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\"> Markets are by definition vulgar, and correspondingly the most useful models are wisely vulgar too, using variables that the crowd uses to describe the phenomena they observe. In physics it pays to drop down deep, several levels below what you can observe (think of Kepler, Newton, Einstein, Schrodinger), formulate an elegant principle, and then rise back to the surface again to work out the observable consequences. In finance, which lacks deep scientific principles, it is better to use models that have as direct as possible a path between observation and consequences. (Of course, over time, crowds and markets get smarter and the definition of vulgarity changes to encompass increasingly sophisticated concepts.)</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\"> Markets learn from experience and proceed to adopt new paradigms and make new mistakes. What is a good model today may be inappropriate tomorrow. Be sure to understand what your model is assuming and what it is ignoring.</li><li block-type=\"ListItem\"> Regard models as interdisciplinary endeavors. Financial models are generally not back-of-theenvelope formulas handed over to \"coders\" to turn into executable instructions. Modeling is multidisciplinary: it touches on the practicality of doing business, on financial theory, on mathematical modeling and computer science, on computer implementation, and on the construction of user interfaces. Models end up as computational computer programs embedded in human and machine interfaces that are themselves computer programs. The risks lie in the knowledge of the business, the applicability of the financial model, the mathematics and numerical analysis used to solve it, the computer science used to implement and present it, and in the transmission of information and knowledge accurately from one part of the model,</li></ul></p>",
