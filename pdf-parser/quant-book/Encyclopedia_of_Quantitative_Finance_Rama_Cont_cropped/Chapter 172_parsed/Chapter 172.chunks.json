A credit rating represents an overall assessment of the creditworthiness of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty, and is thus meant to reflect only credit or default risk. That obligor may be either a firm or an individual. In this way the rating is a forecast, and like all forecasts it is noisy. For that reason, credit rating agencies make use of discrete ratings. The convention used by the three largest rating agencies, namely, Fitch, Moody's, and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) is to have seven credit grades. They are, from best to worst, AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, and CCC using S&amp;P and Fitch's nomenclature, and Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, Ba, B, and Caa using Moody's nomenclature.b As a firm migrates from a higher to a lower credit rating, that is, it is downgraded, it simply moves closer to default.</p>",

Although Fitch and S&amp;P evaluate an obligor's overall capacity to meet its financial obligation, and hence is best thought of as an estimate of probability of default, Moody's assessment incorporates some judgment of recovery in the event of loss. In the argot of credit risk management, S&amp;P measures PD (probability of default), whereas Moody's measure is somewhat closer to EL (expected loss) [9].d These differences seem to remain for structured products. In describing their ratings criteria and methodology for structured products, S&amp;P states the following: \"[w]e base our ratings framework on the likelihood of default rather than expected loss or loss given default. In other words, our ratings at the rated instrument level don't incorporate any analysis or opinion on post-default recovery prospects.\" (44, p. 3). Since 2005, Fitch, followed soon after by S&amp;P and Moody's, have started publishing recovery ratings (each on a six-point scale). Market sector coverage has been different, but expanding, across the agencies. Also, application is different between corporate <i>versus</i> structured products.e</p>",

These are important for obtaining either unsecured credit like a credit card, or even a mobile phone, as well as secured credit such as an auto loan or lease or a mortgage. They have received considerable attention of late in the context of subprime mortgages and their securitization. Nonetheless, because the individual credit exposures are typically small, even considering mortgages, banks have tried to automate the credit assessment of retail exposures as much as possible, often with the help of outside firms called <i>credit bureaus</i>. See [22] for a discussion with application to credit cards, and [1] for a broader survey on retail credit (<i>see</i> <i>also</i> <b>Credit Scoring</b> for a review of credit scoring models).</p>",

Merton recognized that a lender is effectively writing a put option on the assets of the borrowing firm; owners and ownermanagers (i.e., shareholders) hold the call option. Thus a firm is expected to default when the value of its assets falls below a threshold value determined by its liabilities. To this day all credit models owe an intellectual debt to Merton's insights. The best-known commercial application of the Merton model is the Moody's KMV EDF (expected default frequency) model.</p>",

Thus in a pool of 10 000 investment grade obligors or instruments we would expect seven defaults over the course of 1 year. But what if only four default? What about 11? Higher than expected default could be the result of either bad luck or a bad model, and it is very hard to distinguish between the two, especially for small probabilities (see also [29] and <b>Backtesting</b>). Indeed the use of the regulatory color scheme—green, amber, red—which is behind the 1996 Market Risk Amendment to the Basel I, was motivated precisely by this recognition, and in that case the probability to be validated is comparatively large 1% (for 99% VaR) [8] with daily data.</p>",

The precision of the PD point estimates is quite low; there have been no defaults over 1 year for triple-A or AA+ (Aa1) rated firms, yet surely we do not believe that the 1-year probability of default is identically equal to zero.

Carey and Hrycay's [15] study of internal ratings in US banks suggests that such rating systems rely at least to some degree on external ratings themselves, either by using them directly, when available, or calibrating internal credit scores to external ratings. Several books by practitioners and academics with practitioner experience, for example, [18, 30, 38, 41], indicate that the methods used are, perhaps unsurprisingly, much along the lines of the models covered above: statistical approaches—discriminant models in the manner of Altman's <i>Z</i>-score, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, and so on—that make use of firm financials, augmented with a judgmental overlay that incorporates qualitative information. This more intangible information is especially important when lending to small and young firms with no footprint in the capital markets, as shown, for instance, by Peterson and Rajan [39]. Ashcraft [5] documents that the failure of even healthy banks is followed by largely permanent declines in real activity, which is attributed to the destruction of private information about informationally opaque borrowers. There are now some papers emerging that attempt to formalize the incorporation of qualitative and subjective information, for example, from a loan officer, into bank internal credit scores or ratings. See, for instance, [25, 45].</p>",

As correlation increases, so does portfolio loss volatility. The payoff function for the equity tranche is, true to its name, like a call option. Indeed equity itself is a call option on the assets of the underlying firm, and the value of a call option is increasing in volatility. If the equity tranche is long a call option, then the senior tranche is short a call option, so that their payoffs behave in an opposite manner. The impact of increased correlation on the value of mezzanine tranches is ambiguous and depends on the structure of a particular deal [19]. By contrast, correlation with systematic risk factors should not matter for corporate ratings (<i>see also</i> <b>Base</b> <b>Correlation</b> and <b>Modeling Correlation of Struc</b><b>tured Instruments in a Portfolio Setting</b> for details on default correlation modeling).</p>",

First, an \"assumption volatility score\" (or \"V Score\") that would rate the uncertainty of a rating and the potential for future ratings volatility on a scale of 1–5 (low to high). Second, a \"loss sensitivity\" that would estimate the number of notches a tranche would be downgraded if the expected loss of the collateral pool were increased to the 95th percentile of the original loss distribution. Moody's decided to develop these risk measures in addition to rather than in substitution for the standard credit ratings, which are on the same scale as their corporate ratings, precisely to allow investors to make a baseline comparison to other rated securities.</p>",
