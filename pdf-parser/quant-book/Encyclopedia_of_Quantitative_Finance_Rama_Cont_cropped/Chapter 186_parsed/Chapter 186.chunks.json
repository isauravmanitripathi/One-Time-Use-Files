In particular, the telecom bubble and corporate scandals of the early 2000s increased the interest of market participants in products such as credit default swaps (CDS) (<i>see</i> <b>Credit Default</b> <b>Swaps</b>), which provide protection against credit events. In response to this demand for credit protection, credit indices were introduced in 2003, increasing the liquidity of CDS markets. These indices are, in essence, standardized baskets of CDS written on investment-grade and high-yield corporate issuers, or emerging-market governments. Table 1 shows the basic composition criteria of the main indices (more stringent criteria apply too, in particular, those concerning liquidity of the individual CDS). The specific constituents for each index are posted at www.markit.com.</p>",

Similar to CDS, a credit index is a contract which entails that the protection buyer pays a spread (or coupon) at a regular frequency (usually quarterly according to International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) dates) in return for default protection on some notional amount. In case of a default of one of the referenced issuers, the protection seller pays the nonrecovered part of the protected notional times the weight of the issuer in the index. The contract does not terminate, but the protected notional is reduced accordingly. Importantly, the index trades with a fixed spread for each series; changes in market pricing are reflected in the upfront payment required to enter the contract. In contrast, in a standard CDS</p>",

The issuers in the basket are assumed to be homogeneous in credit quality and recovery rate. When deriving the common hazard credit curve for the issuers, the convention is to assume a flat curve (<i>see</i> <b>Hazard Rate</b>). The expected losses are computed from the credit curve, assuming that losses are paid at the end of a coupon period, and given a particular recovery rate. The present value for the index contract is then the difference between the discounted expected losses and the discounted spread payments weighted by the survival probability (since premium is only paid on the remaining protected notional).</p>",

The replicating strategy is not perfect, as the mechanics behind credit indices are slightly different from those for CDS. We mentioned earlier that an index trades with a floating upfront and a fixed spread, whereas most CDS trade with a floating spread and no upfront. This implies that we cannot, in general, enter into a basket of CDS contracts that pay the same spread as the index. And while the basket can be composed without initial capital, the index requires a nonzero upfront investment. After a default event, new differences between the credit index and the basket appear. On the index, the reduction in spread payments is independent of the defaulting issuer; the spread is fixed and only the protected notional changes. On the other hand, the spread reduction for the basket is proportional to the spread on the CDS for the specific defaulting issuer. The index and the basket consequently exhibit different behaviors through time, and offer different sensitivities to interest rates.</p>",
