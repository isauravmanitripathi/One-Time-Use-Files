Therefore, giving a yield to maturity for a bond is equivalent to giving a price for the bond. It should be noted that this is precisely what is actually done in the bond market, where bonds are most often quoted in yield to maturity. While bond yield to maturity is a useful concept, it should be approached with some care, given that it represents a weighted average of discount yields across maturities. Indeed, unless the term structure of interest rates is flat, there is no reason why one would consider the yield to maturity on, say, a 10 year bond as the relevant discount rate for a 10-year cash flow horizon. In fact, the relevant discount rate is the 10-year pure discount (or zero coupon) rate.</p>",

In practice, instead of using the yield to maturity, investors compute the <i>total rate of return </i>on a bond, which is equal to the sum of the difference between the sale price and the purchase price and the coupons reinvested at the interest rate corresponding to each reinvestment period, divided by the purchase price. So as to determine the future reinvestment rates as well as the yield at which the bond will be sold, investors often apply various scenarios of evolution of interest rates (worst case, best case, and neutral scenarios)â€”this is known as <i>scenario analysis</i>. To each scenario corresponds a specific total rate of return.</p>",

If the yield happens to increase, the bond value will decrease, generating (in case of early unwinding) potentially significant losses against which one can choose to be immunized. For this purpose, market participants rely on an interest rate risk measure, whose popularity is inseparable from that of the yield to maturity: duration. This concept, which was developed in 1938 by the American economist Frederick Robertson Macaulay (<math display=\"inline\">1882-1970</math>), only became famous in the bond markets from the 1970s onward, a period precisely characterized by a large increase in interest rates and hence a sharp rise in interest rate risk. Macaulay had realized that a bond maturity was an insufficient measure of its effective life because it effectively took only the final cash flow into account. As an alternative to the outright maturity, he suggested that bond interest rate risk be characterized by the average \"length\" of the bond cash flowsâ€”the so-called <i>Macaulay duration</i> [3]. These days, a more common measure for interest rate risk is the socalled <i>modified duration</i>, which is simply defined as the absolute value of the first derivative of the bond price with respect to its yield, divided by the bond price itself. The Macaulay duration can be computed as the modified duration multiplied by the factor <math display=\"inline\">1 + \\frac{R}{\\delta}</math>. A third measure of durationâ€”the <i>dollar duration</i>â€”equals the modified duration times the bond price. Notice that dollar duration measures directly the change in value for a small change in the yield to maturity, whereas modified duration measures percentage change in value.</p>",

Duration is an appropriate measure of risk for small parallel moves in yield. However, when one wants to quantify the impact of large parallel yield curve moves, it should be accompanied by a secondorder measure, called <i>convexity</i>, which is the second derivative of the bond price with respect to yield to maturity, divided by the bond price. Formally, we can accomplish this by simply adding another term to the Taylor expansion.</p>",
