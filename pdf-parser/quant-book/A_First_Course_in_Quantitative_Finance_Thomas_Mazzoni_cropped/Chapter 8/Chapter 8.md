# **8 Portfolio Performance and Management**

Portfolio performance is usually measured in terms of certain ratios like the Sharpe- or the Treynor-ratio. But there is much more to this subject than just comparing statistics. There are questions like: What proportion of the available capital should be invested in the risky part of the portfolio? This is a matter of optimal money management. Another important question is how future expectations affect today's optimal portfolio decisions. Those are important issues of portfolio selection and control.

# **8.1 Portfolio Performance Statistics**

Assessing the performance of a portfolio is more than comparing past returns over a given time horizon. Imagine two managers of different mutual funds. Both have realized precisely the same annual returns over the last 10 years, but the first one generated only half the volatility in terms of yearly standard deviation, compared to the second one. Which fund would you buy? Which portfolio manager did the better job? Indeed, due to their risk-averse attitude, most people would prefer the first mutual fund, because they conclude from observation that the same expected return is realized with half the risk exposure. This is of course an educated guess, because we cannot guarantee returns and volatilities of both funds not to evolve in a completely different way in the future. The lesson here is that portfolio statistics are always based on past performance and cannot predict the future development of a portfolio. Nevertheless, they can be helpful in gaining or losing trust in the abilities of the portfolio manager. Subsequently, three of the most commonly used performance statistics are introduced.

# **8.1.1 Jensen's Alpha**

Jensen's alpha (Jensen, 1968) is named after the usual Greek letter for the intercept in the linear regression model. Let's focus on the CAPM for the moment. If we estimate the regression coefficients for the return series of an arbitrary portfolio *P*, we get an equation of the form

$$\hat{r}_P - r = \hat{\alpha}_P + \hat{\beta}_P(r_{\rm MP} - r),\tag{8.1}$$

or after rearranging

$$\hat{\alpha}_P = \hat{r}_P - r - \hat{\beta}_P(r_{\rm MP} - r). \tag{8.2}$$

#### **Financial Markets and Portfolio Theory**

In the framework of linear regression, Jensen's alpha is most easily computed from the least-squares estimator,  $\hat{\alpha}_P = \langle e_1 | \hat{\beta}_P \rangle$ , with  $\langle e_1 | = (1 \ 0)$ . In the APT-case we would obtain  $\hat{\alpha}_P = \langle e_1 | \hat{\lambda}_P \rangle$ , with  $\langle e_1 |$  extended to the dimension of  $|\hat{\lambda}_P \rangle$ .

Obviously,  $\hat{\alpha}_P$  represents a kind of extra return above the  $\beta$ -weighted excess return, predicted by the CAPM. We can make this point even more transparent by introducing an estimated extra return  $\hat{r}_X$ , with  $\hat{\alpha}_P = \hat{\beta}_P \hat{r}_X$ , and substituting in (8.1),

$$\hat{r}_P - r = \hat{\beta}_P(r_{\rm MP} + \hat{r}_X - r). \tag{8.3}$$

It is disputable, if such an extra return can be achieved permanently. Of course the market portfolio proxy is never an exact and exhaustive representation of the true market portfolio. But usually it is close enough to prevent  $\hat{\alpha}_P$  from being significantly different from zero. In his original article, Jensen (1968) analyzed 115 mutual funds in the period from 1945 to 1964. He found that the vast majority generated a negative estimate for  $\alpha_P$ , with an average of  $-1.1\%$  after fees. He only found three funds, with alpha statistically significant greater than zero, on a significance level of 5%. But as Jensen pointed out himself, when analyzing 115 funds with true  $\alpha_P = 0$ , one would expect five or six of them to generate a significant result on a 5%-level purely by chance.

There is another possible explanation for a positive alpha. Portfolio managers have to specify an index, against which their fund is to be benchmarked. They are not free to choose such an index, because a high percentage of the securities have to be listed in this index. On the other hand, they are free to include a small proportion of foreign securities, possibly from riskier markets. Those are more volatile and if they realize higher returns, the return series generated by the portfolio supports a positive estimate for  $\alpha_P$ . Thus, Jensen's alpha is also a measure for the selection success.

#### 8.1.2 Trevnor-Ratio

Unlike Jensen's alpha, the *Treynor*-ratio (Treynor, 1966) is inextricably linked to the CAPM. To understand Treynor's measure, first observe that the slope of the security market line (SML) with respect to  $\beta$  is

$$\frac{d}{d\beta} \text{SML} = \frac{\mu_{\text{MP}} - r}{\beta_{\text{MP}}} = \mu_{\text{MP}} - r, \tag{8.4}$$

because  $\beta_{\text{MP}} = 1$  (see Figure 8.1). We can of course indicate a point  $(\beta_P, \mu_P)$  beyond the SML, representing the beta-factor and the expected return of a hypothetical portfolio  $P$ . Assume for the moment that such a violation of the CAPM is possible and call the imaginary line from  $(0,r)$  through  $(\beta_P,\mu_P)$  the portfolio market line (PML). The *Treynor*-ratio is defined as the estimated slope of the PML with respect to  $\beta$ ,

$$\mathrm{TR}_{P} = \frac{\hat{\mu}_{P} - r}{\hat{\beta}_{P}},\tag{8.5}$$

where  $\hat{\mu}_P$  is an unconditional estimate of the expected return of the portfolio *P*. For all practical purposes,  $\hat{\beta}_P$  is the least-squares estimate of the portfolio beta, and  $\hat{\mu}_P$  is the mean of the observed portfolio returns.

![](_page_2_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.1** *Treynor*-ratio as slope of the "portfolio market line" in the µ-β-diagram

# **8.1.3 Sharpe-Ratio**

The *Sharpe*-ratio (Sharpe, 1966) can be motivated in exactly the same way as the *Treynor*-ratio, but in the µ-σ-diagram, not in the µ-β-diagram. Thus, the *Sharpe*-ratio for an arbitrary portfolio *P* is

$$SR_P = \frac{\hat{\mu}_P - r}{\hat{\sigma}_P},\tag{8.6}$$

where µˆ*<sup>P</sup>* and σˆ *<sup>P</sup>* are the usual sample estimators for the mean and the standard deviation of the portfolio return *Rp*. The *Sharpe*-ratio is therefore a completely model independent statistic. It also plays an important role in the economic theory of asset pricing, as we shall see.

As pointed out in the last chapter, the confidence bands for predicted returns can be huge compared to the magnitude of the returns themselves. This degree of uncertainty also affects the reliability of coefficients like the *Treynor*- or *Sharpe*-ratio. One should always keep that in mind, before relying on such statistics too heavily.

# **8.2 Money Management and Kelly-Criterion**

Money management is a concept often more familiar to professional gamblers than to portfolio managers. For example Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund managed, among others, by two Nobel Prize laureates, crashed in 1998 due to massive liquidity problems. Paul Wilmott (2006b, p. 742) even coined the term Short Term Capital MisManagement (STCMM). This is not the only historical example of a disastrous outcome due to poor money management.

You can see the paramount importance of good money management in a very simple example. Assume, you have to decide which fraction π of your wealth *w*<sup>0</sup> to invest in a

#### **146 Financial Markets and Portfolio Theory**

successive coin flip game, where the outcome is in your favor with probability *p*. You either double the amount of your bet, or you lose your wager, independently in each round all over again. Now assume the odds are extremely in your favor, say *p* = 90%. Would you put your whole wealth at stake in a repeated game like this? I suppose not. If you repeatedly put 100% of your wealth in jeopardy, the one unfavorable outcome will eventually occur and you lose everything. That much is easy to see. But which fraction π of your wealth should you choose? That is the difficult question. The answer depends on what objective you pursue. If you are interested in maximizing the expected longterm capital growth rate, then the *Kelly*-criterion (Kelly, 1956) gives the right answer. Let's see how this works in our simple coin flip setup.

# **Example 8.1**

Look at the repeated coin flip game with probability *p*, not necessarily 50%, for the favorable outcome. Which fraction π of the initial wealth *w*<sup>0</sup> should be invested in each

Solution

First examine what happens in the first round. If you win, your wealth is

$$w_1 = w_0 + \pi w_0 = w_0(1 + \pi).$$

If you lose, your remaining wealth is

round, to maximize the long-term growth rate?

*w*<sup>1</sup> =*w*0(1 − π).

It is easy to see that if you have played *N* successive rounds of the game, and say you won *n* of those *N* rounds, your wealth is

$$w_N = w_0 (1 + \pi)^n (1 - \pi)^{N - n}.$$

The order in which you win or lose obviously does not make any difference. The average growth *g* of your capital after *N* rounds of the game is not given by the arithmetic mean, but by the geometric mean

$$g_N = \sqrt[N]{\frac{w_N}{w_0}} = \sqrt[N]{(1+\pi)^n(1-\pi)^{N-n}},$$

or after taking the logarithm on both sides, making it a growth rate

$$\log g_N = \frac{n}{N} \log(1+\pi) + \left(1 - \frac{n}{N}\right) \log(1-\pi).$$

Now remember that we are talking about long-term effects and thus, lim*N*→∞ *n N* = *p*, and

$$\log g_{\infty} = p \log(1 + \pi) + (1 - p) \log(1 - \pi).$$

# **Portfolio Performance and Management**

To maximize this quantity, we have to solve the following optimization problem

$$\frac{d}{d\pi} \log g_{\infty} = \frac{p}{1+\pi} - \frac{1-p}{1-\pi} \stackrel{!}{=} 0.$$

This is easily solved after applying a few algebraic manipulations, and one obtains

$$\pi^* = 2p - 1,$$

which is the *Kelly*-criterion for the simple coin flip game. It is easily shown that the first order condition is sufficient for  $0.5 \le p \le 1$ . For  $p < 0.5$ , you simply should not participate in the game.

Quick calculation 8.1 Convince yourself that the Kelly-fraction of Example 8.1 is perfectly sensible for the fair coin,  $p = 0.5$ , and also for the always winning  $\text{coin. } p = 1.$ 

Let's now turn to a more realistic scenario. Think of a portfolio  $P$  of risky securities. Every day, this portfolio is subject to a randomly driven return process. Let's assume for the moment that daily returns are identically and independently distributed and call the realized return  $r_{P,t}$  on day t. Again, starting with an initial wealth  $w_0$  and a fixed fraction  $\pi$ , the wealth at time T is

$$w_T = w_0 \prod_{t=1}^T (1 + \pi r_{P,t}). \tag{8.7}$$

**Ouick calculation 8.2** Convince yourself that  $(8.7)$  is correct.

By completely analogous arguments to those presented in Example 8.1, we can calculate the average growth of capital by the geometric mean

$$g_T = \sqrt[T]{\frac{w_T}{w_0}} = \sqrt[T]{\prod_{t=1}^T (1 + \pi r_{P,t})}.$$
 (8.8)

Let's proceed further with our analogy and calculate the average growth rate of the portfolio by taking logarithms

$$\log g_T = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log(1 + \pi r_{P,t}). \tag{8.9}$$

Now realize that the right hand side of  $(8.9)$  is the usual arithmetic mean, and in the limit  $T \rightarrow \infty$  we obtain

$$\log g_{\infty} = E[\log(1 + \pi R_P)]. \tag{8.10}$$

147

#### **148 Financial Markets and Portfolio Theory**

The next step is to *Taylor*-expand the logarithm in (8.10). As usual, we assume that on average daily returns are positive but very small, *E*[*RP*] = µ*<sup>P</sup>* ≪ 1, such that *E*[*R* 2 *P* ] ≈ Var[*RP*] =σ 2 *P* holds. Expanding to second order, one obtains

$$\log g_{\infty} \approx E \Big[ \log 1 + \pi R_P - \frac{1}{2} \pi^2 R_P^2 \Big] \approx \pi \mu_P - \frac{1}{2} \pi^2 \sigma_P^2. \tag{8.11}$$

All that is left to do is to set the derivative of (8.11) with respect to π equal to zero, and to calculate the *Kelly*-fraction for the portfolio problem

$$\pi^* = \frac{\mu_P}{\sigma_P^2}.\tag{8.12}$$

**Quick calculation 8.3** Verify the *Kelly*-criterion (8.12) for the portfolio problem.

# **Example 8.2**

Assume you have the opportunity to invest in a mutual fund that offers an expected return of 5% per year and a standard deviation of 31.63%. Trading is only on a daily basis (250 trading days per year). What is the *Kelly*-fraction and what yearly capital growth rate can you expect?

# Solution

The first thing to do is to convert the mean and standard deviation into daily quantities

$$\mu_P = \frac{5\%}{250} = 0.02\%$$
 and  $\sigma_P = \frac{31.63\%}{\sqrt{250}} = 2\%.$ 

From this we get immediately the *Kelly*-fraction

$$\pi^* = \frac{\mu_P}{\sigma_P^2} = \frac{0.02\%}{0.04\%} = \frac{1}{2}.$$

Plugging this ratio into the long-term average growth rate (8.11) yields

$$\log g_{\infty}^* = \pi^* \mu_P - \frac{1}{2} \pi^{*2} \sigma_P^2 = \frac{\mu_P^2}{2\sigma_P^2} = 0.005\%.$$

Finally, reconverting this growth rate into yearly terms yields an average capital growth rate of 1.25%.

........................................................................................................................

Example 8.2 indicates that the average long-term growth rate of capital is significantly smaller than the expected return of the portfolio. This is partly due to the fraction invested in the fund, which is one half in this case. But there is another effect, best

![](_page_6_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.2** *Kelly*-criterion for the portfolio problem

understood in a heuristic way. Assume you invested an arbitrary amount of money *w*<sup>0</sup> at time *t* = 0. The return at *t* = 1 is 10% and the return at *t* = 2 is −10%. What does your account look like after the second day? You might be tempted to say it is still *w*0, because you realized a loss and a gain in capital of the same magnitude, but this is not correct. The right answer is

$$w_2 = w_0(1+0.1)(1-0.1) = w_0(1^2-0.1^2) = 0.99w_0.$$
 (8.13)

You have indeed realized a loss of 1% after the second day. This may seem utterly unfair, but such is life.

It gets even worse. If you plot the average long-term growth rate against the *Kelly*fraction, as in Figure 8.2, it becomes evident that if you willingly or by accident go beyond double-*Kelly*, you only can expect capital losses. In reality most of the time you do not know the parameters µ*<sup>P</sup>* and σ*P*, but have to estimate them from a finite sample of past realizations. Conservative investors therefore often try to invest a half-*Kelly* fraction, because the expected growth rate is still 3µ 2 *P* /8σ 2 *P* , but there is a comfortable margin for error before you enter the danger zone. For investments in ordinary securities or stock indices, the *Kelly*-fraction is most of the time something between one half and one, ruling out all kinds of leveraged strategies.

Finally, returning to our initial discussion of Long Term Capital Management, one may conclude from the analysis of their positions, that they were highly over-leveraged. As pointed out by Wilmott (2006b, p. 741), just their notional position in swaps was \$1.25 trillion, which was 5% of the entire market volume at that time, providing a leverage ratio of more than 20:1. It has been estimated that they were committed to about double-*Kelly*.

# **8.3 Adjusting for Individual Market Views**

By now it should be clear that managing a portfolio requires strategic decisions. Maybe the simplest decision of this kind is to choose a buy and hold strategy. This is by no means a dull strategy, because we saw earlier that there is no convincing evidence that managed funds are able to beat their reference index over an extended period of time. Last but not least, this was one of the favorite strategies of the Hungarian stock market wizard André Kostolany. The next more challenging strategy could be to modify the portfolio composition such that in times of bullish market perspectives, the portfolio beta is considerably larger than one, and in bearish periods the beta is smaller than one. With this strategy you should on average participate stronger in market upturns than the index, but weaker in downturns. The problem in both strategies is to decide what the perspective of a single security, or the whole market, respectively, is. This is the point, where individual expectations and beliefs come in. As we shall see, there is a way to combine such individual views in an optimal way with the information the market has provided so far.

The first to consider individual views in the portfolio selection decision were Black and Litterman (1992). Their goal was to improve the estimator for the expected return of an arbitrary asset, provided by an equilibrium model like the CAPM, by incorporating information from individual investors' views. As pointed out by Meucci (2010a), processing the return estimators results in two puzzles with respect to scenario analysis and completely uninformative views. To avoid these kinds of problems, we consider here what is called the market formulation of the *Black–Litterman*-approach by Meucci. This modification is more general and completely consistent.

Departing from a given distribution of an *N*-dimensional vector of market returns |*R*⟩ ∼ *N* ( |µ⟩, Σ ) , assume that an investor has individual views on the future outcome of some of these random returns

$$|V\rangle = P|R\rangle + |\epsilon\rangle,\tag{8.14}$$

where *P* is a *K* × *N* "pick"-matrix. The random error |ϵ⟩ associates uncertainty with the views |*V*⟩, and is assumed to be independently

$$|\epsilon\rangle \sim N(|0\rangle, \Omega) \tag{8.15}$$

distributed, where Ω is a *K* × *K* covariance matrix. A convenient choice for Ω is

$$\Omega = \frac{1}{c} P \Sigma P',\n$$
(8.16)

with *c* representing an overall confidence parameter. For *c* → 0, the variance of |ϵ⟩ grows to infinity, which renders the views completely uninformative, whereas *c* → ∞ expresses complete confidence, in which case we are in fact doing scenario analysis.

**Quick calculation 8.4** Convince yourself that with (8.16), Ω = <sup>1</sup> *c*Var[ *P*|*R*⟩ ] holds.

By now you should have two questions about what we have said so far. The first is, what is the pick-matrix exactly and how is it applied to express a particular view? The

### **Portfolio Performance and Management**

second is, how does this framework help us at all? So let's answer the first question by an example.

# Example 8.3

Assume that there are only four securities relevant to us, and that we have the following views on their future returns

$$\begin{pmatrix}\n8\% \\
2\% \\
\end{pmatrix} = \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\
\end{pmatrix}}_{P} |R\rangle + |\epsilon\rangle.$$

What information is provided by the pick-matrix?

## Solution

The first row of P picks only the return of the first security out of  $|R\rangle$  and assigns an individual prediction of 8% to its return. The second row picks the difference in returns of the second and the fourth security, and predicts this difference to be 2%. Note that there is no view about the return of the third security, neither absolute, nor relative.

To answer the second question we have to use the concept of conditional distributions. Let  $\mathcal{F}_R$  be the  $\sigma$ -algebra, generated by observing the return  $|R\rangle = |r\rangle$ , and realize that the distribution of  $|V\rangle$ , conditional on the information  $\mathcal{F}_R$ , is

$$|V\rangle|\mathcal{F}_R \sim N(P|r\rangle, \Omega). \tag{8.17}$$

But this is not the interesting one. What we are looking for is the distribution of  $|R\rangle$ , conditional on the views to attain a particular value  $|V\rangle = |v\rangle$ . In Example 8.3, we had 2%). The conditional distribution  $|R\rangle|\mathcal{F}_V$  can be calculated with the help  $\langle v| = (8\%$ of Bayes' rule. For any two continuous random variables X and Y, the conditional probability density of  $X|\mathcal{F}_Y$  is given in shorthand notation by

$$f(x|y) = \frac{f(y|x)f(x)}{f(y)}.\t(8.18)$$

We know by definition that the distribution of  $|R\rangle$  is *Gaussian*, and also the conditional distribution of  $|V\rangle|\mathcal{F}_R$  is *Gaussian*. But the unconditional distribution of  $|V\rangle$  is also *Gaussian*, because  $|V\rangle$  is by (8.14) a linear combination of *Gaussian* random variables. That means, we know all density functions on the right hand side of  $(8.18)$  and we can conduct the cumbersome computation of  $f(x|y)$ .

There is, however, an elegant shortcut to this computation. Realizing that in our case  $f(y|x)f(x) = f(y, x)$  is the joint normal probability density of Y and X means that we can apply the normal correlation theorem (Theorem 3.1 on page 56). It states that the conditional distribution of  $X|\mathcal{F}_Y$  is also normal with expectation value

$$E[X|\mathcal{F}_Y] = E[X] + \text{Cov}[X, Y] \text{Var}[Y]^{-1}(y - E[Y]), \tag{8.19}$$

### 151

and variance

$$\operatorname{Var}[X|\mathcal{F}_Y] = \operatorname{Var}[X] - \operatorname{Cov}[X, Y] \operatorname{Var}[Y]^{-1} \operatorname{Cov}[Y, X]. \tag{8.20}$$

This is a big step in the right direction. We can conclude that the desired distribution of |*R*⟩|F*<sup>V</sup>* is also a *Gauss*ian. We are merely left with the problem of determining *E* [ |*V*⟩ ] , Var[ |*V*⟩ ] , and Cov[ |*R*⟩,⟨*V*| ] . The easiest one is the expectation

$$E[|V\rangle] = PE[|R\rangle] + E[|\epsilon\rangle] = P|\mu\rangle. \tag{8.21}$$

Next, let's take a look at the variance of |*V*⟩, and keep in mind that |ϵ⟩ is independent of everything else

$$\text{Var}[|V\rangle] = P\text{Var}[|R\rangle]P' + \text{Var}[|\epsilon\rangle] = P\Sigma P' + \Omega. \tag{8.22}$$

Finally, the covariance term is a little tricky. Remember that for arbitrary random variables *X* and *Y* the relation Cov[*X*, *Y*] =*E*[*XY*] − *E*[*X*]*E*[*Y*] holds. Thus, one obtains

$$\begin{aligned} \text{Cov}[|R\rangle,\langle V|] &= E[|R\rangle\langle V|] - E[|R\rangle]E[\langle V|] \\ &= E[|R\rangle\langle R|P' + |R\rangle\langle\epsilon|] - |\mu\rangle\langle\mu|P' \\ &= E[|R\rangle\langle R|]P' - |\mu\rangle\langle\mu|P' \\ &= \Sigma P', \end{aligned} \tag{8.23}$$

where we again used that |*R*⟩ and |ϵ⟩ are independent. We are now able to state the posterior expectation vector and covariance matrix under incorporation of the *Black– Litterman*-views

$$|\mu_{\rm BL}\rangle = |\mu\rangle + \Sigma P'(P\Sigma P' + \Omega)^{-1} (|\nu\rangle - P|\mu\rangle), \tag{8.24}$$

and

$$\Sigma_{\rm BL} = \Sigma - \Sigma P' (P\Sigma P' + \Omega)^{-1} P \Sigma. \tag{8.25}$$

We have used in (8.25) that Cov[ |*V*⟩,⟨*R*| ] = Cov[ |*R*⟩,⟨*V*| ]′ .

**Quick calculation 8.5** Can you see why this is true?

Blending views with a prior distribution can be embedded perfectly in the framework of modern portfolio theory (MPT). Let's look at an example for this whole process.

## **Example 8.4**

Consider the four stocks of Duke Energy, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, and Vodafone. The yearly return distribution is assumed normal, and the expectation vector

![](_page_10_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Fig. 8.3** Portfolio composition with (bottom) and without (top) incorporation of *Black–Litterman*-views

and covariance matrix were estimated from data of the years 1993 to 2013,

$$|\mu\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 10.9\% \\ 14.3\% \\ 23.9\% \\ 17.2\% \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \Sigma = 10^{-2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 6.74 & 3.33 & -1.2 & 1.69 \\ 3.33 & 8.51 & -3.1 & -4.8 \\ -1.2 & -3.1 & 20.2 & 13.1 \\ 1.69 & -4.8 & 13.1 & 16.8 \end{pmatrix}$$

Assume further that utility is represented by the standard parametric family (6.51) from MPT

$$U_{\alpha}[R_P] = \mu_P - \frac{\alpha}{2}\sigma_P^2.$$

How does the optimal portfolio composition change, if the views of Example 8.3 are incorporated, the confidence parameter is *c* = 2, and short selling is prohibited?

### Solution

From (6.57) on page 115 one obtains the optimal portfolio weights

$$|w_{\alpha}^{*}\rangle = \Sigma^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}|\mu\rangle + \frac{1}{c}\left(1 - \frac{b}{\alpha}\right)|1\rangle\right),\,$$

with *b* = ⟨1|Σ −1 |µ⟩ and *c* = ⟨1|Σ −1 |1⟩. In order to satisfy the short selling constraint, negative weights are set to zero and the optimization is carried out again with respect to the remaining nonzero weights.

The posterior moments, incorporating the views of Example 8.3, are calculated according to (8.24) and (8.25) with confidence parameter *c* = 2. One obtains

Figure 8.3 shows the portfolio composition for the prior (reference) model (top) and the posterior model (bottom), incorporating the views. Obviously, for increasing degree of risk aversion α, the optimal proportion of Duke Energy after including the views is larger than before. All other shares are reduced roughly proportional.

A gentle introduction to trading strategies based on performance indicators is Reghai (2015, chap. 9). For the *Kelly*-criterion consult the original paper of Kelly (1956), and also the very entertaining chapter "Investment Lessons from Blackjack and Gambling" in Wilmott (2006a, chap. 17). Regarding the incorporation of individual subjective views and optimal blending with a posterior distribution, there exists a vast literature beyond the original work of Black and Litterman (1992); see the papers by Qian and Gorman (2001), Almgren and Chriss (2006), Meucci (2006, 2009, 2010b), and the systematic literature survey therein.

# **8.5 Problems**

**8.1** The theoretical information ratio of a portfolio *P* is defined as

$$\text{IR}_{P} = \frac{E[R_{P} - R_{\text{MP}}]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}[R_{P} - R_{\text{MP}}]}},$$

where *R<sup>P</sup>* is the portfolio return, and *R*MP is the return on the market portfolio. Show that this ratio can never be larger than the theoretical *Sharpe*-ratio of the market portfolio, if the CAPM holds.

## **155 Portfolio Performance and Management**

- **8.2** Assume that you can invest a fraction π of your wealth in a portfolio *P* that yields a risky return of *RP*, and put the other fraction 1 − π in a bank account, paying the risk-free interest rate *R*0. Assume that both expected returns, µ*<sup>P</sup>* and *r*, are small of order O(ε), and that terms of order O(ε 2 ) can be neglected. What is the optimal *Kelly*-fraction π ∗ in this case?
- **8.3** In linear filtering theory, |η⟩ = |*v*⟩ − *P*|µ⟩is called the innovation, and Γ = *P*Σ*P* ′ + Ω is the prediction error covariance. The quantity

$$K = \Sigma P' \Gamma^{-1}$$

is called the *Kalman*-filter gain, and the *Kalman*-filter posterior moments are

$$|\mu_{\text{KF}}\rangle = |\mu\rangle + K|\eta\rangle \text{ and } \Sigma_{\text{KF}} = \Sigma - K\Gamma K'.$$

Show that this formulation is equivalent to the *Black–Litterman* posterior moments (8.24) and (8.25) on page 152.

**8.4** Show that for Ω = 0 and invertible *P*, the *Black–Litterman* posterior distribution collapses to

$$|\mu_{\rm BL}\rangle = P^{-1}|\nu\rangle$$
 and  $\Sigma_{\rm BL} = 0$ .

What does invertibility of *P* mean?
