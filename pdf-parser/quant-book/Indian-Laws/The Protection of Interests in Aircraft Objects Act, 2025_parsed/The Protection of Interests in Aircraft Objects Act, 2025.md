#### CHAPTER III

#### DEFAULT REMEDIES

# **Article 8**

#### *Remedies of chargee*

**1**. In the event of default as provided in Article 11, the chargee may, to the extent that the chargor has at any time so agreed and subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 54, exercise any one or more of the following remedies:

(*a*) take possession or control of any object charged to it;

(*b*) sell or grant a lease of any such object;

(*c*) collect or receive any income or profits arising from the management or use of any such object.

**2**. The chargee may alternatively apply for a court order authorising or directing any of the acts referred to in the preceding paragraph.

**3**. Any remedy set out in sub-paragraphs (*a*), (*b*) or (*c*) of paragraph 1 or by Article 13 shall be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner. A remedy shall be deemed to be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner where it is exercised in conformity with a provision of the security agreement except where such a provision is manifestly unreasonable.

**4**. A chargee proposing to sell or grant a lease of an object under paragraph 1 shall give reasonable prior notice in writing of the proposed sale or lease to:

(*a*) interested persons specified in Article 1(*m*)(*i*) and (*ii*); and

(*b*) interested persons specified in Article 1(*m*)(*iii*) who have given notice of their rights to the chargee within a reasonable time prior to the sale or lease.

**5**. Any sum collected or received by the chargee as a result of exercise of any of the remedies set out in paragraph 1 or 2 shall be applied towards discharge of the amount of the secured obligations.

**6**. Where the sums collected or received by the chargee as a result of the exercise of any remedy set out in paragraph 1 or 2 exceed the amount secured by the security interest and any reasonable costs incurred in the exercise of any such remedy, then unless otherwise ordered by the court the chargee shall distribute the surplus among holders of subsequently ranking interests which have been registered or of which the chargee has been given notice, in order of priority, and pay any remaining balance to the chargor.

#### **Article 9**

#### *Vesting of object in satisfaction; redemption*

**1**. At any time after default as provided in Article 11, the chargee and all the interested persons may agree that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.

**2**. The court may on the application of the chargee order that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.

**3**. The court shall grant an application under the preceding paragraph only if the amount of the secured obligations to be satisfied by such vesting is commensurate with the value of the object after taking account of any payment to be made by the chargee to any of the interested persons.

**4**. At any time after default as provided under Article 11 and before sale of the charged object or the making of an order under paragraph 2, the chargor or any interested person may discharge the security interest by paying in full the amount secured, subject to any lease granted by the chargee under Article 8(*1*)(*b*) or ordered under Article 8(*2*). Where, after such default, the payment of the amount secured is made in full by an interested person other than the debtor, that person is subrogated to the rights of the chargee.

**5**. Ownership or any other interest of the chargor passing on a sale under Article 8(*1*)(*b*) or passing under paragraph 1 or 2 of this article is free from any other interest over which the chargee's security interest has priority under the provisions of Article 29.

# **Article 10**

#### *Remedies of conditional seller or lessor*

In the event of default under a title reservation agreement or under a leasing agreement as provided in Article 11, the conditional seller or the lessor, as the case may be, may:

(*a*) subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 54, terminate the agreement and take possession or control of any object to which the agreement relates; or

(*b*) apply for a court order authorising or directing either of these acts.

#### **Article 11**

#### *Meaning of default*

**1**. The debtor and the creditor may at any time agree in writing as to the events that constitute a default or otherwise give rise to the rights and remedies specified in Articles 8 to 10 and 13.

**2**. Where the debtor and the creditor have not so agreed, "default" for the purposes of Articles 8 to 10 and 13 means a default which substantially deprives the creditor of what it is entitled to expect under the agreement.

#### **Article 12**

#### *Additional remedies*

Any additional remedies permitted by the applicable law, including any remedies agreed upon by the parties, may be exercised to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the mandatory provisions of this Chapter as set out in Article 15.

# **Article 13**

### *Relief pending final determination*

**1**. Subject to any declaration that it may make under Article 55, a Contracting State shall ensure that a creditor who adduces evidence of default by the debtor may, pending final determination of its claim and to the extent that the debtor has at any time so agreed, obtain from a court speedy relief in the form of such one or more of the following orders as the creditor requests:

(*a*) preservation of the object and its value;

(*b*) possession, control or custody of the object;

(*c*) immobilisation of the object; and

(*d*) lease or, except where covered by sub-paragraphs (*a*) to (*c*), management of the object and the income therefrom.

**2**. In making any order under the preceding paragraph, the court may impose such terms as it considers necessary to protect the interested persons in the event that the creditor:

(*a*) in implementing any order granting such relief, fails to perform any of its obligations to the debtor under this Convention or the Protocol; or

(*b*) fails to establish its claim, wholly or in part, on the final determination of that claim.

**3**. Before making any order under paragraph 1, the court may require notice of the request to be given to any of the interested persons.

**4**. Nothing in this Article affects the application of Article 8(*3*) or limits the availability of forms of interim relief other than those set out in paragraph 1.

# **Article 14**

#### *Procedural requirements*

Subject to Article 54(*2*), any remedy provided by this Chapter shall be exercised in conformity with the procedure prescribed by the law of the place where the remedy is to be exercised.

#### **Article 15**

### *Derogation*

In their relations with each other, any two or more of the parties referred to in this Chapter may at any time, by agreement in writing, derogate from or vary the effect of any of the preceding provisions of this Chapter except Articles 8(*3*) to (*6*), 9(*3*) and (*4*), 13(*2*) and 14.

#### CHAPTER VIII

#### EFFECTS OF AN INTERNATIONAL INTEREST AS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES

#### **Article 29**

#### *Priority of competing interests*

**1**. A registered interest has priority over any other interest subsequently registered and over an unregistered interest.

**2**. The priority of the first-mentioned interest under the preceding paragraph applies,—

(*a*) even if the first-mentioned interest was acquired or registered with actual knowledge of the other interest; and

(*b*) even as regards value given by the holder of the first-mentioned interest with such knowledge.

**3**. The buyer of an object acquires its interest in it,—

(*a*) subject to an interest registered at the time of its acquisition of that interest; and

(*b*) free from an unregistered interest even if it has actual knowledge of such an interest.

**4**. The conditional buyer or lessee acquires its interest in or right over that object,—

(*a*) subject to an interest registered prior to the registration of the international interest held by its conditional seller or lessor; and

(*b*) free from an interest not so registered at that time even if it has actual knowledge of that interest.

**5**. The priority of competing interests or rights under this Article may be varied by agreement between the holders of those interests, but an assignee of a subordinated interest is not bound by an agreement to subordinate that interest unless at the time of the assignment a subordination had been registered relating to that agreement.

**6**. Any priority given by this Article to an interest in an object extends to proceeds.

**7**. This Convention,—

(*a*) does not affect the rights of a person in an item, other than an object, held prior to its installation on an object if under the applicable law those rights continue to exist after the installation; and

(*b*) does not prevent the creation of rights in an item, other than an object, which has previously been installed on an object where under the applicable law those rights are created.

# **Article 30**

# *Effects of insolvency*

**1**. In insolvency proceedings against the debtor an international interest is effective if prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings that interest was registered in conformity with this Convention.

**2**. Nothing in this Article impairs the effectiveness of an international interest in the insolvency proceedings where that interest is effective under the applicable law.

**3**. Nothing in this Article affects,—

(*a*) any rules of law applicable in insolvency proceedings relating to the avoidance of a transaction as a preference or a transfer in fraud of creditors; or

(*b*) any rules of procedure relating to the enforcement of rights to property which is under the control or supervision of the insolvency administrator.

#### CHAPTER IX

#### ASSIGNMENTS OF ASSOCIATED RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS;

#### RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION

#### **Article 31**

# *Effects of assignment*

**1**. Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, an assignment of associated rights made in conformity with Article 32 also transfers to the assignee,—

(*a*) the related international interest; and

(*b*) all the interests and priorities of the assignor under this Convention.

**2**. Nothing in this Convention prevents a partial assignment of the assignor's associated rights. In the case of such a partial assignment the assignor and assignee may agree as to their respective rights concerning the related international interest assigned under the preceding paragraph but not so as adversely to affect the debtor without its consent.

**3**. Subject to paragraph 4, the applicable law shall determine the defences and rights of set-off available to the debtor against the assignee.

**4**. The debtor may at any time by agreement in writing waive all or any of the defences and rights of set-off referred to in the preceding paragraph other than defences arising from fraudulent acts on the part of the assignee.

**5**. In the case of an assignment by way of security, the assigned associated rights revest in the assignor, to the extent that they are still subsisting, when the obligations secured by the assignment have been discharged.

## **Article 32**

## *Formal requirements of assignment*

**1**. An assignment of associated rights transfers the related international interest only if it,—

(*a*) is in writing;

(*b*) enables the associated rights to be identified under the contract from which they arise; and

(*c*) in the case of an assignment by way of security, enables the obligations secured by the assignment to be determined in accordance with the Protocol but without the need to state a sum or maximum sum secured.

**2**. An assignment of an international interest created or provided for by a security agreement is not valid unless some or all related associated rights also are assigned.

**3**. This Convention does not apply to an assignment of associated rights which is not effective to transfer the related international interest.

### **Article 33**

### *Debtor's duty to assignee*

**1**. To the extent that associated rights and the related international interest have been transferred in accordance with Articles 31 and 32, the debtor in relation to those rights and that interest is bound by the assignment and has a duty to make payment or give other performance to the assignee, if but only if,—

(*a*) the debtor has been given notice of the assignment in writing by or with the authority of the assignor; and

(*b*) the notice identifies the associated rights.

**2**. Irrespective of any other ground on which payment or performance by the debtor discharges the latter from liability, payment or performance shall be effective for this purpose if made in accordance with the preceding paragraph.

**3**. Nothing in this Article shall affect the priority of competing assignments.

## **Article 34**

## *Default remedies in respect of assignment by way of security*

In the event of default by the assignor under the assignment of associated rights and the related international interest made by way of security, Articles 8, 9 and 11 to 14 apply in the relations between the assignor and the assignee (and, in relation to associated rights, apply in so far as those provisions are capable of application to intangible property) as if references,—

(*a*) to the secured obligation and the security interest were references to the obligation secured by the assignment of the associated rights and the related international interest and the security interest created by that assignment;

(*b*) to the chargee or creditor and chargor or debtor were references to the assignee and assignor;

(*c*) to the holder of the international interest were references to the assignee; and

(*d*) to the object were references to the assigned associated rights and the related international interest.

## **Article 35**

## *Priority of competing assignments*

**1**. Where there are competing assignments of associated rights and at least one of the assignments includes the related international interest and is registered, the provisions of Article 29 apply as if the references to a registered interest were references to an assignment of the associated rights and the related registered interest and as if references to a registered or unregistered interest were references to a registered or unregistered assignment.

**2**. Article 30 applies to an assignment of associated rights as if the references to an international interest were references to an assignment of the associated rights and the related international interest.

## **Article 36**

## *Assignee's priority with respect to associated rights*

**1**. The assignee of associated rights and the related international interest whose assignment has been registered only has priority under Article 35(*1*) over another assignee of the associated rights:

(*a*) if the contract under which the associated rights arise states that they are secured by or associated with the object; and

(*b*) to the extent that the associated rights are related to an object.

**2**. For the purposes of sub-paragraph (*b*) of the preceding paragraph, associated rights are related to an object only to the extent that they consist of rights to payment or performance that relate to:

(*a*) a sum advanced and utilised for the purchase of the object;

 (*b*) a sum advanced and utilised for the purchase of another object in which the assignor held another international interest if the assignor transferred that interest to the assignee and the assignment has been registered;

(*c*) the price payable for the object;

(*d*) the rentals payable in respect of the object; or

(*e*) other obligations arising from a transaction referred to in any of the preceding sub-paragraphs.

**3**. In all other cases, the priority of the competing assignments of the associated rights shall be determined by the applicable law.

# **Article 37**

## *Effects of assignor's insolvency*

The provisions of Article 30 apply to insolvency proceedings against the assignor as if references to the debtor were references to the assignor.

## **Article 38**

## *Subrogation*

**1**. Subject to paragraph 2, nothing in this Convention affects the acquisition of associated rights and the related international interest by legal or contractual subrogation under the applicable law.

**2**. The priority between any interest within the preceding paragraph and a competing interest may be varied by agreement in writing between the holders of the respective interests but an assignee of a subordinated interest is not bound by an agreement to subordinate that interest unless at the time of the assignment a subordination had been registered relating to that agreement.

## CHAPTER X

## RIGHTS OR INTERESTS SUBJECT TO DECLARATIONS BY CONTRACTING STATES

### **Article 39**

### *Rights having priority without registration*

**1**. A Contracting State may at any time, in a declaration deposited with the Depositary of the Protocol declare, generally or specifically:

(*a*) those categories of non-consensual right or interest (other than a right or interest to which Article 40 applies) which under that State's law have priority over an interest in an object equivalent to that of the holder of a registered international interest and which shall have priority over a registered international interest, whether in or outside insolvency proceedings; and

(*b*) that nothing in this Convention shall affect the right of a State or State entity, intergovernmental organisation or other private provider of public services to arrest or detain an object under the laws of that State for payment of amounts owed to such entity, organisation or provider directly relating to those services in respect of that object or another object.

**2**. A declaration made under the preceding paragraph may be expressed to cover categories that are created after the deposit of that declaration.

**3**. A non-consensual right or interest has priority over an international interest if and only if the former is of a category covered by a declaration deposited prior to the registration of the international interest.

**4**. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, a Contracting State may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of, or accession to the Protocol, declare that a right or interest of a category covered by a declaration made under sub-paragraph (*a*) of paragraph 1 shall have priority over an international interest registered prior to the date of such ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.

### **Article 40**

### *Registrable non-consensual rights or interests*

A Contracting State may at any time in a declaration deposited with the Depositary of the Protocol list the categories of non-consensual right or interest which shall be registrable under this Convention as regards any category of object as if the right or interest were an international interest and shall be regulated accordingly.
