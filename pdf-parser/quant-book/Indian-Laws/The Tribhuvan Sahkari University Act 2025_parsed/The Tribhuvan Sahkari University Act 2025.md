The University, in the exercise of its powers and functions under section 7, shall ensure that the financial liabilities are met out of the available financial resources and to that extent shall devise and enforce such procedures as approved by any authority referred to in section 20:

Provided that the extant rules and procedures of the Central Government relating to appointments, promotions and fixation of pay as well as expenditures, both recurring and non-recurring, including those referred to in clauses (*viii*), (*x*), (*xvii*) and clause (*xxi*) of sub-section (*1*) of section 7, shall apply if the University seeks any financial assistance or Gross Budgetary Support apart from one-time capital grant.

### STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

In the last three and half years, many new initiatives have been taken by the Ministry of Cooperation to strengthen the co-operative sector, such as Model Bye-Laws for Primary Agricultural Credit Societies making them multi-purpose, multi-dimensional and transparent entities, establishing two lakh new multi-purpose Primary Agricultural Credit Societies or Dairy or Fishery Co-operatives in uncovered Panchayats, World's largest Decentralised Grain Storage Plan in co-operative sector, computerisation of Agriculture and Rural Development Banks, computerisation of functional Primary Agricultural Credit Societies, relief to co-operative societies in the Income-tax Act, 1961, initiatives for the revival of co-operative sugar Mills, establishment of three new nationallevel multi-state co-operative societies for seed, organic products and exports, Co-operative-led White Revolution 2.0 and the like. All these initiatives would generate a huge demand for employment in the co-operative sector.

2. The present education and training infrastructure in the co-operative sector is fragmented and grossly inadequate to meet the present and future demand for qualified manpower and capacity building of existing employees in co-operative societies. It also lacks standardisation and quality monitoring mechanisms. It is, therefore, essential that a comprehensive, integrated and standardised structure is created for education, training and research by establishing a national University to ensure a stable, adequate and quality supply of professionally qualified manpower for different categories of jobs in co-operatives such as managerial, supervisory, administrative, technical, operational, etc., and also address the long pending issue of capacity building of employees and board members in the co-operative sector in a pan-India and focused manner.

3. In view of above reasons, it is proposed to establish a National University in the Co-operative Sector, namely, the "Tribhuvan" Sahkari University. 4. It is also proposed that the Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA) shall be established as "Tribhuvan" Sahkari University through an Act of Parliament and shall also be declared as an institution of national importance therein. Since the University will be established by declaring IRMA, an existing institute, the University shall be functional immediately after the commencement of the "Tribhuvan" Sahkari University Act, 2025. IRMA shall be one of the schools of the University and shall also be declared as a Centre of Excellence for rural management, and its autonomy and identity shall be preserved within the institutional framework of the University.

5. The University would be a specialised University, the first of its kind, in the co-operative sector, to impart and promote co-operative education, training, research and development and thereby strengthen the co-operative movement in the country. 6. The University shall establish sector-specific schools such as dairy, fishery, sugar, banking, rural credit, co-operative finance, co-operative marketing, co-operative accounting, co-operative laws, co-operative audit, multi-state co-operatives, etc., in its campus or in the States that are the leaders in respective sectors. The University shall also create a pan-India network of affiliated co-operative education and training institutes to achieve its objectives. 7. The principles guiding the University in course design, pedagogy and delivery have been enumerated in the Schedule of the proposed legislation. 8. The University shall have at least 4-5 affiliated colleges or institutions in States with a high concentration of co-operative societies and at least 1-2 affiliated colleges or institutions in States with a lesser concentration. The affiliation shall be on a voluntary basis, and the existing co-operative institutes, which are under multiple authorities, shall be encouraged to affiliate with the University.

9. The University, through the Board for Affiliation and Recognition, shall ensure standardisation and quality in affiliated institutes by regulating recruitment of their faculty, resource persons, admission criteria, conduct of examinations, award of degrees or diplomas or certificates, course design and the like.

10. The University shall also leverage existing mass e-learning platforms like SWAYAM. The University shall collaborate with other universities or colleges or institutes or co-operative societies and other stakeholders for research development in the field of co-operation. and

11. The Notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions contained in the Bill.

12. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.
