   STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   In the last three and half years, many new initiatives have been taken by the Ministry of Cooperation to  strengthen the co-operative sector, such as Model Bye-Laws for Primary Agricultural Credit Societies making  them multi-purpose, multi-dimensional and transparent entities, establishing two lakh new multi-purpose Primary  Agricultural Credit Societies or Dairy or Fishery Co-operatives in uncovered Panchayats, World's largest  Decentralised Grain Storage Plan in co-operative sector, computerisation of Agriculture and Rural Development  Banks, computerisation of functional Primary Agricultural Credit Societies, relief to co-operative societies in the  Income-tax Act, 1961, initiatives for the revival of co-operative sugar Mills, establishment of three new nationallevel multi-state co-operative societies for seed, organic products and exports, Co-operative-led White Revolution  2.0 and the like. All these initiatives would generate a huge demand for employment in the co-operative sector.

   2. The present education and training infrastructure in the co-operative sector is fragmented and grossly  inadequate to meet the present and future demand for qualified manpower and capacity building of existing  employees in co-operative societies. It also lacks standardisation and quality monitoring mechanisms. It is,  therefore, essential that a comprehensive, integrated and standardised structure is created for education, training  and research by establishing a national University to ensure a stable, adequate and quality supply of professionally  qualified manpower for different categories of jobs in co-operatives such as managerial, supervisory,  administrative, technical, operational, etc., and also address the long pending issue of capacity building of  employees and board members in the co-operative sector in a pan-India and focused manner.

   3. In view of above reasons, it is proposed to establish a National University in the Co-operative Sector,  namely, the "Tribhuvan" Sahkari University. 4. It is also proposed that the Institute of Rural Management Anand  (IRMA) shall be established as "Tribhuvan" Sahkari University through an Act of Parliament and shall also be  declared as an institution of national importance therein. Since the University will be established by declaring  IRMA, an existing institute, the University shall be functional immediately after the commencement of the  "Tribhuvan" Sahkari University Act, 2025. IRMA shall be one of the schools of the University and shall also be  declared as a Centre of Excellence for rural management, and its autonomy and identity shall be preserved within  the institutional framework of the University.

   5. The University would be a specialised University, the first of its kind, in the co-operative sector, to impart  and promote co-operative education, training, research and development and thereby strengthen the co-operative  movement in the country. 6. The University shall establish sector-specific schools such as dairy, fishery, sugar,  banking, rural credit, co-operative finance, co-operative marketing, co-operative accounting, co-operative laws,  co-operative audit, multi-state co-operatives, etc., in its campus or in the States that are the leaders in respective  sectors. The University shall also create a pan-India network of affiliated co-operative education and training  institutes to achieve its objectives. 7. The principles guiding the University in course design, pedagogy and  delivery have been enumerated in the Schedule of the proposed legislation. 8. The University shall have at least  4-5 affiliated colleges or institutions in States with a high concentration of co-operative societies and at least 1-2  affiliated colleges or institutions in States with a lesser concentration. The affiliation shall be on a voluntary basis,  and the existing co-operative institutes, which are under multiple authorities, shall be encouraged to affiliate with  the University.
