  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   AND WHEREAS, the Hong Kong Convention lays down the aspects relating to design, construction,  operation and preparation of ships so as to facilitate safe and environmentally sound recycling, without  compromising the safety and operational efficiency of ships and the establishment of an appropriate  enforcement mechanism for recycling of ships;
