   STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
  </h2>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The Boilers Act, 1923 (the 1923 Act) was enacted with the objective of ensuring uniformity throughout  India in all technical aspects pertaining to the regulation of boilers. This included standards of construction,  maximum pressure specifications as well as the registration and periodic inspection of all boilers with  particular focus on matters concerning the safety of life and property.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   2. Recently, the Government of India has initiated a comprehensive examination of pre-Constitutional  Acts to assess their relevance and suitability in the contemporary context. In this context, the 1923 Act was  examined and it has been considered necessary to review the provisions of the said Act. As a result, it is  felt necessary, inter alia, to remove redundant or obsolete provisions; introduce certain substantive  provisions to enable framing of the rules and regulations that were previously lacking and to define certain  terms and expressions. These modifications aim to enhance the clarity of the provisions of the Bill.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   3. Therefore, it is considered necessary to repeal the 1923 Act and for that purpose to introduce the  Boilers Bill, 2024 in Parliament. The Bill seeks to provide for the regulation of the manufacture and use of  boilers, ensuring the safety of life and property of persons from the danger of explosions of boilers. It further  prohibits the use of unregistered and uncertified boilers, mandates reporting of accidents and promotes  uniformity in the registration and inspection processes throughout the manufacturing, erection and use of  the boilers in the country. The Bill also proposes independent third-party inspecting authorities for  inspection and certification purposes.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.
