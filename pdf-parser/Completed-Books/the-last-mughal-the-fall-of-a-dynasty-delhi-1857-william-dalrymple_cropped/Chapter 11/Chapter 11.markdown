Brigadier General John Nicholson marched into the British camp on the Delhi Ridge just before breakfast on Friday, 14 August.

With him came 1,000 British troops, 600 irregular horse – all Punjabi Muslims – from Multan, and a British artillery battery; 1,600 Sikh sepoys followed soon afterwards, thus effectively doubling the size of Wilson's small army. But it was the presence of Nicholson himself, rather than the troops that accompanied him, which made the greatest impression on the beleaguered Delhi Field Force.<sup>1</sup> 'Nicholson is a host in himself,' wrote Hodson to his wife. 'The camp is [now] alive at the notion of something decisive taking place.' The normally restrained Charles Griffiths was even more fulsome: 'What added most to our strength was the presence amongst us of the hero John Nicholson,' he wrote.

Many stories are told of his prowess and skill … Spare in form, but of great stature, his whole appearance and mien stamped him as a 'king of men.' Calm and self-confident, full of resource and daring, no difficulties could daunt him. His indomitable spirit seemed at

once to infuse fresh energy into the force … Nicholson's name was in everyone's mouth, and each soldier knew that vigorous measures would be taken to insure ultimate success.<sup>2</sup>

Since leaving Peshawar in May, Nicholson – previously an obscure thirtysix-year-old soldier and civil servant on the North West Frontier, unknown outside his own small circle – had in the course of a few weeks become a legend among the British in northern India. The British, after all, badly needed some heroes after the succession of blunders and insensitivities that had precipitated the outbreak, and the slow, hesitant and bungling response that had allowed it to spread with such speed. Nicholson's mixture of piety, gravity and courage, combined with his merciless capacity for extreme aggression and brutality, was exactly what was needed to put heart into the frustrated British troops sheltering behind their breastworks at the top of the Ridge.

The troops of the Field Force had been worn down by daily attacks for two months now, and were alarmed by stories slowly filtering through of further outbreaks all over Hindustan; by the bad news coming out of the siege of Lucknow and the death of the Residency's great defender, Sir Henry Lawrence; and by the massacre of the British garrison along with their women and children at Kanpur. Most of all they were depressed by the timid incompetence of the senile General Hewitt at Meerut, and that of the frail and elderly Generals Anson, Barnard and Reed, the Field Force's far from dazzling succession of commanders.

For them, Nicholson was the perfect antidote to these tired and nervous old men, and long before he arrived in Delhi stories were already circulating: about the Moveable Column's 46-mile-a-day forced marches; of how while his men rested in the shade, Nicholson would wait 'erect and immobile on his horse in the full glare of the sun', of how he never slept, and at night, when everyone else rested, would sit up writing his letters and dispatches; and of the degree to which Nicholson 'hated sepoys with a hatred that no words could describe'.

Most of all, the British camp was agog with news of Nicholson's recent victory at Trimmu Ghat, where he had, by a series of forced marches, pursued and ambushed an entire regiment of mutinous sepoys from Sialkot who were hastening to Delhi, and having caught them with their back to the River Ravi, made sure that every last sepoy was hunted down, so that 'most

of the sepoys [in the end] sought for safety in the swollen [monsoon-fed] waters of the Ravi and found death, only a very few being captured, and of course shot'.<sup>3</sup> By August, word of the Moveable Column's bloody exploits had reached even Calcutta, where an approving Canning wrote that Nicholson, 'sweeping the country like the incarnation of vengeance, had struck terror into wavering hearts'.<sup>4</sup>

There were very few who remained immune to the hero worship of this great imperial psychopath, but there were exceptions. On the march the young Lieutenant Edward Ommaney was shocked by Nicholson's pointless viciousness: 'He shows himself off to be a great brute,' wrote Ommaney in his diary on 21 July. 'For instance he thrashed a cook boy, for getting in his way in the line of march (he has a regular man, very muscular, to perform this duty). The boy complained, he was brought up again, and died from the effects of the 2nd thrashing.'<sup>5</sup> He was equally horrified by the degree to which Nicholson had given a free hand to his troops to act with extreme violence against their helpless prisoners:

A man of the 2nd Irregulars who showed the Sialkot Mutineers the ford, had his 2 hands cut off, a bayonet run through his body and then hung; batches of prisoners with their hands tied are taken out into jungle and the Sikhs let at them. Such cruelties must tell against us in the long run, and because these men have done the same to us … is no reason that we should emulate them. Kill them by all means by hanging and shooting the really guilty [but the innocent should be spared].<sup>6</sup>

Nicholson also made a bad impression on some of the less brutalised officers on the Ridge. Major Reid, who had borne the brunt of the sepoy attacks with his Gurkhas in Hindu Rao's House, wrote how 'I thought I had never seen a man I disliked so much at first sight. His haughty manner and peculiar sneer I could not stand. He asked several questions as to the enemy's position, and then passed silently on.'<sup>7</sup> Hervey Greathed was also uncertain how to respond to this stern figure, who increasingly came to be seen as the real leader of the Field Force. In the officers' mess on the night of his arrival, Nicholson sat silently throughout the meal with his huge Pathan manservant behind him, 'a cocked revolver in one hand, and

allowing none to hand a dish to his master save himself'.\* <sup>8</sup> As Greathed complained to his wife the following day:

General Nicholson was at dinner. He is a fine, imposing man, who never speaks if he can help it, which is a great gift for a public man. But if we had all been as solemn and as taciturn during the last two months, I do not think we should have survived. Our genial, jolly mess dinners have kept up our spirits.<sup>9</sup>

Immune to any such criticism, by early the following morning Nicholson was out and about, riding around the Ridge, studying the defences, inspecting batteries and breastworks, and beginning to form his plan for capturing the city. 'A stranger of very striking appearance was remarked visiting all our pickets, and asking most searching enquiries about their strength and history,' recalled one soldier.

His attire gave no clue to his rank; it evidently never cost the owner a thought … It was soon made out that this was General Nicholson, whose person was not yet known in camp; and it was whispered at the same time that he was possessed of the most brilliant military genius. He was a man cast in a giant mould, with massive chest and powerful limbs, and an expression ardent and commanding, with a dash of roughness; features of stern beauty, a long black beard, and a deep sonorous voice. There was something of immense strength, talent and resolution in his whole frame and manner, and a power of ruling men on high occasions which no one could escape noticing.<sup>10</sup>

The contrast with the neat, timid, goateed figure of General Wilson could not have been more striking, and a clash between the two was inevitable, especially given Nicholson's habitual inability to accept orders from anyone. Wilson resented Nicholson's patronising attitude: he was, after all, Nicholson's commanding officer; while Nicholson was appalled by Wilson's extreme caution and constant worrying. 'Wilson says he will assume the offensive on the arrival of the heavy guns,' Nicholson wrote to John Lawrence, 'but he says it in an undecided sort of way which makes me doubt if he will do so if he is not kept up to the mark … He is not at all equal to the crisis, and I believe he feels it himself.'

Later letters revealed the spat deepening: 'Wilson's head is going,' Nicholson told Lawrence in mid-August. 'He says so himself, and it is quite evident he speaks the truth.' Ruder still was a letter to Lawrence three weeks later: I have seen lots of useless generals in my day,' wrote Nicholson, 'but such an ignorant, croaking obstructive as he is I have never hitherto met with, and nothing will induce me to serve a day under his personal command after the fall of this place.'<sup>11</sup>

Yet even as Nicholson continued to complain, the logic of Wilson's approach – of building up the Ridge's defences and waiting until the siege train arrived – was being vindicated. For the rebel attacks had not ceased, and though they had become more infrequent, every time a new regiment of mutinous sepoys marched in over the Bridge of Boats, the troops were made to prove themselves by attacking the Ridge before they were accepted as part of the rebel army. The growing British success in dealing with such mass assaults at virtually no cost to themselves was largely due to Wilson's defensive precautions.

Several days earlier, after the Nimach sepoy regiment arrived from Rajasthan with 'several thousand men, ten field guns and three mortars', they had made a concerted attack on the Ridge. Supported by the Gwalior brigade and twelve field guns, their attack continued throughout the night, and right through until noon the following day. By lunchtime, over a thousand sepoys lay dead, but British casualties were minimal, and amounted to only forty-six wounded and killed. It was, thought Henry Daly of the Guides,\* 'the most successful and scientific drubbing we have shown Pandy. His loss has been great; his ammunition has been expended by cartloads; and he has never seen our men. These are the lessons we should teach when acting on the defensive'.<sup>12</sup>

Safe within their entrenchments, the British were more aware than ever of the sheer, blind, tragic bravery of their adversaries. 'Nothing could exceed their persistent courage in fighting almost every day,' wrote Charles Griffiths, 'and though beaten on every occasion, returning over and over again to renew their combat.'<sup>13</sup>

![](_page_4_Picture_4.jpeg)

The attacks from the city were not just growing more ineffective, they were also becoming more and more infrequent: as Hervey Greathed wrote to his wife on 4 August, 'scarcely a shot has been fired since the 2nd, even from the batteries, and it will be simple impertinence if they try another attack'.<sup>14</sup>

As the fighting grew quieter, and the confidence of the British greater, more diversions were found to occupy those with time on their hands. Some went fishing in the Yamuna canal at the back of the Ridge. Others played football, cricket and quoits, and one day there was a pony race. Greathed started going for daily rides beyond the encampment, and noted he 'could [now] ride with safety for long distances', while admitting to his wife that the stink from the 'effluvia of dead animals beyond the precincts of the camp takes away from the pleasure of such excursions'.<sup>15</sup>

There was also more food and more luxuries around: a vast flock of sheep had been driven down from Ferozepur, providing welcome supplies of fresh mutton, while the Anglophile rajas of the Punjab had begun sending down regular supplies of grain. A day's march to the north of Delhi, the Raja of Jheend guarded an efficiently managed British supply base at Rhai.<sup>16</sup> For those who could afford it, Peake & Allen of Ambala had opened a shop selling such rare exotica as tooth powder, pins, paper, chocolates and 'some good Moselle', though their brandy, at 8 rupees a bottle, was out of the reach of most pockets. More affordable was the beer offered by the Parsi merchants Jehangeer and Cowasjee, who undercut Peake & Allen to offer their 'best English bottled' for 15 rupees a dozen.<sup>17</sup>

There were still many deaths daily from cholera, and the stink of decaying bodies and animals on the Ridge was worse than ever; but there was widespread awareness in the trenches that the tide had begun to turn, and spirits were much higher than a month previously. 'I must say', wrote Hervey Greathed on 6 August,

that there is less croaking and more cheeriness here than perhaps in any other spot in India … The mutineers have been defeated in 25 combats since we encamped on our present ground and they have now received all the reinforcements on which they can reckon, and are exhausting their supply of munitions. On the other hand our force will shortly be reinforced … and it is not likely the fall of the city can be delayed beyond the end of the month. The delusion that

our Raj is at an end is losing its hold even on the minds of the most ignorant and turbulent. I do not anticipate much difficulty in restoring our authority. 18

Others kept up their spirits by dreaming of the riches of Delhi spread out below them, hoping to pick up 'a nice little diamond or two' from the 'rich old niggers'.<sup>19</sup> 'Delhi was in 1857 one of the largest, most beautiful and certainly the richest city in Hindostan,' wrote Charles Griffiths. 'We knew well there was wealth untold within its walls, and our hearts were cheered even at this time when we thought of the prize money which would fall to our share at the capture of the rebellious city.'<sup>20</sup>

The force of the monsoon was now ebbing, and the steaming bogs of July had given way by August to lush and glossy greenery. Some of the more aestetically sensitive British officers came to realise what they had not before noticed: the astonishing beauty of their position. One who did so was the articulate and intelligent Harry Gambier. Only twenty-three years old, and not long out of Eton, he had been in Delhi on 11 May, and had fled that night with Colonel Knyvett. Several days later he and Knyvett had joined up with Vibart's party, where Gambier fell head over heels in love – as so many had done before – with the lovely Annie Forrest, whom he had long admired from a distance.

Harry and Annie had become close through the shared ordeal of being robbed by Gujars and wandering hungry and half naked through the villages of the Doab, before their party was finally rescued by Farasu. From the Ridge, Gambier now wrote cheery and poetic letters to Annie at Meerut. He described his daily life on the Ridge, ranging from the melon-and-mango fool he had every day for breakfast, through to the military manoeuvres that he witnessed. He and Annie had both spent some time together at Delhi parties before the outbreak; now he wrote to tell her how very different the place looked under siege. 'The scene is very beautiful,' he wrote.

Imagine yourself at the Flagstaff Tower at sunset. Behind is a glowing bank of clouds, a green undulating horizon, a white broad streak of tumble down lines, fallen pillars and blackened bungalows. Now look towards the city. The ridge is on the right and left, at your feet a level plain, exquisitely green and in places

thickly planted, stretches to the City walls. The racquet court looks clean, and officers play occasionally; beyond it is the next house where Mr Curl lived – opposite them the Assembly Rooms, roofless and charred, [which provoke] very different reminiscences: of lights, music, skirts, 'bodies' and hanging head dresses, pumps, Le Bas, Lancers, and last Polkas and, as you will say it if I do not, I may as well add Miss H., with her nice angles and sulky face …

Beyond the Assembly Rooms one can see Ludlow Castle [formerly the house of the Resident, Simon Fraser], behind it the two pukka houses in one of which latterly the Galloways lived … Through a telescope Pandies can be seen swarming about, sneaking up under the cover of walls and stones for a shot at our pickets, though they always miss! The city stretches out to make one's mouth water if one were an artist. The river sweeps down in a broad silver sheet spanned by a delicate line which is the still intact bridge of boats; a flash, a column of smoke, and bang comes a shot from the Water Bastion into Metcalfe's stables … The dome of the church is minus the cross, the Jama Masjid looks provokingly erect and towering in majesty beside it – as if Christianity lay low before the false Prophet's faith. The [guns in the] ruins of the Cashmere gate send their shot crashing into the old mosque [up on the Ridge] and the shells burst all about it. Hindu Rao's [House] receives the same little attentions from the Mori, Cabul and Lahore Gates, while the [guns on] Ajmere Gate play down Subjee Mundi.<sup>21</sup>

While Gambier was sensitive enough to notice and describe the beauty of the scene, he was aware that the brutality of the fighting was hardening and coarsening him, and was candid enough to write this to Annie. He described how in one engagement a force of sepoy cavalry had been beaten back, and

a horse wandered riderless after they had retired. Two men went down the road under cover of walls & captured the horse and near him found a sawar slightly wounded, so they kicked him in the head and he died. My heart is hardened and it does not excite the pity that a similar act would in the case of a nobler enemy. It was a beautiful white arab, but a shot through the body had done its work. Doubtless it was once an officer's charger. The deathsweat dimmed

his glossy coat, and the strained eye and inflated nostril and trembling limbs betrayed his agony. A bullet ended his pain, and I gave the horse the regret that I could not feel for the man.<sup>22</sup>

Even more changed was Edward Vibart. Harry Gambier had learned that his sister had moved from Kanpur to Lucknow just before the outbreak, and that she had therefore escaped the massacre there; Vibart was less lucky. After a period of recuperation from the ordeal of his escape from Delhi, he had discovered just before he left Meerut that both his parents, his younger brothers and two of his sisters had all been killed in the Kanpur massacre; and he suspected – wrongly as it turned out – that his sisters had been raped before being murdered.

Vibart had kept his good humour and his humanity throughout the trauma of 11 May and his subsequent flight to Meerut. But now he had lost everything he had lived for, and yearned only for revenge, to kill or be killed. Indeed, he soon convinced himself that God had spared him for this specific purpose: 'To avenge my parents – my darling mother, my little brothers and sisters – my poor father.'<sup>23</sup>

I feel now that nothing could ever give me any pleasure or happiness again,' he wrote to his Uncle Gordon one of his few surviving relatives, in England.

All I think of are my poor slaughtered parents – and I go about mechanically as it were, little caring what becomes of me. Oh God! Why was I spared so mercifully, and then my parents taken from me? With an aching heart I take up each paper as it comes in and read it through – each harrowing detail of their misery at Cawnpore. Sometimes I fancy that God would never have thus afflicted them, and I think them still alive, and my beloved mother's face comes before me and I see it as she wrote me that letter as she heard of my escape, 'To my dying hour,' she wrote, 'I will bless the Almighty & remember my feelings of gratitude to him, that you my boy, my own beloved boy, have been so mercifully spared to us,' – and now I have lost that loving mother. All I have to remind me of her is that one precious letter.

My own father too – I see him as I wished him goodbye to return to Delhi, only four days before the fearful outbreak. As he held my hand, he said 'God bless you my boy,' – and now I am alive, and he is gone … When I think of what he may have had to suffer, with no one near him to comfort him or give him consolation, Oh I'm driven wild and I vow vengeance on these wretches, murderers and fiends …

I came over here [to the Ridge] – not caring for death, but only for revenge – to be able to say, if I lived, 'Yes, I was there too, I too was at Delhi and helped to revenge my parents.' Sometimes I do feel a shudder at seeing these black creatures killed, yet it is only momentary: I have seen five sepoys lying dead, and I have gone and spat on them. I saw two shot yesterday, and when they were dead they were thrown into the river – may each murderer die thus … Slay on and spare not ye soldiers! Remember Cawnpore!<sup>24</sup>

News of the astonishing violence and viciousness of the British response to the Uprising elsewhere was now filtering through to Delhi. Recently there had arrived within Delhi a detachment of *sawars* fleeing the carnage of the British 'Army of Retribution' at Kanpur, who told stories of the mass murder committed by General Neill's troops after they had retaken the site of the massacre: of how every village in the path of the army was torched, and old men, women and children burned to death in their houses; of how the Sikhs were allowed to torture, impale and burn alive the captured sepoys; how others were being made to lick clean the floor of the massacre site, and then, having been ritually outcaste by having 'pork, beef and everything which could possibly break caste' stuffed down their throats, they were sewn into pigskins and hanged. But even that was not the end: Neill ordered that, contrary to the dictates of both faiths, all Hindus were then to 'be buried, and the Mohammedans burned'.<sup>25</sup>

Everywhere the British convinced themselves that the atrocities committed by the sepoys against their women and children absolved them of any need to treat the rebels as human beings: 'Since they had butchered our defenceless women and children,' wrote Colonel A. R. D. Mackenzie, 'we would have been more than human, we would have been less than men, if we had not exterminated them as men kill snakes wherever they meet

them.'<sup>26</sup> It soon became exceptional among the British to regard anyone on the opposite side of the battle lines as even belonging to the same species: 'I [simply] cannot consider these sepoys human beings,' wrote Captain J. M. Wade, 'and it is only common practice to destroy them as reptiles.'<sup>27</sup> George Wagentrieber helped fan such flames from his new *Delhi Gazette Extra* printing press in Lahore: 'our army is exasperated almost to madness by what they have seen of the brutality of the insurgents', he expostulated in one editorial.<sup>28</sup>

Moreover, as far as many of the British troops were concerned, their fury and thirst for revenge were not so much a desire as a right enshrined in the Bible. One British soldier, 'Quaker' Wallace, was in the habit of bayoneting his sepoy adversaries while chanting the 116th Psalm. As General Neill put it, 'The Word of God gives no authority to the modern tenderness for human life.'<sup>29</sup> Padre Rotton was in full agreement. The rebels did not realise, he wrote, that the Uprising was in fact

a battle of principles, a conflict between truth and error; and that because they had elected in favour of darkness, and eschewed the light, therefore they could not possibly succeed. Moreover, they had imbrued their hands in the innocent blood of helpless women and children, and that very blood was [now] appealing to heaven for vengeance. The appeal was unquestionably heard. The Lord could not do otherwise than be avenged on such a nation as this.<sup>30</sup>

Hervey Greathed was not sorry to hear of the fear spreading through Delhi at reports of the brutal British vengeance: 'The sawars who have reached the city from Cawnpore give dismal accounts of their defeat,' he wrote to his wife. 'They estimate the slaughter at 10,000 and tell terrific tales of the [kilt-wearing Scottish] Highlanders; they say they are men in petticoats, who come from Ceylon, and are Cannibals, to whom the Gurkhas are mere mice.'

He added, however, that the people and sepoys within Delhi now had many other more pressing worries, and the British now thought that rebels might flee the city altogether, so untenable had their position become in the face not of a military but rather a logistical catastrophe. 'They are badly off for money, ammunition and food,' he wrote. I am beginning to get letters

from the princes, declaring that they have been all along fondly attached to us, and that they only want to know what they can do for us. They must find out for themselves, for I shall not answer and tell them.'<sup>31</sup>

![](_page_11_Picture_1.jpeg)

As the soldiers on the Ridge found themselves with more to eat and less to worry about, their counterparts in Delhi were now every day growing closer to starvation.

The military and strategic limitation of the sepoys had been apparent for some time now, especially their failure to gather intelligence, to co-ordinate effectively with other rebel centres such as Kanpur and Lucknow, or to persuade most of the independent rajas of central India and Rajputana to come off the fence and join with the cause. In particular, the Delhi rebels failed to recognise how very easily they could have taken the British from the rear on the Ridge: 'I think Wilson has hitherto had considerable cause for anxiety,' wrote Nicholson on 28 August. 'Had the enemy had the enterprise to detach a strong force to his rear, we could not have sent more than five or six hundred men against it. But it is too late for them to try that game now, and they know it, and are at their wits' end to devise some new plan of action.'<sup>32</sup>

It was, however, only as the siege wore on that it became apparent that it would be the failures of the rebels' administrative and financial organisation, every bit as much as their military and strategic shortcomings, which would lead to their ultimate undoing. They had created turbulence and chaos, but could not restore order. This was particularly fatal for them in the countryside around Delhi. Their failure to establish a well-governed 'liberated area' or Mughal realm from which they could draw tax revenue, manpower and, most of all, food supplies, ultimately proved the Delhi rebels' single most disastrous failure. This was something Maulvi Muhammad Baqar recognised at the time and wrote about repeatedly in his editorials: 'What strange indifference,' he wrote, 'that we have not attempted to collect one single rupee of tax revenue.'

God knows what design or purpose there is in this failure, and what is causing such slackness … Some or other Amir or nobleman should be deputed to collect tribute and revenue from the Rajahs and other notables, so that the administration and control of his exalted Majesty is established. At all places and districts where the Collectors of the *Kafirs* used to be posted, there a representative of his Exalted Majesty, as Ziladar, should be placed, along with some troops and the Islamic standard. The villages are already identified and marked, and money can be collected from there as prescribed. Everywhere a platoon or platoons should be posted. There is no doubt that without measures like this the notables and local potentates around these regions would not be able to give up the awe of the *Kafirs* which they still harbour in their hearts, and they will not give up of their deepest hope of seeing their own [Mughal] government restored.<sup>33</sup>

The accuracy of this observation became clearer and clearer as June gave way to July and August, and the city grew hungrier, and thirstier. The British had cut off the flow of the Yamuna canal into the city early in June, so that the only water now came from the brackish wells within the city and the river to the east, where water carriers and bathers found themselves exposed to British shellfire.<sup>34</sup> Despite this, many still came to take water, and even to sit and fish, exposed in the open, risking a stray shell in the hope of hooking a fresh catch.<sup>35</sup> The food situation was equally dire. Ever since June, petitions from starving citizens, jihadis and sepoys begging for food and sustenance had been piling into the Red Fort, and the intense hunger on the streets of the city had become a prominent theme of the spies' reports.

As early as 7 June, even the employees of the royal household were complaining that they had received no rations for a month.<sup>36</sup> On 12 June the deputy kotwal wrote to his assistants begging them to find some food for the new battalions from Haryana who had just marched into Delhi. At the bottom is the reply: 'It is submitted that there is nothing left in the shops, no flour, no pulses, nothing. What should we do?'<sup>37</sup> By 15 June, the officers of the different regiments were coming to the Fort and complaining that their

troops could not attack the British on empty stomachs, and that their sepoys had begun returning, 'driven back by hunger before the battle is over'.<sup>38</sup>

Six weeks later, on 28 July, Kishan Dayal and Qadir Bakhsh, subahdars of the Meerut sepoys, came to court to say their men were now starving. They had left behind in Meerut all their possessions when they mutinied, 'so are now very hard pressed. Some eight-ten days have passed and we have not even received a single chick-pea. My men are dismayed at the expense of everything, and there are no money-lenders who will give them loans'.<sup>39</sup>

It was not just the moneylenders: the traders and shopkeepers too refused to provide credit; on 4 August, the Delhi confectioners went en masse to the kotwal, and announced that since they had not been paid for past supplies, they would no longer provide sweets without payment in cash.<sup>40</sup> By 14 August, the newly arrived Nimach brigade were openly threatening to desert if they were not fed. The brigade's two subahdars came before Zafar to tell him of the full desperation of their situation:

My Lord, this submission is about the Nimach force that arrived in the capital after traversing a great distance and overcoming many obstacles, with the expectation of serving your Imperial Majesty. Until now your obedient servants have themselves been paying the expenses of the horses, cavalry, artillery, cattle, elephants and camels. My Lord the cavalry and the artillery and the elephants and the camels belong to the Sarkar [British government] and until now whatever the circumstances, their allowances were always paid. But now, for four or five days, the entire force including the soldiers and the animals have been starving and there is no money left to pay even their basic expenses. All the soldiers are determined to fight, but they ask us: how can a man who has been fasting for two three days do battle?

Therefore we hope that out of your largesse and largeness of heart can you please provide for all the expenses incurred by the Royal force and honour these humble ones with a reply. Otherwise kindly inform the soldiers, for until arrangements are made for payment, no soldier is ready to do battle. Please do not construe this as disobedience, but should you not want the Nimach brigade to remain, then kindly give us a clear answer. Whatever is ordained

will happen. Innumerable petitions have been sent earlier but we have yet not received any response.

With the greatest respect, and devotedly,

General Sudhari Singh and Brigade Major Hira Singh<sup>41</sup>

In the event, the Nimach brigade were persuaded to stay, even though no money or food was immediately available; but spies reported a growing haemorrhage of deserters from the rebel army: according to the spy Turab Ali, in the first week of August alone 750 cavalrymen and 600 jihadis went 'to their native place … because they could not obtain their daily bread in the city'.<sup>42</sup>

Throughout July and August the Court of Administration, led by Mirza Mughal, made frantic efforts to raise the money to pay for food and cover the expenses of the soldiers. At first they tried borrowing from the city's moneylenders, but succeeded in raising only 6,000 rupees, enough for just a few days' supplies. The *thanadar* of Chandni Chowk, who was given the job of extracting the money from the bankers and *baniyas* of Katra Nil, reported 'that some of these people disappear into their houses; others do not give any response, while most make one excuse or another to keep this servant at bay, and are forever on the lookout for ways of evading their dues'.<sup>43</sup> A month later it was the same story: 'whenever this servant goes to their houses,' reported the *thanadar*, 'they shut their doors and do not give any reply. They vanish away'. A note at the bottom in Mirza Mughal's hand, and stamped with his seal, suggested a more vigorous approach: 'Proclaim an order', suggested the Prince, 'that if these money-lenders remain hidden you will blow them from a cannon.'<sup>44</sup>

A message was sent to Laxmi Chand, the famously wealthy moneylender in Mathura, on the road to Agra, but although he was offered the position of *Fotadar* (Treasurer) in return for a loan of 5 lakh rupees, he said he was unable to help.\* <sup>45</sup> In retaliation, the moneylender's Delhi agent was arrested and taken to the Bareilly troop's camp, where he was 'illtreated'.<sup>46</sup>

On 7 August, in desperation, Mirza Mughal arrested all the city's leading *baniyas* and bankers and brought them to the Fort, where they were threatened with death if they did not produce their fortunes and offer them for the Uprising. Among those arrested were various former English

officials, including Munshi Jiwan Lal, who was surprised by sepoys when he opened his haveli gates one evening to let in the water carriers. He was bound and taken to the Red Fort, where he was horrified by what he saw:

I was taken upstairs before Mirza Mughal. There I saw that a great crowd of people was assembled, but in a strange irregular fashion. On one side sat Mirza Mughal reclining on his pillows … while in front of the Mirza was the famous Kuray Singh, the Tilanga Brigade Major, stretched at full length on his bed. There was not a semblance of court etiquette, and the King's officials were moving here and there without order. Lala Saligram, Ramji Das Gurwala and about 25 bankers were sitting there under arrest; I was also ordered to sit in the same row with them.

Money was demanded from us and we were threatened so far that guns were placed over our shoulders and fired. But in spite of this our hearts remained firm, and we made up our minds rather to die than to yield to the threats of the rebels, and so we were kept in this sad condition [all night] until 4pm [the following day].<sup>47</sup>

Throughout the day and night, pistols were produced and the members of the group were threatened with death. In the end, however, Munshi Jiwan Lal and the other munshis were saved by the Anglophile Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh, who took Mirza Mughal aside and warned him, 'The English will capture Delhi and you will fall into their hands. These men are the Munshis of the English and you will have recourse to their assistance. I advise you to set them free, and thus keep them under an obligation.'<sup>48</sup>

When threatening the bankers had failed, Mirza Mughal tried to persuade the traders in the bazaar to supply 5 lakh rupees, and also to provide food to the army on credit with the promise that 'money would be paid when the salaries were distributed'. But the traders refused to accept the court's word, even when pressured by the kotwal and threatened with imprisonment and the systematic looting of their shops.<sup>49</sup> By early August spies were reporting that many of the Punjabi merchants as well as 'Marwarees of Ashrafee ka Katra' had been thrown into jail until they paid up.50° Many other moneylenders joined them there, including one of the most prominent of all, Saligram.<sup>51</sup> They remained in confinement until the

first week of September when Zafar learned what had happened, whereupon 'Mirza Mughal was ordered not to allow such ill treatment of the King's subjects, and that it was better to take what each agreed and to realise it by gentle means'.<sup>52</sup>

There were also various attempts to raise 300,000 rupees from the nobles of the city, and half-hearted efforts to tax the small area to the west of Delhi – the villages of Mehrauli and Gurgaon – that were still nominally under Zafar's control; but again little money was forthcoming.<sup>53</sup> By the end of the month, Mirza Mughal's men were so desperate for money that they had begun digging for buried treasure in the Mughal Bastille of Salimgarh, opposite the Red Fort. 'People say to the Emperor that the treasures of his forebears are buried here,' recorded the spy Gauri Shankar. 'Some even mention exact spots – but nothing has emerged yet.'<sup>54</sup> Later, they dug up 'some small field pieces', but the promised treasure proved more elusive.<sup>55</sup>

A similar degree of desperation fuelled the spurious rumours that the Persian Army was coming to save the rebels, that it had fought its way through Afghanistan and into India via Peshawar, and was now crossing the Indus at Attock. Another seaborne assault of Iranian troops was said to be on its way via Bombay. 'We cannot verify the news,' remarked Baqar in the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar*, 'but it is not an impossibility.'<sup>56</sup>

For it was not just money which was running out by the middle of August: supplies of gunpowder and gun caps were also running low. This was the single most startling example of negligence on the part of the rebel administration, for at the outbreak they had inherited the largest arsenal of weapons and ammunition in northern India. For the first ten days of the Uprising, however, no guard had been placed over the munitions that had survived the explosion at the magazine, so that the townspeople, and even the Gujars from the countryside, had come and helped themselves.<sup>57</sup>

The result was that by late July fuses for shells and percussion caps were both in short supply; gunpowder had run out, and attempts to manufacture it ran into trouble from the lack of saltpetre and sulphur in the city. Various attempts were made to send out to famous firework manufacturers across Hindustan for assistance; one of these, 'Akbar Khan, a resident of Meerut went to the Princes and offered to make a projectile of such size and power that it would destroy a whole section of men. Convinced of his ability to do so, they advanced him the sum of Rs 4000 for expenses and ordered him to

commence the work at once in the Palace'; but the experiment does not seem to have been a success.<sup>58</sup>

There was even an attempt to use the alcoholic spirits seized from English houses to manufacture explosive, and on 2 September '144 bottles of wine' were sent to the gunpowder factory, but the results were mixed at best. English observers noted that while the marksmanship of the rebel artillery remained very good throughout the siege, from July onwards it became increasingly common for the rebel shells to fail to explode.<sup>59</sup>

The most serious blow came on 7 August, when a stray British shell ignited one of the principal rebel gunpowder factories, located in Gali Churiwallan, incinerating the 500 people working there. The sepoys assumed there had been treachery at work, and attacked the haveli of Zafar's prime minister, Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, whom they accused of treason. The haveli was burned to the ground, saddening Ghalib: he was a close friend of the hakim, and had spent many convivial evenings in the house. In *Dastanbuy*, he saw it as yet another assault on the civilised and highly cultured Delhi he loved and had helped to create. Although the hakim's life was saved, wrote Ghalib, 'the mischief was not finished until the house was completely devastated'.

That mansion, which in beauty and ornament, was equal to the painted palaces of China, was looted and the roofs were burned. The great beams and the inlaid panels of the ceiling were reduced to ashes. The walls were so completely blackened by smoke it seemed that, in grief, the mansion wore a black mantle.

Do not be misled by the fortunes the skies may bestow. The treacherous skies entangle, In anguish and torment, Those they formerly laid in the lap of love.<sup>60</sup>

By mid-August, as the food shortages were beginning to bite, large numbers of hungry sepoys and jihadis had begun to drift away every day from the city, despairing of continuing the fight if there was nothing to eat.

According to one intelligence letter received by Hodson on 16 August, Zafar was too depressed, detached and possibly now too unhinged even to

attempt to prevent them going; in his own eyes at least he had now removed himself from participation in the Uprising: 'Yesterday some two hundred Tilangas, fully armed, dressed and mounted, were on their way [out of the city] when some rebel forces stopped them, and reported it to the fort,' wrote an anonymous spy.

The King called them to the court and asked them why they were going. They said, 'our wives and families would be worried about us; moreover there is nothing left to eat, that is the real reason why we are going.' So the King asked them to submit whatever arms and cavalry accoutrements they had, and then allowed them to go. He then openly declared in court, 'I do not care who goes or stays. I did not ask anybody to come here and I do not stop anyone [from leaving]. Whoever wants to stay can do so, otherwise they can go away. I have no objections. I have detained these arms so that if the English come here, I can hand it over to them. If the troops want them they can take it. I have no stake in the matter. 61

No wonder that Maulvi Muhammad Baqar, Zafar's most loyal supporter, should write at this time that 'His Majesty's state of mind remains unwell'.<sup>62</sup> By the end of the month, the hunger had got worse still. On the 30th more disappointed, starving and emaciated troops came to the Palace to declare that they could not go on unless they were fed.

My Lord, from the day we arrived here we devoted ones have prostrated ourselves at your feet. But you have not provided any upkeep for us, and whatever we brought has been expended. If you cannot provide for us then you must tell us. There is so much starvation that we have no option but to break from your Majesty and go somewhere else. Except for your Majesty, everybody else in the city of Delhi, including the civil servants, are in alliance with the English.<sup>63</sup>

In the city, meanwhile, the people sat behind locked doors, trying to survive as best they could. As August progressed, the impression that emerges from the petitions in the Mutiny Papers is of a wrecked, semi-derelict and starving city. Gamblers and what the petitioners refer to as 'rogues, rascals

and bad characters' sat playing cards in the burned-out houses that had been looted by the sepoys or received direct hits from British shells; one petition from Mir Akbar Ali of the Faiz Bazaar complains that the gamblers used to sit on the top of the ruins so that they could peer into his zenana courtyard, 'ogle the women within and shout reprehensible abuses'.<sup>64</sup> Most shops were shuttered and empty, unless they had been taken over as billets for the soldiery, in which case dispirited sepoys could be seen sitting on the steps, smoking 'bhang and churrus [marijuana preparations]'.<sup>65</sup>

Law and order remained as precarious as ever. Groups of hungry sepoys were still demanding protection money, most recently from the shop owners of Chandni Chowk.<sup>66</sup> Others raided neighbouring houses just to stave off starvation. The Gwalior Cavalry, who had been billeted in the Delhi haveli of Franz Gottlieb Cohen – the poet Farasu – and had up to the middle of August behaved with unusual restraint, eventually went on the rampage in the adjacent *muhalla*, stopping in at the local police station on the way back to explain, 'we do not get to eat, therefore we plunder the muhalla'.<sup>67</sup> Outside the walls the situation was even worse: as early as June, Delhi's grass-cutters were refusing to go beyond the city walls unless accompanied by a military escort.<sup>68</sup>

For the poor, the moneylenders were as much an anxiety as either the sepoys in the city or the British on the Ridge. Though the *baniyas* claimed poverty to the city officials, and refused to give or lend money to help the Uprising, they stepped up their attempts to call in outstanding debts, and there are mountains of petitions surviving in the Mutiny Papers from poverty-stricken Delhiwallahs driven to distraction by their extortions. On 16 August, for example, a delegation from the area around Delhi Darwaza came to the King complaining about Lala Jatmal and his associates, who had come with horsemen and foot soldiers,

threatening and extorting money even from helpless women and widows, and from the indigent … My lord, Lala Jatmal has used great force and coercion. He has collected money from each and every house … we poor ones are deprived of two square meals. He should be given a stringent punishment because he adopted illegal and crooked ways. If you do this, in future others will fear to oppress or cheat anyone.<sup>69</sup>

With no effective police force, it was also easy to settle old scores: a petition received from the residents of Muhalla Maliwara complained that Radha and Kanhaiya, two powerful women whom they had previously prosecuted, were openly planning to take revenge: 'Now these people threaten us and say, "what harm you have caused us by filing a suit. We will now attack you because there is no government." We are all afraid for our lives. Please ask the Kotwal to investigate this matter.'<sup>70</sup>

The breakdown of normal life did at least provide an opportunity for lovers to run off together, and judging by the number of petitions flowing in during that month, the growing anarchy of August seems to have facilitated a bacchanal of elopement. Balahiyya, wife of Suraj Bali, ran off with Bhikari, 'having looted me of all my wealth which she took away by stealth', according to her surprised and hurt husband.<sup>71</sup> A former courtesan named Hussaini, who had married one Sheikh Islam, also took the opportunity to head off with a new man. The sheikh explained to Zafar that he was a convert from Hinduism who had fled from Meerut at the outbreak and come to seek shelter in Delhi. Not long after their arrival near the 'Id Gah, Hussaini had met Khuda Bakhsh the Shoemaker, whom the sheikh described as 'a spy and a gambler'. Perhaps missing the liveliness of her old life, and finding the company of the sheikh a little staid, Hussaini left Sheikh Islam, taking with her, said the sheikh, 'all the valuables I had brought from home'.<sup>72</sup>

Some of the lovers were sepoys for, as in many wars, dashing soldiers are rarely short of admirers. Certainly Pir Bakhsh the tinbeater and maker of pots and pans, who had been cohabiting not only with his own wife but also with his brother's widow Ziya, and according to the neighbours regularly beating her up, lost her in late August to a sepoy named Zamir. The sepoy apparently gave her shelter after a bad domestic fight: 'all the residents of Katra Muhalla can bear witness to Pir Bakhsh's beatings', Ziya told the court when they took evidence on the case. Pir Bakhsh denied the charge, claiming it was his wife who had beaten Ziya: 'All I did was slap her once,' he said in a statement. 'It was a fight between women.' He also said that he did not intend to marry Ziya, and it appears that Zamir was allowed to take Ziya away with him; certainly Pir Bakhsh had to sign an undertaking saying he would 'not commit any oppression on that woman and if I cause any harm I will pay a fifty rupees fine'.<sup>73</sup>

Others took the opportunity to satisfy their desires by abducting and raping women. The courtesans were particularly vulnerable, as they had been throughout the Uprising. The courtesan Manglo, who had been kidnapped early in May by the *sawar* Rustam Khan, was still in captivity in late July, despite his receiving two orders from the Palace to release her.

Repeated petitions about her were received at the Palace both from her brother Chandan, who seems to have worked as her pimp, and a man who described himself as 'Chhedi, a traveller from Camp Gurgaon' and who said he had been 'made homeless by the depredations of the godless Firangis' – in other words he was one of the many refugees from the countryside fleeing homeless from the acts of retribution wreaked on villages deemed to have been hostile, or to have failed to help the British as they fled Delhi on the night of 11 May. According to Chhedi, 'one gruesome incident has already taken place in this regiment when Farzand Ali, the court Dafadar [sepoy rank equivalent to a guard and petty officer], murdered a courtesan named Imamam by choking her to death. This slave fears that Rustam Khan will kill the said woman, as he threatens and beats her up all day and all night long'.<sup>74</sup> When yet another order to release Manglo was torn up by Rustam's risaldar (cavalry commander), a *sawar* named Faiz Khan, Chandan wrote again to the court, repeating that Rustam Khan

has imprisoned her and beats her up and even though that courtesan shouts and screams nobody helps her. In spite of repeated summons the said Risaldar has not yet obeyed the orders. Should this state of anarchy and injustice continue the subjects of the Exalted One will be destroyed. Therefore I hope that another *parwana* [written order or edict] will be issued to the said Risaldar regarding the recovery of the courtesan … Her statement should be registered in the office so that this poor one is compensated, and he can sing prayers for the welfare and fame of the Exalted One.<sup>75</sup>

It was not just the sepoys who were on the loose in the streets of the besieged city: the more delinquent princes were also at large, pursuing their pleasures as they wished. The worst offender, as ever, was Mirza Abu Bakr. One not untypical night saw him turn up at the haveli of Mirza Ghulam

Ghaus, whose sisters were celebrated Delhi beauties. Mirza Abu Bakr allegedly told Ghulam Ghaus,

'I am very drunk,' and he began to say foul words. When I told my sisters to hide themselves then he (Abu Bakr) raised his sword over me, and pointed his pistol, but I succeeded in pacifying him … In the meantime the gates of the Muhalla had been locked to prevent any untoward incident, and as there was some delay in getting the keys, he began abusing the residents and then he fired countless volleys from double barrelled guns at the gate … A Grenadier from the Faiz Bazaar came up and said something, but Mirza Abu Bakr struck him thrice with a sword. By then forty soldiers from the Alexander Platoon and other Tilangas gathered and began to establish order in the Muhalla. While this was happening, I got my sisters to jump over the wall, and had them sent around to Lal Kuan for their own safety. 76

It was just as well he did so. For before long, Mirza Abu Bakr and his companions broke into the house and looted it, even driving away with them 'a horse and a pair of oxen' they found in the inner courtyard. As they were leaving, the Prince was challenged by the deputy kotwal, who had now ridden up to investigate the disturbance, but Mirza Abu Bakr ignored his protestations and instead lunged at him with a sword, and in the mêlée managed to seize his horse too. At this point, however, Mirza Abdulla, son of Zafar's eldest boy, the late Mirza Shah Rukh, rode up and rebuked his cousin for causing such a disturbance, and managed to persuade him to leave the place and return to the Red Fort.<sup>77</sup>

It was hardly surprising in light of this increasingly chaotic urban breakdown that Maulvi Muhammad Baqar's *Dihli Urdu Akbhar* made for sombre reading. 'Death hovers overhead on all sides,' wrote Baqar in his editorial of 23 August. 'What is happening all around us should be seen as a result of our [bad] deeds and actions. We have taken our base selves as our God, and do not consider the words and commands of the Almighty.'

Baqar also dwelt at some length on the acts of revenge being taken by the British in Kanpur and elsewhere: 'now the *Kafir* Christians have begun to commit grave depredations, especially upon Muslims. Wherever they gain control they indiscriminately hang men, destroy entire villages, and

where they cannot cause any harm to the victorious army, they take out their anger on our Emperor's subjects'<sup>78</sup>

![](_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg)

The most serious threat to any remaining hope of victory over the British continued, however, to be the disagreements between the different regiments; and these were now steadily growing worse than ever.

The leaders of the brigade from Nimach, the last large-scale addition to the rebel ranks, took against Bakht Khan's authority even more strongly than the subahdars of the Meerut and Delhi regiments, and on 23 August went as far as to accuse him – quite unjustly – of collusion with the British, 'withholding his soldiers until the British should receive reinforcements from England'.<sup>79</sup>

In all this, they were goaded on by the British spy and agent provocateur Gauri Shankar Sukul of the Haryana Regiment, who produced a Sikh witness who gave false evidence that he had seen Bakht Khan send notes to the Ridge. Bakht Khan swore his loyalty, but Zafar openly discussed the possibility of banning him from the Fort, while the officers of the Nimach brigade began hatching a plot to disarm the Bareilly troops by force.<sup>80</sup>

It was with a view to re-establishing his authority, and making one last concerted bid to oust the British, that Bakht Khan came up with an ingenious and ambitious new plan: his idea was to send out a large force by the Ajmeri Gate, which would set off as if retreating westwards. But rather than heading on towards Jaipur, the force would cross the Yamuna canal by the bridge near Najafgarh, and then double back to ambush the British from behind. It was exactly the sort of imaginative plan the rebels should have come up with two months earlier when the British were at their most vulnerable. By this stage Zafar was happy to agree to any plan that would remove the sepoys from his city. 'Go, may God protect you!' he said. 'Show your loyalty by attacking the English; destroy them and return victorious.'<sup>81</sup>

So it was that, in pouring rain on 24 August, Bakht Khan headed off out of the city with one of the largest forces yet gathered for a single attack: 9,000 men and thirteen guns. They struck out, over the wet roads, for the walled village of Najafgarh, hoping to cross the canal just to the south of the village.

When the sepoys reached the Yamuna canal, just to the north of Palam, it was raining harder than ever, and they found that the bridge had been destroyed on the orders of General Wilson, as part of his strategy of keeping the sepoys away from the British rear. Bakht Khan had come prepared for this, and had the bridge repaired, but the job was done badly, and the bridge broke again almost as soon as the troops began to cross it. It was twentyfour hours before the repairs were completed, and during the wait the entire force was 'exposed for a whole day and night to the inclemency of the season and thoroughly drenched with rain'. Moreover, 'the rebel troops had [now] been practically starving for three days'.<sup>82</sup>

On the 25th, wet, hungry and disconsolate, the rebel force moved off again, passing in narrow file along the banks of the Najafgarh swamp, which lay beyond. It was hard going, according to Sa'id Mubarak Shah: 'The troops were already greatly fatigued by the time they arrived at the swamp, or *jhil*, but had no time to rest and refresh themselves. The wheels of the gun carriages sank so continually in the swamp that the progress was very slow, and the sepoys had to wade through water which was above their knees.'<sup>83</sup>

When they set off from Delhi, Bakht Khan's Bareilly troops had been in the lead. But after the halt at the bridge, it was the Nimach brigade, led by Bakht Khan's rivals and enemies, General Sudhari Singh and Brigade Major Hira Singh, who led the column, followed by a small party from the Nasirabad regiment. Only two days before, the two Nimach generals had tried to topple Bakht Khan from his command. It was not a combination that boded well for the success of the expedition.

![](_page_24_Picture_4.jpeg)

The British watched the vast army of sepoys leave the city through their field glasses: 'They were seen from the Ridge for hours trooping out of the Lahore and Ajmir Gates,' wrote Charles Griffiths, 'and proceeding to our right rear.'<sup>84</sup> When the reports of Bakht Khan's departure reached General Wilson, he knew exactly whom to send to head him off: indeed, in many ways he was even more anxious to get John Nicholson out of the camp than Zafar was to lose Bakht Khan.

Nicholson set off with the Moveable Column in torrential rain at 4 a.m. the following morning, the 25th. In addition to his own men, he brought three troops of horse artillery and a mixed party of British infantry from the Field Force, including his own younger brother, Charles Nicholson, as well as Charles Griffiths and Edward Vibart. In all, Nicholson's small army amounted to 2,500 men, half of them British. In the lead, acting as guide to the back roads of Delhi, was Theo Metcalfe.

Wilson's one order had been to stick to the roads and not get lost in the monsoon bogs. Nicholson immediately ignored the advice and took a short cut that Theo recommended through flooded countryside, where the horse artillery had to be pulled out of kneedeep mud. Despite the mud and the downpour, Nicholson managed to galvanise the column to move along at his customary speed, believing as ever that surprise was all. The column quick-marched for six hours, stopped at 10 a.m. for a damp two-hour breakfast at the village of Munglaee, then resumed the march at noon, through torrents of rain.<sup>85</sup> Instructions were issued that the column should march in silence, 'without noise of any kind'.<sup>86</sup>

Just before four o'clock in the afternoon, two miles north of Najafgarh, Theo was in the lead, investigating another possible short cut, when he came across the advance scouts of the Nimach brigade, who immediately charged. The *sawars* cut at him, but as on 11 May, Theo managed to avoid their thrusts, and made it back safely to the main column.<sup>87</sup>

Ahead, directly in front of the British troops, on the other side of a canal, lay an old Mughal caravanserai. There the advance guard of the Nimach force were resting, guarded by nine guns, waiting for the rest of their column to catch up; well behind them, still near the Palam bridge, were Bakht Khan's Bareilly troops. Many of the sepoys were asleep; others, having piled their arms, were pitching the camp, 'and many had taken off their belts and accoutrements'.<sup>88</sup> The exhausted British troops had now

been on the road for twelve hours, and had marched some 20 miles in pouring rain, much of it wading through thick mud, and crossing two swamps 'waist-high in the water, and carrying their ammunition pouches on their heads'; but Nicholson had no hesitation in ordering an immediate assault, so as to take the sepoys unaware.<sup>89</sup>

The sepoys' guns were trained on the bridge across the canal, so Nicholson got the British troops to cross the canal by a ford to one side, and quickly formed up in two lines on the other side. Nicholson rode up and down the line shouting out to the troops to reserve their fire until close to the enemy batteries, and then to charge with fixed bayonets. 'He was answered with a cheer,' wrote Charles Griffiths, 'and the line advanced across the plain, steady and unbroken as though on parade.'<sup>90</sup>

The enemy had opened fire, and were answered by our guns, the infantry marching with sloped guns at the quick-step till within 100 yards, when we delivered a volley. Then the war cry of the British soldiers was heard, and the two regiments came to the charge, and ran at the double towards the serai.

Lt Gabbett of my regiment was the first man to reach the entrenchment, and passing through an embrasure, received a bayonet thrust in his left breast, which stretched him on the ground … [dying] of an internal haemorrhage soon after. But the men followed, clearing everything before them, capturing the four guns in the serai, bayoneting the rebels, and firing at those who had taken flight at our approach.<sup>91</sup>

Nicholson led the charge, but one of the first to engage with the sepoys was Edward Vibart. 'We stormed their position and drove them from it … capturing the whole of their camp, ammunition and baggage,' he wrote to his one surviving sister the following day.

We advanced to the charge, in the face of all their people and musketry pouring out from behind a square walled enclosure loopholed all around. With one tremendous cheer headed by our General we drove them out at the point of the bayonet – Oh I can't tell you what a maddening feeling came over me as I rushed and I

thought of our beloved parents, and burned for vengeance. It was my *first battle* and God in his mercy was again pleased to preserve me, though men close to me were struck down. A bullet even hit my sword, saving the life of a man just behind me – but what pleasure is there now in describing all this? All before us is but darkness and misery. My own darling mother's face is always before me …<sup>92</sup>

Vibart was not the only person in despair that day. When Nicholson attacked, most of the sepoys were still trudging forward, strung out along the bank of the swamp, unable to move left or right, and hemmed in fore and aft by their fellow sepoys. Even at the edge of the swamp the mud was terrible, and many were wading up to their knees in the bog. 'While thus struggling in the morass, the British guns opened upon them,' wrote Sa'id Mubarak Shah.

The grape from twelve guns now poured into the Nimach troops and the infantry and artillery became helplessly fixed in the marsh. They could neither advance nor retreat and numbers began to fall. To make matters worse they were unable to see the British guns which were dealing such destruction in their ranks, as they were hidden by trees and high standing crops. Notwithstanding the extreme difficulty of their position, the rebel artillery fired repeatedly and the sepoys also. But when men can neither advance nor retire, there is no help for them, and the brave man and the coward have nothing for it but to stop and die. On that day 470 of the Nimach brigade, horse, foot and artillery were killed by grape shot alone.<sup>93</sup>

Worse still for the future coherence of the rebel force was Bakht Khan's response when word reached him near the Palam bridge that the Nimach troops ahead had engaged the British. Three days earlier, the Nimach generals had accused him of treachery, and now he was in no hurry to come to their rescue. Instead, on hearing the guns, Bakht Khan halted the reserve. 'The real fact was that he and the officers of the Nimach force were not on good terms,' wrote Sa'id Mubarak Shah.

On this account one party desired the ruin of the other. Each leader wanted his own name alone to be famous, and himself hailed as a victor. [Luckily] the Nasirabad brigade had advanced on the right and their fire proved fatal to upwards of a hundred of the British, thereby enabling the remaining portion of the Nimach men to get out of the swamp. Had it not been for this, not a man, not even an animal belonging to that brigade would have escaped alive. Their guns fell into the hands of the British, and the mutineer army fled in utter disorder, while the round shot unceasingly harassed them in their flight. At length, staggering along exhausted and totally disorganised they reached Bakht Khan's fresh troops, and retired along with them, while the Europeans took the captured guns to pieces, placed them on elephants and carried them to their camp on the Ridge.<sup>94</sup>

For both sides it was a crucial turning point. For the first time since Badli ki Serai two and a half months earlier, the Delhi Field Force had engaged the rebel troops in an open battle, and the scale of the defeat, and the blow to rebel morale, meant that neither side had any doubt that a full-scale assault on the city was now imminent.

A week later, on 4 September, the elephants of the 8-mile-long siege train finally trundled into the British camp, pulling with them sixty heavy howitzers and mortars, preceded by long lines of 653 'hackeries' – bullock carts full of ammunition, shrapnel shell, round-shot and grape canister, much of it newly produced in the Punjab ordnance factories, which had continued to function efficiently throughout the Uprising. Many of the siege guns were so enormous – especially the six giant 24-pounders – that it took teams of elephants to pull them.\* <sup>95</sup> Accompanying the siege train were an escort of 400 European infantry, a large party of Sikh cavalry and 'the Belooch battalion, a most savage-looking lot of men', according to Charles Griffiths.<sup>96</sup>

The next day Hervey Greathed went to visit all the supplies being unpacked in the Engineers Park. Here Richard Baird-Smith, an irrigation expert from the Punjab who had been conscripted as chief engineer of the Field Force, was busy making his plans: 'The supply of shot and shell seems sufficient to grind Delhi to powder,' wrote Greathed.

I have not seen the programme of operations, but every day's work is chalked out and written down in elaborate detail. Baird Smith is not a man to forget the smallest trifle. The Engineers park is a busy scene. There are forests of gabions, and acres of fascines, all ready to be transported to the scene of action; and platform for guns and frameworks of magazines, sandbags, entrenching tools, ladders and everything requisite for the construction of batteries and for the attack.<sup>97</sup>

The following day, the British began constructing the heavy batteries that would break down the city walls, as Punjabi sappers worked under the guidance of British military engineers. It was not work that was possible to keep secret. From the walls and bastions, the rebel artillerymen targeted the construction parties; inevitably it was the Indian coolies who suffered the brunt of their shelling, while their British masters looked on with mild, detached disdain: 'with that passive bravery so characteristic of the natives,' wrote Fred Roberts, 'as man after man was knocked over, they would stop for a moment, weep a little over a fallen friend, place his body in a row along with the rest, and then work on as before'.<sup>98</sup>

![](_page_29_Picture_2.jpeg)

General Bakht Khan returned from Najafgarh in disgrace, and was abused at the durbar for having left the Nimach troops to be defeated without attempting to come to their aid. Even Zafar, increasingly detached from proceedings in recent weeks, regained some of his lucidity in the light of the disaster, and 'sent a messenger to General Bakht Khan, telling him he had been false to his salt in turning away from the field of battle'.<sup>99</sup>

For a week the army seemed on the verge of a second mutiny. There was wild talk among the sepoys of deposing Zinat Mahal – whom they rightly accused of keeping up a correspondence with the British – and replacing her as Queen with her predecessor, Taj Begum, 'unless their pay was forthcoming in fifteen days',<sup>100</sup> Zinat Mahal's father, Mirza Quli Khan, was

also briefly arrested by a group of sepoys, apparently acting on their own initiative. Others mooted the idea of deposing Zafar in favour of Mirza Jawan Bakht, who had been almost invisible throughout the siege. One day 500 sepoys gathered outside the Diwan i-Khas and accused Mirza Abu Bakr and Mirza Khizr Sultan of embezzling funds, and that they 'had taken severallakh of rupees from people in the city and given nothing to the army'. Zafar in desperation handed over all the remaining silver in the Palace to the sepoys, telling them, 'sell it, and divide the proceeds among yourselves for pay'.<sup>101</sup>

Yet as the British siege batteries inched closer and, on 8 September, began pounding the city walls, the realisation that the end was now imminent galvanised the rebel forces into the state of coherence and unity that had eluded them throughout the siege. Much of the credit for this must go to Mirza Mughal, whose office began to produce a torrent of orders for the city's defence, and issued a final appeal in his father's name for the citizens to unite against the *kafirs*: 'This is a religious war,' he wrote on the 6th, ordering that the words should be proclaimed by the beat of the drum through the city. 'It is being prosecuted on account of the faith, and it behoves all Hindu and Musalman residents of the Imperial City, or of the villages out in the country to … continue true to their faiths and creeds, and to slay the English and their servants.'<sup>102</sup>

The British siege guns were now blazing away at the northern face of the city walls: by 12 September, all sixty guns were firing round after round, as fast as they could, twenty-four hours a day: 'the din and roar were defeaning', wrote Charles Griffiths. 'Day and night salvos of artillery were heard, roll following roll in endless succession.'<sup>103</sup> It was worse still to be on the receiving end: 'The cannons and the mortars on the Ridge were constantly at work,' wrote Zahir Dehlavi. 'God alone knows how many there were. That day all the doors and walls of the city were trembling, and fire was raining from the sky. It was as if hell had been let loose on earth.'<sup>104</sup>

What the British did not know was that on the other side of the walls, Mirza Mughal had begun to construct an elaborate system of barricades and street defences, including a *damdama* or mud fort in the area in front of Kashmiri Gate, realising that once the British were within the walls, their troops would be far more vulnerable than they had ever been behind their

carefully built breastworks on the Ridge.<sup>105</sup> His plan seems to have been to encourage the British to leave their impregnable entrenchments, and lure them into the city streets, where they would lose their strategic advantage, and where cannon primed with grapeshot, as well as nests full of snipers, would be ready and waiting for them. Certainly, the British were allowed to take the ground between the Ridge and the city walls without much resistance; but once within easy range of the city walls, the rebel forces struck back with force.

Already the exposed working parties attempting to build gun platforms on the flat ground near the walls proved a more inviting target than any that had been offered to the rebels since June: 'the *kafirs* are now in range', wrote Mirza Mughal to the officers on 8 September. 'Come and give battle. We can shoot very well from the top of the walls. There should be no delay and no dereliction of duty, because the enemy is now at the gates, and everybody should courageously gird up their loins.'<sup>106</sup>

Moreover, for the first time the jihadis were able to get close enough to put their axes to work: Imdad Ali Khan, one of Bakht Khan's jihadis, was said to have displayed particular bravery, 'and although surrounded, managed to escape with considerable difficulty'.<sup>107</sup> Among those who accompanied him at this time were 'Moulvee Nawazish Ali with his 2,000 men' and a newly arrived regiment of 'suicide ghazis' from Gwalior, who had vowed never to eat again and to fight until they met death at the hands of the *kafirs*, 'for those who have come to die have no need for food'.<sup>108</sup>

One other rebel who distinguished himself at this time was Sergeant Gordon, the English convert to Islam who had been brought by the sepoys from Shahjahanpur. According to Sa'id Mubarak Shah, Gordon 'laid and fired the guns against the English batteries. The shot struck fair and true and so delighted the sepoys that they presented *nazrs* to the sergeant, who replied 'it is too late, I can do nothing now. If you had acted on my advice at the commencement, the British batteries could not have advanced a foot. Now that matters are hopeless you want me to stop their further progress. It is impossible, but I will die along with you.'<sup>109</sup>

Maulvi Sarfaraz Ali, the imam of the mujahedin, went to the court on 10 September, and said how grateful the jihadis were that at long last their 'valour and dedication' were being recognised, and that they were looking forward to participating in the coming battle with more vigour than ever. 110

According to the estimates of Hervey Greathed, owing to the number of sepoy desertions that had taken place in August, the proportion of jihadis had risen dramatically and they now numbered just under half the remaining rebel army: of the total estimated insurgent army remaining in Delhi of around 60,000 men as many as 25,000 were jihadis.\* 111

Mirza Mughal sent the town criers round the streets calling on the ordinary citizens to come and join the defence. The same call went up from the jihadis, who began touring the Delhi streets calling out, '"Citizens, citizens, all who would be martyrs for the faith come follow us …" They collected in great numbers, prepared for action and took the most solemn oath that they would go out and fight and if necessary die, but would never retreat."<sup>112</sup> On 10 September, other orders were sent to the different subahdars to rally together for the last battle: 'His Lordship the Emperor has passed an order,' wrote Mirza Mughal,

reminding the Hindus and Muslims that, for the sake of the cow and [against the defilement by] the pig, and abiding by religion and faith, if you want to make progress and earn merit in this life, then let us see whether you can prepare your infantry, cavalry and artillery and reach Kashmiri gate to attack our debased and unworthy opponents, the villainous *kafirs*. Let there be no delay in this. Act in accordance with his Lordship's orders. Act promptly. Now that you have fought on the grounds of religion and faith you should remain constant on that. Every officer should form sections of his platoon and cavalry and after arranging them should inform them of the order, and prepare for the attack. Should anybody, officer or sepoy, make any excuses please immediately send a report about them before His Lordship."<sup>113</sup>

On 11 September, the British began co-ordinating the firing of all their guns, so that the shot struck the walls simultaneously in great deafening salvoes. By midday, the city walls were finally beginning to crumble, 'sending up clouds of dust, and bringing the masonry down into the ditch'.<sup>114</sup> The guns on Kashmiri Gate were soon silent, and two large breaches opened in the curtain walls, one near the Kashmiri Bastion, the other near the Yamuna river front, at the Water Bastion. Yet despite their

hunger, the rebels fought now with a vigour that they had never shown before, sending out squadrons of cavalry from the gates to harass the coolies, engineers and gunners; in a few days, British casualties topped the 400 mark.

'Though their batteries on the bastions had been well nigh silenced,' noticed Charles Griffiths, 'the rebels stuck well to their field guns in the open space before the walls; they sent a storm of rockets from one of the Martello Towers and fired a stream of musketry from the ramparts and advanced trenches.'<sup>115</sup> Several of the British batteries caught fire and were 'left a smouldering heap of sandbags, fascines and gabions'.<sup>116</sup> Even Edward Vibart had to admit that 'the mutineers fight with an obstinancy not to be conceived, though the bastions are a heap of ruins, yet they still return our fire and their numbers are so great that day after day they come out and attack us on all sides. They will never be driven from the walls until the bayonet is brought into play'.<sup>117</sup>

By Sunday, 13 September, it was clear that the assault was imminent, and most guessed it would take place the following morning.

The British troops spent the day practising escalading with siege ladders. They also voted on who among them would become prize agents, in charge of the legalised looting of the captured city: to his own surprise, Edward Campbell received the most votes. He heard of his appointment at the new front line in the old Mughal Garden of Qudsia Bagh, opposite the Kashmiri Gate, to which he had been moved from Hindu Rao's House five days earlier.

At a meeting of the senior commanders at eleven that morning, General Wilson announced that it would be Nicholson who would lead the attack, which was provisionally set for sunrise the following morning. There were to be four columns, each directed to enter the city through a different opening on the northern face of the walls, and to head to a different goal; a fifth column was to act as reserve; to his disgust, Edward Vibart found that

he was assigned to this, and so would not take part in the assault. Theo Metcalfe, meanwhile, was to guide the column that aimed to enter the city through the Kashmiri Gate and capture the Jama Masjid, which would then be used as a base for assaulting the Palace.

For most, the evening was spent writing wills and last letters. 'I believe we are to escalade,' wrote one young officer to his anxious mother.

You know what that will be – rush up a ladder, with men trying to push you down, bayonet and shoot you from above. But you must wave your sword and think it capital fun, bring your men up as fast as you can and jump down on top of men ready with fixed bayonets to receive you. All this is not very pleasant to think coolly of, but when the moment comes excitement makes you feel as happy as possible … I hope it won't make me swear, though that is almost allowable for you are mad with excitement, and know not what you are saying. But I will strive against it with all my might.<sup>118</sup>

Edward Campbell attended the last church service that Padre Rotton was to conduct on the Ridge, as he celebrated the Eucharist – 'a deeply solemn and impressive occasion' – and preached on the text, 'I am ready to be offered', from the letter of St Paul to Timothy. But it was the Old Testament reading, foretelling the doom of 'the bloody city' of Nineveh, 'full of lies and robbery', which really appealed to Rotton, and which he spoke about at greatest length: 'Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strongholds,' he read from the Book of Nahum. 'Then shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off; it shall eat thee up like the canker worm … There is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcasses … They shall stumble upon their corpses.'<sup>119</sup>

Within the city, preparations for resisting the assault were also almost complete. Bakht Khan was busy finalising the defences in the area around the Kabul Gate that he was to command, building barricades and sandbag emplacements. That morning, he sent to his old rival Mirza Mughal, with whom he seems to have patched up a modus vivendi, asking for 200 coolies, wooden planks, baskets and gunny bags to be sent to him. Everything he asked for was promptly sent.<sup>120</sup> Mirza Mughal, meanwhile, was issuing a last order for the population of the town to resist the assault

with every weapon they could find. He also supervised clearing the two *muhallas* nearest the breaches, and sending the inhabitants to safety in other parts of the city. 121

In the Red Fort, Zafar made a point of continuing with his ceremonial duties as if nothing unusual was happening – in this case conferring the title of Safir ud-Dowlah on an ambassador come to offer the fealty of the Court of Lucknow. But in private he feared the worst: 'The King became greatly depressed when he heard that the guns on the city walls had been silenced,' wrote Sa'id Mubarak Shah, 'and taking up a Koran opened it to see what it would declare. The first passage his eye fell on was to the following effect: "Neither you nor your army, but those who were before." The old King remained silent, but Hakim Ahsanullah Khan tried to persuade him that it really meant that he would conquer in the strife.' Zafar suspected otherwise.<sup>122</sup>

Zinat Mahal, meanwhile, was at the other side of the city in her haveli in Lal Kuan, deep in last-minute negotiations with the British through Hodson's intelligence chief, Maulvi Rajab Ali. Ever since 4 August, Zafar's queen had been in regular touch with the British, putting out feelers and hoping to be able to come to terms in return for certain conditions being met. Hodson had regularly relayed developments to Sir Robert Montgomery, Lawrence's Chief of Intelligence in Lahore, reporting that Zinat Mahal 'was intriguing with British spies', was 'firmly pro-British' and had 'offered her assistance in the taking of the city' and even in 'blowing up the Bridge of Boats'.<sup>123</sup>

On 25 August, the day Nicholson had set off in pursuit of Bakht Khan, she had sent an emissary to Greathed, 'offering to exercise her influence with the King'; but Greathed had politely replied that while 'we wished her personally all happiness, and had no quarrel with women and children', he was not authorised to 'hold communication with anyone belonging to the Palace'.<sup>124</sup>

Never one to take no for an answer, Zinat Mahal now hoped she might be able to get farther by directing her communications towards Hodson. It was a shrewd move, for Hodson loved intrigue, and – though he had no authorisation – reopened communications, apparently on his own authority. On 9 September Zinat Mahal had asked for another meeting with Maulvi Rajab Ali at her haveli in Lal Kuan. By the 13th, even as her hand was

weakening by the minute as the British assault drew closer and closer, she was still holding out for her old dream, the same objective for which she had worked so tirelessly for so many years. As Hodson put it in his report, Zinat Mahal demanded in return for her assistance

that her son should be pronounced heir apparent and the succession of the throne guaranteed to him, while on the part of the King that it was demanded that his position should continue undiminished, and the arrears for the five months subsequent to the outbreak in May paid up at once.

It was with considerable difficulty that I succeeded in awakening her to the real position in which the King was placed, and the utter impossibility of either the King, or any of this family, being ever restored to the throne they had forfeited. When at length she comprehended that not only the liberty, but also that the lives of the King and his son were at stake, I succeeded in enlisting Zeenut Mahal in the cause, by guaranteeing the lives of her son and father. On this condition alone would she consent to use her influence with the King.<sup>125</sup>

While these secret negotiations were going on in Lal Kuan, Maulvi Muhammad Baqar, meanwhile, published what he strongly suspected would be the last ever issue of the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar*. The melancholy yet resigned editorial was about repentance, and not trying to understand the mysterious ways of God: 'You should not lose heart,' he advised, 'but instead draw faith and fortify your belief in the Almighty.'

Although the *Kafirs* are advancing towards us and dig a new front almost every night, the important thing is to admire the spirit and bravery of our victorious army, and to observe that they try to assault the *Kafir* positions day and night. If the Almighty is placing this impediment in our path there must be some design in it: who knows what act of arrogance or injustice we may have unknowingly committed that has caused it? We should pray to God for forgiveness and enlightenment, and we should make it a point to refrain from committing any excesses on fellow human beings, or exploiting and injuring them in any way.

It is said that the people in the city, especially the poor, are in dire straits. It is necessary at a time like this to provide relief and succour to the toiling masses so that they pray with sincerity of heart for the final victory of the Emperor's government. Remember that when the time is ripe and when he wishes it so, the Almighty will instantly bring us victory. Who knows what kind of travail and examination he wishes to subject us to, that he delays our victory so? Only He knows the unknown. The discerning and wise ones wait for his favour. 126

That evening, up on the Ridge, Robert Tytler made Harriet promise that if things went badly the following morning she would take the bullock cart with the children, and head off in good time to Ambala. 'He would have to remain with his treasure till a general rout took place,' wrote Harriet. 'It would have been about the worst spot in camp to remain alive, as the enemy would have made a rush to seize all the rupees they could … [But] if there was a reverse, I don't believe anyone could possibly have reached a place of safety. Simla would have gone, Kussowlie would have gone, and all India would have risen in arms by one consent.' Nevertheless, Robert got 'our bullocks in readiness to make a start', just in case.<sup>127</sup>

Most of the British retired early. 'There was not much sleep that night in our camp,' wrote Richard Barter. 'I dropped off now and then, but never for long, and when I woke I could see there was a light in more than one of the officers' tents, and talking was going on in a low tone amongst the men, the snapping of a lock or the springing of a ramrod sounding far in the still air, telling of preparation for the approaching strife.'<sup>128</sup>

Edward Campbell was also unable to sleep, and instead wrote what he realised might be his last letter to GG, commending himself and his family to the Almighty: 'without our God we can do nothing', he scribbled in his tent.

My precious wife, remember that we are in His hands, who has been so merciful and forbearing to us hitherto. Put your trust in thy Lord who shall yet be our salvation. I feel more and more how important it is to seek comfort in him, who alone can give true peace … The alarm has just sounded so I must give up writing and

get into my harness. May God watch over thee my darling wife, and keep us both and all dear to us.<sup>129</sup>

At midnight, the troops rose, and began to assemble in their different columns. By the light of lanterns, General Wilson's orders were read out to them. Each man was to carry 200 rounds of ammunition, and the goal of each column was outlined, as well as the route they were to take. The wounded were to be left where they fell. There was to be no plundering; all the valuables in the city would be placed in a common treasury under Edward Campbell's supervision. No prisoners were to be taken; but 'for the sake of humanity and the honour of the country', women and children were not to be hurt.

At 3 a.m., the four assault columns marched first to the Flagstaff Tower and then down in silence from the Ridge, using Zafar's fruit trees in the once lovely Mughal garden of Qudsia Bagh as cover. All this time the siege artillery and breaching batteries had been firing as rapidly as they had been for the last ten days and, according to Barter, 'the darkness before day was illuminated by constant flashes, while the air seemed alive with shells'.<sup>130</sup>

This went on for half an hour, until, as dawn broke over the horizon, the guns all fell suddenly silent together. For a second in the stillness the soldiers could hear 'small birds twittering among the trees' and smell the perfume of the orange blossom and Zafar's roses, both still 'apparent in spite of the sulphury smell of powder'.<sup>131</sup>

Then Nicholson gave the order, and after three months, the British finally advanced on the walls of Delhi.
