Nicholson's mixture of piety, gravity and courage, combined with his merciless capacity for extreme aggression and brutality, was exactly what was needed to put heart into the frustrated British troops sheltering behind their breastworks at the top of the Ridge.</p>",

'Wilson says he will assume the offensive on the arrival of the heavy guns,' Nicholson wrote to John Lawrence, 'but he says it in an undecided sort of way which makes me doubt if he will do so if he is not kept up to the mark … He is not at all equal to the crisis, and I believe he feels it himself.'</p>",

The growing British success in dealing with such mass assaults at virtually no cost to themselves was largely due to Wilson's defensive precautions.</p>",

One who did so was the articulate and intelligent Harry Gambier. Only twenty-three years old, and not long out of Eton, he had been in Delhi on 11 May, and had fled that night with Colonel Knyvett. Several days later he and Knyvett had joined up with Vibart's party, where Gambier fell head over heels in love – as so many had done before – with the lovely Annie Forrest, whom he had long admired from a distance.</p>",

In particular, the Delhi rebels failed to recognise how very easily they could have taken the British from the rear on the Ridge: 'I think Wilson has hitherto had considerable cause for anxiety,' wrote Nicholson on 28 August. 'Had the enemy had the enterprise to detach a strong force to his rear, we could not have sent more than five or six hundred men against it. But it is too late for them to try that game now, and they know it, and are at their wits' end to devise some new plan of action.'<sup>32</sup></p>",

They had created turbulence and chaos, but could not restore order. This was particularly fatal for them in the countryside around Delhi. Their failure to establish a well-governed 'liberated area' or Mughal realm from which they could draw tax revenue, manpower and, most of all, food supplies, ultimately proved the Delhi rebels' single most disastrous failure. This was something Maulvi Muhammad Baqar recognised at the time and wrote about repeatedly in his editorials: 'What strange indifference,' he wrote, 'that we have not attempted to collect one single rupee of tax revenue.'</p>",

The <i>thanadar</i> of Chandni Chowk, who was given the job of extracting the money from the bankers and <i>baniyas</i> of Katra Nil, reported 'that some of these people disappear into their houses; others do not give any response, while most make one excuse or another to keep this servant at bay, and are forever on the lookout for ways of evading their dues'.<sup>43</sup> A month later it was the same story: 'whenever this servant goes to their houses,' reported the <i>thanadar</i>, 'they shut their doors and do not give any reply. They vanish away'. A note at the bottom in Mirza Mughal's hand, and stamped with his seal, suggested a more vigorous approach: 'Proclaim an order', suggested the Prince, 'that if these money-lenders remain hidden you will blow them from a cannon.'<sup>44</sup></p>",

But rather than heading on towards Jaipur, the force would cross the Yamuna canal by the bridge near Najafgarh, and then double back to ambush the British from behind. It was exactly the sort of imaginative plan the rebels should have come up with two months earlier when the British were at their most vulnerable. By this stage Zafar was happy to agree to any plan that would remove the sepoys from his city. 'Go, may God protect you!' he said.

Had it not been for this, not a man, not even an animal belonging to that brigade would have escaped alive. Their guns fell into the hands of the British, and the mutineer army fled in utter disorder, while the round shot unceasingly harassed them in their flight. At length, staggering along exhausted and totally disorganised they reached Bakht Khan's fresh troops, and retired along with them, while the Europeans took the captured guns to pieces, placed them on elephants and carried them to their camp on the Ridge.<sup>94</sup></p>",
