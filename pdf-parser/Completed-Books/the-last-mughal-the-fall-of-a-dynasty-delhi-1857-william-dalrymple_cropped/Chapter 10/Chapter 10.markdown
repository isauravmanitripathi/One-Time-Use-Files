## **8 BLOOD FOR BLOOD**

The shelling of Delhi began on 10 June.

Initially only very slight damage was done. The British at this stage had relatively few cannon, and no large siege guns, and for most Delhiwallahs the artillery duels provided little more than entertainment. The British were hopelessly outgunned by the lines of heavy cannon massed along the bastions of the city walls and, as William Hodson himself observed on the first day of the siege, 'they are splendid artillerymen, and beat ours in accuracy of fire'.<sup>1</sup> So the people of Delhi poured out on to their flat roofs, while 'the King and the royal family took their seats at the top of the Palace' and the *salatin* watched from the bastions of the Red Fort.<sup>2</sup> 'It was hot weather at the time,' remembered Sarvar ul-Mulk, 'and every night we used to watch the glare of the cannon balls passing overhead; and we considered them pyrotechnics.'<sup>3</sup>

It was less entertaining, however, when one of the balls landed on your house, as happened a month later in Sarvar ul-Mulk's family haveli. 'A cannon-ball tore through the roof of the upper storey,' he wrote, 'and fell on

the verandah where we were having our meal. My uncle at once ran towards it and threw pots full of water onto it.'<sup>4</sup>

The Palace proved an easy target for British gunners, and one British howitzer was soon fixed permanently so as to lob shells inside Shah Jahan's red stone walls.<sup>5</sup> Zahir Dehlavi noticed the way the British were singling out the beautiful white marble royal apartments for their shelling. 'Every day there was firing from posts all along the Ridge,' he wrote,

and as they perfected their range, the shells used to create havoc on bursting. If a cannon ball fell on a several-storey building it would go in right through it to the floor, and if it fell on a flat surface it would dig deep – at least ten yards into the ground – destroying everything around it. Shells were worse: the old Shahjahani houses of the fort were completely blown apart if they received a direct hit. Later in the siege, on bad nights, it was like hell on earth, with ten shells fired at a time in the dark, and bursting one after the other<sup>6</sup>

One cannonball soon damaged the great Shah Burj tower looking out on to the Yamuna river front, while another landed near the Lal Purdah, killing a stable boy and a public crier. A third landed on the zenana apartments at the south of the Palace, where it crushed Chameli, one of Zinat Mahal's maids; soon afterwards Zinat moved out of the Fort to her private haveli in Lal Kuan, which she considered to be less exposed – and perhaps also more independent of the sepoys, who were now ubiquitous in the Palace. It also allowed her to put some physical distance between herself and her beloved only son, Mirza Jawan Bakht, on one hand, and the rebels on the other. 7

Soon after this, a volley of shells narrowly missed the Emperor himself. Sa'id Mubarak Shah, who had recently been made the kotwal in place of Muin ud-Din, was in the Palace at the time. 'About 8 o'clock one morning,' he wrote,

before the King had come out of his apartments, thirty or forty of the nobles were seated round the *hauz* [ornamental tank] in the palace courtyard waiting for his arrival. Just as the monarch emerged from his private rooms, three shells fell directly in front of and behind him and burst, but miraculously without injury to

anyone. The King immediately retired and all the others who had been seated there got up and left. That same evening the king called up the chief officers of the army and addressed them thus. 'My brothers, there is no longer any safe place for you, or the citizens of this city, or even for me to sit. The ceaseless shower of shot and shell have already prevented that for, as you see, by the very *hauz* where I was in the habit of sitting every day, the round shot and shell are now falling. You say you came here to fight and drive away the Christians. Can you not do so even so far as to stop this rain of shot and shell falling into my palace?'<sup>8</sup>

For Zafar it was the second upsetting event in a week: on 14 June his chamberlain, the chief eunuch, Mahbub Ali Khan, had died quite unexpectedly. He had been ill for some time, but Palace gossip put the death down to poison.<sup>9</sup>

Everywhere in the city, spirits were sinking. According to Sa'id Mubarak Shah, between the pillage of the rebel sepoys and the shelling of the British, the people of Delhi 'whether bad or good, well-disposed or hostile to the English, now felt that they were like rats shut in a cage, from which there was no escape'.<sup>10</sup>

![](_page_2_Picture_3.jpeg)

For Ghalib the shelling was the final straw. For the last month he had endured the sight of rustic provincials lording it over his friends in the *muhallas* of his beloved city – as he put it,

every worthless fellow, puffed up with pride, perpetrates what he will; [while] men of high rank who once in the assemblies of music and wine lit the bright lamps of pleasure and delight with the rose's fire, lie now in dark cells and burn in the flames of misery. The jewels of the city's fair-faced women … fill the sacks of vile, dishonoured thieves and pilferers … Lovers who never had to face

anything more demanding than the perverse fancies of a fair-faced mistress, must suffer now the whims of these scoundrels.<sup>11</sup>

Worse still for such an addicted letter writer was the disruption all this caused to the mail: 'The postal system is in utter chaos,' he wrote in his account of the siege, *Dastanbuy*, 'and service has virtually stopped. It is impossible for postmen to come and go: thus letters can neither be sent or received.'<sup>12</sup>

Now, to increase the poet's irritation and sufferings, there was the bombardment from the Ridge: 'The heavy billows of smoke from the firebreathing guns and lightning-striking cannons are like dark clouds hanging in the sky, and the noise is like a rain of hailstones,' he wrote.

Cannon fire is heard all day long, as if stones were falling from the skies. In noblemen's houses there is no oil for the lamps. In total darkness they must await the flash of lightning, and so find the glass and jug with which to quench their thirst … In this anarchy brave men are afraid of their own shadows, and soldiers rule over dervish and king alike.<sup>13</sup>

For most of the people of Delhi, however, the cessation of the postal service and the intermittent shelling were the least of their worries. A month after the outbreak, life was now proving very hard for the ordinary people of the city, especially the poor. With many of the bhistis and sweepers pressed into service for building and maintaining the city defences, the sanitation of the city had fallen apart: dead camels lay rotting even in the streets of the elite quarter of Daryaganj.<sup>14</sup>

The presence of sepoys billeted all over the city continued to be a problem. Even when they were not looting, fear of their violence and exactions paralysed business in the city. In July, Ratan Chand, the *daroga* (officer) of the royal estates, sent a beautifully composed Persian letter to Zafar, begging him to take action to bring Chandni Chowk back to life, 'for the militia horsemen have taken quarters in the shops at the crossroads and tied up their horses there. Therefore most of the wholesalers who rent shops have fled, and those that remain are busy emptying their shops. This means

that no income is available from rents, and even the shops that were repaired by the government have now gone out of business'.<sup>15</sup>

The rich moneylenders continued to bear the brunt. On 1 July the partners Jugal Kishor and Sheo Prasad complained that they were receiving daily visits from the cavalry, 'who come for the sake of looting, wanting to frighten us to death or imprison us. For the last three days we have been forced to go into hiding, while our employees and servants have been harassed and persecuted. Now we flee our homes in distress and confusion. All our honour and reputation has gone with the wind'.<sup>16</sup>

Yet even the most humble tradesmen found that the presence of sepoys billeted anywhere in their vicinity meant people were too frightened to come out and buy their goods. On 20 June the *thanadar* in charge of the Chandni Chowk police station, Hafiz Aminuddin, wrote to the kotwal that

the person named Anandi, a woodseller, has pleaded that for the last eleven days a cavalry regiment has been quartered near Bagh Begum where his shop is located. As a result out of fear nobody comes to his shop to purchase anything and he is losing all his income. I was therefore wondering if the said shopkeeper may be allowed to move his shop from this place. Your command shall be executed.<sup>17</sup>

Although business was at a standstill, prices were now rising fast. This had little to do with the arrival of the British, and still less to do with any plan they might have had of encircling and besieging the city. Rather, it was caused by the Gujar and Mewati tribesmen around the city, who now effectively controlled most of Delhi's hinterland. Robbing anyone who attempted to move along the roads in and out of the capital, they kept the city in a far more effective state of blockade than anything achieved by the British to the north. Typical was the experience of the Haryanvi horse trader Mehrab Khan from Sohna. Realising that his horses would be worth a premium in war-torn Delhi, he brought three mares into town. He managed to sell two of the mares to some *sawars* stationed in Daryaganj, and was riding back home on the third horse, his takings in his pocket, when 'near Mehrauli the Gujars pounced on me and looted me'.<sup>18</sup>

The result of this anarchy-induced blockade was rapidly dwindling supplies in the city and fast-rising prices. 'People are beginning to suffer greatly for want of essential commodities,' wrote Maulvi Muhammad Baqar in the first issue of the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar* to be published after the arrival of the British on the Ridge.

Even if the essentials can be found they cannot be afforded because the prices are so high. Either the shops are shut, or when they are open there are a thousand people queuing for only one hundred pomegranates. The stuff that is there is of very poor quality, but hunger is the greater master and neediness a true slave driver, so people will take what they can get and consider it a boon. As is rightly said, 'if one cannot find wheat, barley will do.'

Bitter and dirty ghee sells for two sers a rupee; flour is almost impossible to find; white wheat has become like the [mythical] Anqa bird. Even then your problems are not over: when you give it to the miller and after a thousand excuses he agrees to grind it; by the time you come back he says a Tilanga has seized it from him, and what could he do?

From the gardens inside the city, some mangoes and other produce does reach a few places, but the poor and the middle class can only lick their lips and watch as these fresh delicacies pass into the houses of the rich. The dandies of the city, and especially the ladies who are used to *paan* and tobacco suffer greatly since *paan* is now only available in one place – the bazaar outside the Jama Masjid – and there for as much as two paise a leaf, too expensive for most of us. Look at the lessons the Almighty has taught us: we used to be so fussy that we would reject the finest wheat and complain that our flour was too smelly and only good to be given to *faqirs*. Now we don't hesitate to fight for the poorest left-overs from the bazaars.<sup>19</sup>

Muhammad Baqar concluded by reverting to his favourite theme of loyalty to the Emperor, whom he refers to as God's representative on earth; and he obliquely criticises the sepoys for not paying him more respect:

Before long we can be sure that these *goras* [whities] will be put to eternal sleep, and we should pray for the realms of our Exalted Majesty, the Shadow of God on Earth, to increase many times. This King of ours is one of the leading saints of the era, and has been appointed by the divine court. He spent many years virtually in British imprisonment, and though he never incited anyone to rise up, nor coveted either the throne or riches for himself, now this divine boon has come his way, brought about by the army of God. We must be sure the King does not ever again become a prisoner in the hands of anyone, and it is incumbent on both the army and the people to treat the King's decisions as akin to the approval of God and his Prophet. No one should be in awe of the British: what they achieved was done through fraud and the breaking of their contract [of loyalty to the Mughals].<sup>20</sup>

Others took a less metaphysical attitude to the city's food shortages. The petitions presented to Zafar at this time included a number from the royal gardeners, who complained that the Tilangas were raiding their fruit trees, despite the presence of the Palace Guards:

My Lord, our crop worth Rs 1000 consisting of bananas and grapes and plums was ready, but the Tilangas came and plundered it and whatever was left they are making away with too. The guards deployed by the government at the gate of the garden are wholly ineffective because the Tilangas do not heed them at all, and when they protest they merely snatch away their guns.<sup>21</sup>

Yet for all the increasing hardship, there was nevertheless a strong undercurrent of confidence about the imminent confrontation with the small British force now entrenched on the Ridge. Once the city people had got over their shock at seeing the British return, the apparent fragility and small scale of the British Field Force soon became apparent, as did the rapidly growing strength of the rebel garrison within the city walls.

All eyes were now on the attempts of the different sepoy regiments to dislodge the hated Christians from their well-fortified entrenchments; but as the first few attempts demonstrated, it was not going to be as easy as it looked.

In the two weeks after the British returned to the Ridge, the rebel forces received several thousand reinforcements – from Ambala and Jalandhar in the north, and Haryana and Nasirabad in the west. Larger than any of these was the enormous rebel army heading slowly towards Delhi from Bareilly, 200 miles to the east. Across Hindustan, of the 139,000 sepoys in the Bengal Army, all but 7,796 had now risen against the Company, and over half were now either in Delhi or on their way to it.<sup>22</sup> There were also reports that a large force of between three and four thousand armed civilians – Jat peasant farmers who had risen up under their leader Shah Mal Jat – had just attacked the British force left to guard the bridge to the rear of the British lines at Baghpat, so cutting off the Field Force's communications, reinforcements and supplies coming to and from Meerut.

To add to British woes, and introduce a new element to the already volatile mixture of civilians, rebels and refugees gathering within the city walls, there had also arrived at Delhi several large bodies of freelance jihadis made up of a ragtag assortment of 'Wahhabi' maulvis, militant Naqshandi *faqirs* and, most numerous of all, pious Muslim civilians – especially 'weavers, artisans and other wage earners' – who believed it was their duty to free what they regarded as the *Dar ul-Islam* from the rule of the hated *kafirs*<sup>23</sup> Four hundred marched in during the first week of the siege from nearby Gurgaon, Hansi and Hissar, but much the largest contingent – well over 4,000 strong – came from the small Muslim principality of Tonk in Rajasthan, which had a history of welcoming extreme 'Wahhabi' preachers, and which had long been regarded by British intelligence officers as a hotbed of fanaticism and an underground centre of the mujahedin movement.

On arrival the jihadis set up camp both in the courtyard of the Jama Masjid and that of the riverside Zinat ul-Masajid, the most beautiful of all the Delhi mosques. It is a measure of the distrust and tension between the sepoys and the jihadis that although they often fought side by side, the sepoys seem none the less to have regularly searched individuals going in and out of both mosques, and detained several people whom they regarded

as suspicious.<sup>24</sup> Occasionally the tension between the overwhelmingly Hindu sepoys and the militantly Muslim mujahedin erupted into full-scale street fights.<sup>25</sup>

The mujahedin and their firebrand maulvis calling for jihad in the city's mosques appealed to a few of Delhi's more extreme Islamists, among whom were the 'Wahhabis' of the Punjabi Muslim community. <sup>26</sup> Sarvar ul-Mulk's Afghan tutor, a huge bear of a man, was also one of those who went off to fight with the jihadis on the Ridge:

This moulvi, a strongly built man, with a big head and hair falling down his shoulders, was an expert in telling beads and reciting prayers. One day he came to my father, and said that God Almighty had conferred a great boon on men these days, and it was a pity we did not avail ourselves of it; and when my father asked what the boon was, he replied, 'jihad and martyrdom.' My father tried to do his best to dissuade him, but he was in ecstasy for martyrdom, and finally with a turban on his head, a sword at his waist, and a rifle in his hand, he departed.<sup>27</sup>

By and large, however, the people of Delhi, already alarmed by the number of violent, unpaid and hungry sepoys gathering within their walls, remained dubious about the pleasure of hosting in addition several thousand fanatical holy warriors. This was especially so given the jihadis' far from friendly attitudes towards Delhi's Hindus – half the city's population – and the importance the Delhi elite placed on not upsetting the delicate equilibrium between Hindus and Muslims in the city: 'Their stated object was a crusade against the infidel,' wrote Sa'id Mubarak Shah, 'their real one was plunder. In this manner fully five thousand men from various quarters poured into Delhi as ghazees, the majority armed with *gundasahs* [battleaxes] and dressed in blue tunics and green turbans'.<sup>28</sup>

Such was the coolness of the reception given to the jihadis that it was not long before one of their maulvis came before Zafar to complain that they were being unjustly neglected. The petition addressed Zafar with a new title: 'Oh Generous and Affectionate Killer of the Degenerate Infidels,' wrote the maulvi. 'We Jihadis have displayed great valour and dedication but until now we have received no appreciation for it, nor have there even

been any enquiries as to how we have fared … We only hope that our services will be recognised and rewarded, so we will be able to continue to participate in the battle.'<sup>29</sup>

A similar petition came from a man who described himself as the Principal Risaldar of the Tonk Jihadis. In his case the complaint was more serious: his jihadis had been deserted by the sepoys during an assault and left to take on the *kafir* infidels all by themselves:

We joined in the attack yesterday, and 18 infidels were despatched to Hell by your slave's own hands, and five of his followers were killed and five wounded. Your Majesty, the rest of the army gave us no help whilst we were engaged in combat with the infidels. Had they even stood by, only to make a show of support, as was to have been expected, with the help of Providence a complete victory yesterday would have been achieved … I trust that now some arms, together with some trifling funds, may be bestowed on my followers, so that they might have the strength to fight and slay the infidels, and so realise their desires.

Scribbled on the back is a note by Mirza Mughal saying the imperial armoury was now empty, but to send some funds.<sup>30</sup> The money was clearly not enough: by the end of July parties of jihadis were coming before Zafar saying 'that they had no food and that they were starving'.<sup>31</sup>

The one thing that the jihadis did succeed in doing was alarming – and potentially alienating – Delhi's Hindus. Initially there had been no visible difference in the response of Delhi's Hindus and Muslims to the outbreak. During May and June, militant Hindu preachers were every bit as outspoken as their Muslim counterparts: 'in Chandni Chowk and other markets', wrote the Urdu historian Zakaullah, 'pandits were communicating commandments from the Shastras that they should fight the English *mlechchhas* [foreign barbarians]'.<sup>32</sup> One Brahmin in particular, Pandit Harichandra, seems to have been especially prominent and appears in several British intelligence reports: 'he tells the officers', reported one spy,

that by virtue of his astrological and esoteric arts he has learned that the divine forces will support the army. He has named an auspicious

day when he says there will be a terrifying fight, a new Kurukshetra [the battle at the climax of the *Mahabharat*] like the one between the Kauravas and the Pandavas of yore. He tells the sepoys that their horses' feet will be drenched in British blood and then the victory will be theirs. All the people in the army have great faith in him, so much so that the time and the place designated by the Pandit are chosen for the fighting.<sup>33</sup>

There are references to Hakim Ahsanullah Khan paying Brahmins – presumably on Zafar's instructions – to make daily prayers for victory 'before the [sacred] flame', and there is even one reference to a Brahmin who told Zafar that 'if he were placed in a well-protected house for three days and allowed whatever materials he required for creating oderous fumes he would contrive that the king would be victorious'. Zafar appears to have been appropriately impressed and duly gave him what he needed.<sup>34</sup> In all the proclamations of the Mughal court emphasis was laid again and again on Hindu-Muslim unity, on 'the fight about the cow and the pig', and for *'din* and *dharma*'. One revolutionary pamphlet called *Fath e-Islam* (The Victory of Islam), despite its title, emphasised the need for cooperation and co-existence between Hindus and Muslims and the degree to which its author believed the Mughal emperors had always looked after their Hindu subjects:

The Hindus should join the Emperor with a view to defending their religion, and should solemnly pledge themselves; the Hindus and Mahomedans, as brethren to each other, should also butcher the English, in as much as the Mahomedan Kings protected the lives and property of the Hindus with their children in the same manner as they protected those of the Mahomedans, and all the Hindus with heart and soul were obedient and loyal to the Mahomedan Kings … The Hindus will remain steadfast to their religion, while we also retain ours. Aid and protection will be offered by us to each other. 35

In the same way, many of the sepoy regiments mixed Hindus and Muslims, to the extent that, as Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan later noted, they came to consider each other as brothers.<sup>36</sup> Indeed, some Hindu sepoys started using

Islamic language in their petitions to court, talking of the Uprising as a jihad, and describing the British as *kafirs.\* 37*

Nevertheless, as the numbers of the jihadis in the city increased and the Uprising in Delhi assumed an increasingly Islamic flavour, so the dormant underlying tensions seem to have were exacerbated, and many Hindus became increasingly anxious and disturbed. Certainly some of the jihadis were convinced 'that the entire Hindu population is with them [the British]', and that 'the money changers and Hindus were in alliance with the Christians'.<sup>38</sup> There is also a telling petition to Zafar from one elderly begum who clearly saw the Uprising as little more than an excuse for provincial Hindus to come and loot her haveli. 'Please send five mounted guards of the Turk variety [i.e. Muslims],' she asks Zafar, whom she addresses as 'dear relative, apple of my eye, corner of my liver', 'to protect me from evil and corruption of the Hindus. For as you know, the Hindus of the Sita Ram Bazaar are ill-disposed to us and have a deceitful headman full of trickery. God forbid that the Hindus might by trickery introduce some spy into the army, and so have my house plundered and looted.'<sup>39</sup>

Against this background, it is probably no coincidence that soon after the arrival of the jihadis, Maulvi Muhammad Baqar included in his columns a call for the Hindus of the city not to lose heart – which of course implied that he suspected that they were beginning to do just that. A remarkable letter aimed at his Hindu readers was included in Baqar's issue of 14 June. In it, he called for all Delhi's citizens to pull together against the common British enemy, whom he compared to Ravana, the demon king in the Hindu epic the *Ramayana*. 'O my countrymen,' he wrote,

Looking at the strategy and devious cleverness of the English, their ability to make arrangements and to order the world in the way they wish, the wide expanses of their dominions and their overflowing treasuries and revenues, you may feel disheartened and doubt that such a people could ever be overcome. But my Hindu brothers, if you look in your Holy books you will see how many magnificent dynasties have come into being in the land of Hindustan, and how they all met their end. Even Ravana and his army of demons was beaten by Raja Ramchandra [the Hindu king and deity, Lord Ram] … Except the Adipurush, the primaeval Deity, nothing is permanent …

If God brings all these magnificent kingdoms to an end after a short period, why do you not comprehend that God has sent his hidden help [to defeat] this hundred-year-old kingdom [of the British], so that this community [the Christians] who regarded the children of God with contempt, and addressed your brothers and sisters as 'black men', have now been insulted and humiliated? Realise this, and you will lose your fear and apprehension. To run away and turn your back now would be akin to denying divine help and favour …<sup>40</sup>

![](_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)

The jihadis may have alarmed the Hindus, but in the weeks to come their suicidal bravery often put the sepoys to shame – especially when some of the most prominent jihadis turned out to be women. According to a surprised and impressed Sa'id Mubarak Shah,

Several of these fanatics engaged in hand to hand combat, and great numbers were killed by the Europeans. Frequently two old withered Musalman women from Rampur would lead the rebels going far in advance with naked swords, bitterly taunting the sepoys when they held back, calling them cowards and shouting to them to see how women went in front where they dared not follow: 'we go without flinching among the showers of grape you flee from.' The sepoys would excuse themselves saying 'We go to fetch ammunition,' but the women would reply 'you stop and fight, and we will get your ammunition for you.' These women frequently did bring supplies of cartridges to the men in the batteries, and walked fearlessly in perfect showers of grape, but by the will of God were never hit. At length, one of the two was taken prisoner … When the band of ghazees moved off to the assault, the women invariably went in advance of all.<sup>41</sup>

The reason for the repeated failure of the attacks on the Ridge, it soon became clear, was not any lack of bravery so much as the absence of any

real strategic imagination, ingenuity or co-ordination. 'The insurrection would have died out, but for the constant fresh infusion of mutinous troops,' wrote Hervey Greathed on 25 June. 'They get beaten in detail, and apparently fight without any defined object.'<sup>42</sup> Moreover, the same problem that frustrated all attempts to restore order in the city – the lack of a clear and recognised figure of executive authority – also wrecked their attempts at fighting coherently or effectively.

From the very first day of the British return to the Ridge, the rebels had daily poured out of the Lahore Gate on the western side of the city, and made their way up the slope of the Ridge, usually through the western suburb of Sabzi Mandi (the vegetable market), in full view of their British adversaries. There they mounted a series of fearless frontal attacks on the British position, usually directing their full fury at the key British strongpoint on the front line – the white Palladian mansion erected in happier times by William Fraser, and now known after its subsequent owner as Hindu Rao's House.

Yet despite the sepoys' often insane bravery, time and time again they were driven back by the Gurkhas, who had been billeted in the house and who had quickly and artfully fortified it. It was a strong position, and behind their sandbags the Gurkhas were determined to hold it: 'we heard this morning that two new regiments of mutineers had arrived in the city', wrote Major Reid, the Gurkha commander, on 13 June, four days into the siege.

[We were told] that they were being armed and would attack us at 4pm. Sure enough, on they came … I was all ready for them, and allowed them to come within twenty paces, when I opened with grape and musketry on all sides. I charged them with a couple of companies … over the hill … My loss 3 killed and II wounded; 3 right arms amputated … They marched up the Grand Trunk Road in columns headed by the Sirdar Bahadoor of the regiment, who made himself very conspicuous, calling out to his men to keep distance, as he intended to wheel to his left. They fought most desperately. The Sirdar Bahadoor of the 60th was killed by my orderly Lall Sing. I took the Ribbon of India from his breast. The mutineers were about 5000 strong, infantry and cavalry. 43

The courage of the sepoys invariably impressed their old officers; their tactics did not. The massed bodies of troops certainly looked magnificent when seen from the city walls – Zahir Dehlavi thought the contest was 'a strange and fascinating war which one had never heard of or seen before, for both the armies belonged to the British government, and the rebels had also been trained by the experienced English Officers, so that it was like a fight between a teacher and his student'.<sup>44</sup> But the sepoys' uncoordinated attacks, single regiment after single regiment, taking it in turn to attack the prepared British positions front on, day after day, rarely taxed the British despite their small numbers. Hodson was being characteristically dismissive and overconfident when he claimed, 'they do little more than annoy us, and the only great evil they cause is keeping our men out for hours in this scorching heat'.<sup>45</sup> Nevertheless, the sepoys' strategy did strikingly fail to make use of their overwhelming numerical advantage and reflected the fact that, owing to army regulations, none of the rebel leaders had any training in commanding units above company (100 men) level, nor had they learned how to run the larger logistical or strategic sides of a big military operation. To make matters worse, each morning the ground gained the day before had to be regained, for each night the sepoys returned to sleep in the city and in their different camps, beyond the range of British cannon, leaving the Ridge and its approaches in British hands.

At this stage in the siege, the jihadis made even less impression than the sepoys, since they rarely got close enough to the British trenches to use their axes. According to the great *Times* correspondent William Howard Russell, who saw them in action to the east of Delhi,

The Gazees were fine fellows, grizzly-bearded elderly men for the most part, with green turbans and cummerbunds, and every one of them had a silver signet ring, [with] a long text of the Koran engraved in it. They came on with their heads down below their shields, and their *tulwars* flashing as they whirled them over their heads, shouting 'Deen! deen!' [The Faith!] and dancing like madmen. The champion as he approached shouted out to us to come on, and got within a yard of the line amid a shower of bullets. Then a young soldier stepped out of the ranks, blazed away with his Enfield between his two eyes, and followed it by a thrust of the bayonet in the face, which finished the poor champion.<sup>46</sup>

Initially the scale of the losses did not seem to matter to the rebels, given that new arrivals were daily pouring into the rebel camp, swelling the rebels' numbers – and filling the shoes of those mown down each morning. But as the siege dragged on from June into July, the enthusiasm of the sepoys to face either the grapeshot of the British artillery or still less the kukhris and bayonets of the Gurkhas understandably diminished. Among the Mutiny Papers, orders start to appear that indicate a slackening of rebel enthusiasm. One petition from the keepers of the shrine of Qadam Sharif complains that the sepoys were shirking their duties and hiding in the shrine; while there, they threatened the *pirzadas* (custodians of the Sufi shrine) and plundered planks, beams, rings and cots: 'they have already rendered desolate the habitations of the birdcatchers, limemakers and several others. But if we try to stop them from coming here, they show their guns to us and threaten to kill us …'<sup>47</sup>

More telling still is a desperate order from Mirza Mughal in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief, dating from as early as 23 June, begging the sepoys to finish the work they have begun. The order is addressed 'To all the Officers of the Platoons and the Sawars who have not gone to the trenches'.

Despite the fact that this war started over faith and religion, many of you have not gone to battle, and instead while your time away in gardens or shops. Others are hiding inside their quarters, protecting their lives. His Highness the Emperor has made you all swear on his salt that all the platoons would go on the attack and annihilate the Kafirs, but you no longer show the will to do so. How sad that when this confrontation is about religion and faith, and when His Highness gave you his protection, you still refrain from going for battle. Remember, the platoon that does not go to battle will have its allowances stopped from tomorrow, but those platoons and cavalry units who show courage and fortitude today, and indeed have showed it before, will receive rewards, medals and honours from the Court. Moreover His Highness the Emperor will be highly gratified.

To this same order is added a postscript:

To All the Officers of the 2nd Platoon,

The order had been issued to you that you should go towards Teliwara and attack. But it has now been learnt that that you did not go to the front and instead are currently lounging in the gardens near there. This is completely unacceptable. You should go there immediately and destroy the *Kafirs.<sup>48</sup>*

The saddest aspect of the slaughter faced every day by the sepoys was that, without realising it, they had actually found the Achilles heel of the British early on in the siege. On 19 June, the sepoys broke from their normal routine to mount a far more imaginative night assault on the Ridge from three directions, stretching British resources to their limits. An hour before sunset, a major surprise attack began from the rear of the Ridge, coming not just from the Sabzi Mandi but also from Mubarak Bagh to the north-west, and Metcalfe House to the east, and led by the well-equipped rebel force from Nasirabad. The fight continued all night, allowing the British no time to recover their strength. According to the British chaplain, the Reverend John Rotton,

The enemy came out in overwhelming numbers, with artillery, cavalry and infantry … We often wondered that such [rear] attacks were never made by them, and made systematically and regularly: their effect must have told on us in the end, if not much sooner than we foresaw … We remained fighting desperately, under a very severe and unpleasant fire; the darkness of night coming on apace …

The result of this engagement made a very melancholy impression on most men's minds in camp; not because our success was questionable, though very dearly bought, but rather because it was at first naturally regarded as the enemy's mode of intimating to us the plan he intended to pursue in future: that his eyes were open to the advantage he might gain over us, if he only harassed us in the rear. The fact is that knowing our own weakness better than our opponent did, we were not without fears, which luckily, proved groundless.<sup>49</sup>

It was a measure of the rebels' critical lack of intelligence that they had no idea quite how close to victory they had come so early in the siege. Fatally for themselves, the rebels never made another attempt to mount a really concerted attack on the British rear until much later; and by then it was too late.

At the beginning of July, Theo Metcalfe's brother-in-law Edward Campbell arrived on the Ridge and was posted near Hindu Rao's House, just in time to face the full fury of a major sepoy attack. Like everyone else in the British camp, he was profoundly shaken by the precariousness of the British position. The following evening he picked up his pen and wrote to his pregnant wife GG in Simla. The last time he had been in Delhi was five years earlier, at Christmas, when he was courting her at the far end of the same Ridge, in Metcalfe House, under the disapproving eyes of Sir Thomas.

The letter began with family news: GG had written asking for more details of Theo's escape, and about how the family's two Delhi houses now looked: 'Have you been over the ruins of the old house? Is the Kootub House destroyed?'<sup>50</sup> In reply, Campbell explained that Theo had been sent out with Hodson's Horse almost simultaneously with his own arrival, and that they had yet to have a proper conversation: her brother was now off disarming some villages to the rear of the British position. But Theo's eyes had become swollen and painful again, Campbell told GG, and he thought his brother-in-law should take leave and go up to Simla to recover properly from the ordeal of his escape from Delhi. This would also allow him to help look after his pregnant sister. 'I cannot see the use of his being here,' added Campbell, 'except for the information he gives of the country, which they do not seem to care much [about].'<sup>51</sup>

Metcalfe House, he went on, was totally gutted, and its shell now formed the easternmost picket of the British position, abutting the bank of the Yamuna. So bad was the damage that Campbell thought that the looters had gone as far as 'lighting a fire in each room … the only roof left is on

[Theo's old] Batchelor's Bungalow'. But there was better news from Dilkusha: 'We sent out some men to see the Kootub House,' he wrote, 'and they say, it is alright, it has not been looted and the servants are all there – it is very strange is it not?'

Edward knew this would mean a lot to GG, who, like the rest of the family, had been deeply upset by the loss of their much-loved family home. It also meant something to them financially, for like many other British families in Delhi they had lost almost all their assets on 11 May. Theo had been much criticised within the family in the months leading up to the outbreak for failing to get on with the auction of his father's library and artworks.<sup>52</sup> In the event it had made little difference: what had been auctioned had been placed in the family account at the Delhi Bank, whose books and assets had gone up in flames several hours before Metcalfe House. Now at least there was a prospect that some of their father's belongings might yet be saved intact from their other house near Mehrauli.

Having passed on that piece of good news, Campbell then went on to give GG a gloomy assessment of the current British position on the Ridge.

The Pandies came out at about 8 o'clock and kept up a vigorous attack on the advanced batteries in front of Hindoo Rao's house … Our principal danger was from round shot and shell – the hottest fire I have ever experienced.

I had to keep up a sharp fire all day to prevent the mutineers sneaking round to our left where we were very weak. It was an anxious time for me for I could not help feeling what a critical position it was. Our rifle companies are now so weak – I have only 30 men fit for duty, instead of about 70. I had about 4 men wounded none killed, thank God. I have much to be thankful for myself – for the narrow shaves were many – and besides the direct fire of the Pandies who kept trying to creep up to us, we had an incessant shower of spent bullets passing over us and hitting the rocks on all sides. I had one sergeant shot through the arm, one man wounded in the hand and another in the neck … Morgan, my junior sub got a touch of a spent ball in the leg – one man got a bullet through his cap, another a bit of shell thro his haversack, and another a splinter of a shell in his leg …

Just as Maulvi Muhammad Baqar had promised his readers that divine support was clearly with the rebels, so Campbell now went on to assure GG that God was on the side of the British: 'I trust my God will comfort my little wife,' he wrote,

for his comfort is the only real one, the only one which will stand all tests. You have managed so well there on your own, GG, and you must not be over afraid of the taking of Delhi, dearest. You know, I always told you I thought it would be a long affair, and from what I see of the natural as well as artificial defences of the Palace, I think we cannot take it satisfactorily, or do any good to the country until a larger force is collected – a larger siege and a larger supply of ammunition for our guns. I think an assault under present circumstances could not but be disastrous.

I think the hand of God has been manifestly with us … I trust He will always make me do my duty bravely and honourably. I cannot feel the pleasure that others tend to do here, in looking at the dead mutineers. They are also all God's creatures and I feel that much of the slaughter must be laid to our account. Pray Heaven that we may be humbled by God's Grace.<sup>53</sup>

Campbell's anxieties reflected a growing realisation among the British on the Ridge. They had come to besiege, but clearly now did not have the numerical strength either to encircle or to take the town, and had no option but somehow to cling on and endure whatever the rebels threw at them until such a time as relief came. In the meantime, there were around 4,000 government troops against more than 20,000 rebels whose numbers were increasing every day. As General Wilson wrote to his wife, 'We are still remaining in the same uncertainty as to what we are to do now we are here … Frankly I doubt we have the means to take Delhi, and that without the merciful assistance of the Almighty, I fear the result. I trust He will not forsake the cause of His own people …'<sup>54</sup>

If there was some frustration with the current stalemate in the city, then there was much more so on the Ridge. 'We go pottering about perfectly aware that we can do nothing else,' wrote Fred Roberts. 'This hanging about Delhi is very disheartening: [it] would be nothing if we could have a

good fight and have done with it, but these Pandies are innumerable and never become less.'<sup>55</sup>

Unlike the townspeople, the British had a fairly regular supply of food, coming down the Grand Trunk Road from Ambala in armed convoys; but in almost every other way their situation was worse than that of the Delhiwallahs below them. Quite apart from the daily attacks and the constant bombardment from the city, the troops of the Field Force had no shelter or shade except their tents, so that many of the troops 'died from apoplexy and sunstroke, their faces turning quite black in a couple of minutes – a horrible sight'.<sup>56</sup> There was no water, except for the Yamuna canal a mile to the rear, where the flow 'were it not for the [revolting] flavour, would have passed for pea soup'. Sewage arrangements were primitive in the extreme.

After a week or two, the smell of the bloated, blackening, rotting bodies of the sepoys piled high on the slopes leading up to the Ridge grew more and more insupportable, and the rock was too hard to allow the digging of anything but the most shallow graves. 'The day before yesterday I had the most wretched picquet,' wrote one soldier to his mother. 'There were about fifteen dead Pandies within ten yards in a state of decay, and stench was quite over powering, inhaling it as we did for 38 hours.'<sup>57</sup> The small parties of British reinforcements arriving from the Punjab would always smell that they were nearing the city long before they could see it: 'Through our nasal organs, we were most painfully aware of the scenes we were about to enter upon,' wrote Colonel George Bourchier as he neared Delhi. 'From Alipore to the camp, death in every shape greeted our approach; even the trees, hacked about for the camel's food, had a most desolate appearance, throwing their naked boughs towards heaven as if invoking pity for themselves or punishment on their destroyers.'<sup>58</sup>

The flies were another feature of the camp which few could forget. 'They sought you out in your tent, at your meals, when occupied in the discharge of duty,' wrote Padre Rotton, the camp chaplain.

Whatever might be the dish you selected to feed upon, as soon as it was uncovered, a legion of flies would settle upon it; and even so simple a thing as a cup of tea would be filled in a few minutes, unless you were very careful, the surface of the liquid presenting a

most revolting dark appearance from the flies floating thereon, some dead, others dying.<sup>59</sup>

The sheer filthiness of life in the Ridge camp also horrified a young lieutenant, Charles Griffiths, who had just arrived from Ferozepur. Like Rotton, he immediately conceived a deep hatred for the flies, which seemed to be impossible to avoid. Many days, he wrote, began by being woken not by the sound of bugles or exploding shells, but with the sensation of flies crawling through your sleeping lips:

They literally darkened the sky, descended in myriads and covering everything in our midst. Foul and loathsome they were, and we knew that they owed their existence to, and fattened upon, the putrid corpses of dead men and animals which lay rotting and unburied in every direction. The air was tainted with corruption and the heat was intense. Can it, then, be wondered that pestilence increased daily in our camp, claiming its victims from every regiment, native as well as European?<sup>60</sup>

Things grew worse after the monsoon broke on 27 June and overnight transformed the Ridge into what Griffiths dubbed 'a swamp and mudhole' and Hodson 'a steaming bog'. 'The camp was literally turned into a pool,' wrote Rotton in his diary, 'and became very offensive to the sense of smell.' Snakes, driven out of their holes, suddenly multiplied and were 'dreaded almost [as much as] if not more than the enemy's missiles'. Black scorpions 'like young lobsters' were regularly found crawling through the bedding.<sup>61</sup> At night sleep was all but impossible: if the damp heat and the smell were not enough, the boom of cannon, the baying of jackals and dogs, and what the *Delhi Gazette Extra* described as 'the gurgling moan of obstinate camels' made rest a distant hope. <sup>62</sup> More seriously, in this humid, stinking, stagnant quagmire, cholera also broke out again, passing through the camp with astonishing and deadly speed.63 In such an unhealthy environment, and with only the most basic medical facilities, it was hardly surprising that almost none of the many wounded who had to go through an amputation survived to tell the tale.

The officers at least had access to a regimental mess, a courtesy that was denied to the starving Christian and Anglo-Indian refugees who made it to the camp: Padre Rotton described his horror at seeing their 'attenuated limbs, sunken and glazed eyes, drawn and pinched features, convulsive frame'.<sup>64</sup> The regimental mess was also denied to the heavily pregnant Harriet Tytler and her children, who were forced to live in the cart containing the army treasure chest her husband had to guard. 'We had no home outside of our cart,' she wrote. 'There we remained night and day, eating our meals in our laps.'<sup>65</sup> It was a dangerous and exposed position, and before long

a shell exploded quite close to the cart and a huge piece fell below the wheel, but thank God none of us were hurt … Captain Willock came over in the evening to see us. When a shell came over the Flagstaff Tower, whizzing as it came along until it fell within the mud walls of our sepoys' lines close to where we were, and exploded there, poor Captain Willock jumped up saying, 'My God what was that?' I replied calmly, 'Oh! It is only a shell.' He was so astounded at the indifferent way I took it that he repeated it at the mess, after which it became a byword in the camp: 'Oh! It is only a shell.' Poor fellow, he never lived long enough to discover how accustomed one can get to such sounds from hearing them night and day.

It was in her cart that Harriet gave birth to a son, at two in the morning on 21 June. It was not the joyful moment that such events usually are: 'My baby was born with dysentery,' wrote Harriet sadly (she had already seen several of her children die in India),

and [he] was not expected to live for nearly a week. When the child was out of immediate danger, the kind-hearted doctor said: 'Now, Mrs Tytler, you may think of giving him a name.' Poor child, a pauper to begin with, his advent into this troublesome world was not a promising one. There he lay, near the opening of the van, with only a small square piece of flannel thrown over him, the setting moon shining brightly on his little face and nothing but the sound of alarms, calls and shot and shell as lullabies.<sup>66</sup>

When the monsoon broke a week later, and water began coursing through the thatched roof of the cart, Harriet's husband Robert moved her and the baby into an empty bell of arms,\* whose floor he covered for them with straw. 'I walked bare-footed with a wet sheet wrapped around my baby, and went into that bell of arms and there we remained,' she wrote.

After such an experience I quite expected the baby and myself would die, but through God's mercy we were none the worse and I was able to nurse my baby without the usual aid of a bottle of milk, there being neither bottles nor milk for love or money. We slept on the floor with only straw and a razai [quilt] under us, with no pillows to comfort us, till a poor officer who had been killed had his property sold, and my husband bought his sheets … [But] my baby never winked or blinked, sleeping through it all as he lay on his bed of straw. If he had laid on a feather bed in a palace he couldn't have slept more soundly<sup>67</sup>

Pressed to choose an appropriate name for the child, Harriet came up with something as idiosyncratic as her circumstance: Stanley Delhi Force Tytler.

As July and the rains progressed, and the British breastworks and fortifications became over time increasingly sophisticated, more and more British began to die of cholera rather than sepoy bullets. It was part of Padre Rotton's daily duties to make regular visits to the two cholera wards of the camp hospitals. 'It required strong nerves to withstand the sickening sights of these two infirmaries,' he wrote afterwards.

The patients constantly retching made the place very offensive. The flies alighted on your face, and crawled down your back, through the opening given by the shirt collar, and occasionally also flew into your throat when you were reading with a dying man … My Bible,

sadly marked in consequence of this plague, recalls every time I open its soiled pages many a painful countenance which I witnessed within those walls … So general was this mortal sickness in these hospitals, that at last I could only hope to discharge my duty by taking up a central position, with a chair for a hassock to kneel on in prayer, and make a general supplication for all the patients, while afterwards, with Bible in hand, I read and expounded some appropriate passage of scripture …<sup>68</sup>

On 5 July, cholera claimed its second British general: having killed General Anson in Kurnal in May, it now removed his successor, General Barnard, as well. If both Anson and Barnard seemed inadequate leaders for the crisis in hand, then the third elderly commander to take the lead, General Sir Thomas Reed, was the worst of all: 'old and feeble,' thought Wilson, 'more fit for the invalid couch than assuming command'.<sup>69</sup> Others put it more bluntly. 'I don't see how we are ever going to get inside Delhi,' wrote the young Scottish Lieutenant Thomas Cadell from East Lothian, 'under the choice collection of muffs we have at our head.'<sup>70</sup>

As was predicted by Hervey Greathed the day Reed took over, the elderly general was 'too ill to do anything'<sup>71</sup> A week later he was still languishing in his tent: 'we see or hear nothing of General Reed', wrote Greathed to his wife. 'I wish I could say the same of a horse he has just bought, picketed close by; it has been roaring for the last two hours.'<sup>72</sup> It was not long before Reed gave up the struggle completely, and opted instead for retirement in Simla. He left the Ridge on the I7th, after less than two weeks in charge, along with a caravan of sick and wounded; his last actions were to send away two units of nearmutinous cavalry who looked likely to desert, and to hand over command to General Wilson.

Wilson, though always overcautious and far from imaginative, proved himself a towering strategic genius in comparison with his three predecessors. He was under no illusions about the difficulty of the task given to him. As he wrote to his wife when he heard of his appointment, 'Oh! Ellen dear, this a fearful responsibility that has been thrown on my shoulders, and knowing as I do my own weakness and incapacity, I feel as if I should faint under the burden.'<sup>73</sup> Yet for all his lack of energy and confidence, Wilson was a clear military thinker and was able to see that the

British had for the moment no option but to choose a defensive strategy, and preserve their position until reinforcements arrived from the Punjab.

He therefore forbade the sort of adventures that had been whittling away British numbers, such as costly and often undisciplined counter-attacks or 'rat hunting', chasing the retreating sepoys down the hill into the gardens of the Sabzi Mandi: two of these counter-attacks had recently come near to disaster, losing 220 men on one occasion, and a further 200 only five days later. He also systematically went about improving the quality of the breastworks, defences and entrenchments, and demolishing the bridges over the Yamuna canal at the back of the British position so as to avoid any possibility of further surprise attacks from the rear. 74

On 18 July he wrote a desperate letter to Sir John Lawrence in Lahore, outlining the seriousness of the British position, and the need, whatever the cost, for Lawrence to send reinforcements to the Ridge immediately:

## Confidential:

## Sir,

I have consulted with Colonel Baird-Smith, the chief engineer of the force, and we have both come to the conclusion that any attempt now to assault the city of Delhy must end in our defeat and disaster.

The force consists at present of 2200 Europeans and 1500 natives, a total of 3700 bayonets, while the insurgents are numberless, having been reinforced by the mutinous regiments from every quarter. They are in a perfect state of preparation with strong defences and well equipped … The insurgents have attacked our positions twenty different times, and this day, they are out again making their twenty-first attack. It is true, they have been invariably driven back, but we have lost a great many men in doing so in killed and wounded …

I have determined to hold out the position we now have to the last, as I consider it of the utmost importance to keep the insurgents now in Delhy from over-running the country. To enable me however to hold this position I must be strongly reinforced, and that speedily. I hear that there is no chance of relying from the forces collecting below [from Calcutta]. I therefore earnestly call upon

you, to send me as quickly as you can such support as you can from the Punjab: a complete European regiment if possible, and one or two Seikh or Punjaubee regiments. I candidly tell you that unless speedily reinforced this force will soon be so reduced by casualties and sickness that nothing will be left, but a retreat to Kurnaul. The disasters attending such an unfortunate proceeding, I cannot calculate.

May I request an immediate reply by telegraph stating what aid in reinforcements you can afford me and when I may expect them to join my camp,

Yrs etc Archdale Wilson<sup>75</sup>

One reason for Wilson's extreme gloom was the arrival at the Bridge of Boats, on 1 July, of the largest rebel force the British had yet encountered. From the Ridge the columns of the Bareilly brigade could be seen stretching back as far as the eye could see, before they disappeared into the heat haze. The force consisted of no fewer than four regiments of foot – around 2,300 men, as well as 700 cavalry, 600 artillery guns, including some much-needed horse artillery, 14 elephants, 300 spare horses, a train of a thousand bullock carts and camels carrying tents, ammunition and supplies, treasure worth 400,000 rupees and, bringing up the rear, a further 'three or four thousand ghazis'<sup>76</sup>

On the 2nd these troops marched in across the Bridge of Boats, welcomed at the Calcutta Gate with fruit and sweetmeats by Zinat Mahal's father, Nawab Quli Khan. As the British looked on helplessly through their binoculars, they marched in, colours flying, their sepoy bandsmen playing 'Cheers Boys Cheers!' – the very same tune to which a much smaller British force from Ferozepur had marched into the British camp that morning.<sup>77</sup> 'There was no open place in the city sufficient for this vast assemblage,' noted Sa'id Mubarak Shah, 'so the brigade encamped outside

the Delhi Gate [south of the city] … This was found necessary as the crowds of sepoys already in the town were occupying all the houses and most of the shops. The entire 73rd NI had for example taken over the whole of the Ajmeri Bazaar – with six or seven sepoys [billeted] in every shop.'<sup>78</sup>

Just as important as the sheer scale of the Bareilly force was its leadership: two men who seemed capable of providing the direction and unity that had so far been eluding the rebels. One of these two was a subahdar of artillery, Bakht Khan, a much-garlanded and battle-hardened veteran of the Afghan wars. A tall, portly and heavily built man of Rohilla stock, with huge handlebar moustache and sprouting sideburns, Bakht Khan had been elected general by the Bareilly troops, and arrived in Delhi with a reputation both as an administrator and an effective military leader.

As chance would have it, Bakht Khan was known personally to several of the British officers on the Ridge. Colonel George Bourchier had learned Persian from him at his house in Shahja hanpur and wrote that he was 'very fond of English society … [and] a most intelligent character'.79 Others were less generous: some British officers dismissed him as fat, socially ambitious and, most damning of all to the military men on the Ridge, 'a bad horseman'.

The other rebel leader was Bakht Khan's spiritual mentor, the Islamist preacher Maulvi Sarfaraz Ali. The maulvi, who was now already known as 'the imam of the Mujahedin', had spent many years in Delhi and was well connected to both the court and the city. He had been one of the first clerics to preach the jihad against the British in the days leading up to the outbreak: on 1 May at Shahjahanpur he made a speech telling his audience, '… Our religion is now in danger. Having lost the sovereignty of the land, having bowed in subjection to the impure *kafir*, shall we surrender the inalienable privileges which we received from the Prophet, upon whom be peace?'<sup>80</sup>

Yet crucially, before that, Sarfaraz Ali had taught in Delhi at Mufti Sadruddin Azurda's madrasa, the Dar ul-Baqa, to the south of the Jama Masjid, where thanks to his learning in algebra and geometry he had become one of the most respected members of the Delhi *'ulama;* indeed, before the Mutiny, he was singled out by Sayyid Ahmad Khan for praise as one of the brightest jewels in Delhi's intellectual crown.<sup>81</sup> The nature of the relationship between Sarfaraz Ali and Bakht Khan before the outbreak is unclear, but according to some sources it was Sarfaraz Ali who persuaded

Bakht Khan to join the rebellion; certainly by the time the army reached Delhi, Bakht Khan was firmly under his influence. Nor was Bakht Khan alone: the four thousand jihadis who came with the army also looked to the maulvi for spiritual direction. If anyone could unite the sepoys, the jihadis and the Delhi elite, here potentially were the two men to do it.

There may have been mixed opinions about Bakht Khan up on the Ridge, but Zafar and his advisers seem to have had no such doubts. Within a day of their arrival, Bakht Khan and Maulvi Sarfaraz were summoned to the Palace and given a state reception. It was in the course of this reception that some of Bakht Khan's less diplomatic qualities first surfaced. For like many 'Wahhabis', Bakht Khan disdained earthly rulers, whom he regarded as unIslamic, and longed instead for a properly Islamic regime.

Bakht Khan and the maulvi arrived with 250 of their officers, all in full dress uniform, and disrespectfully rode straight past the Diwan i-Am into the private apartments without dismounting.<sup>82</sup> It was clear that whatever his qualities on the battlefield, and however energetic an administrator he might be, Bakht was certainly no diplomat; soon his discourteous attitude to the Emperor's court immediately began to ruffle feathers. Hakim Ahsanullah Khan was present at the audience, and was not impressed: 'Bakht Khan presented himself before the King,' he wrote,

along with the officers of his regiment and the jihadis who were with him. But contrary to etiquette he did not make his obeisance at the *Lal Pardah* [the Red Curtain at the entrance to the King's private apartments], nor did his companions, and though many people remonstrated with him, he paid no attention. When he came near the King's chair in the Diwan-i Khas, he salaamed as though to an equal, and merely taking his sword from his side, he presented it to the King. The King was appalled by this lack of courtesy, but praised the bravery of his troops …

[Two of Bakht Khan's officers] said, 'Your Majesty should bestow a sword and buckler on Bakht Khan, for he deserves them and such a favour is proper for such a chief.' At first the King excused himself saying that they are not ready, but being importuned called for them from the armoury, and bestowed them on Bakht Khan. But even then he offered no *nazr* to the King. [Instead] he said, 'I hear you have given the Princes jurisdiction

over the army. That is not good. Give the power to me, and I will make all the proper arrangements. What do these people know of the customs of the English army?' The King answered, 'The Princes were appointed at the request of the officers of the army.' He was then dismissed.<sup>83</sup>

Despite his behaviour, Zafar clearly still believed that he could trust Bakht Khan, and over the following days he gave him the titles 'Farzand' [Son] and Sahib i-Alam [Lord of the World] with supreme military authority over all the rebel armies, replacing the former Commander-in-Chief, Mirza Mughal; later Zafar appointed Bakht Khan Governor General while Mirza Mughal was given the title Adjutant General, which effectively turned him from military commander into head of the administration.<sup>84</sup>

In return Bakht Khan made an energetic attempt to solve the many problems that had paralysed the rebels despite their overwhelming numerical superiority to the small British-led force shelling them from the Ridge. He also attempted to sort out the problems caused by the sepoys' looting of the city, and made arrangements for the payment of all the royal salaries. Stern instructions were given to the kotwal and his police to arrest all looters, and commands were issued that the sepoys should be removed from the bazaars and relocated in the new camp outside Delhi Gate. According to Munshi Jiwan Lal, the following days were a whirlwind of orders and innovation:

The General ordered a proclamation, by beat of drum, that all shopkeepers were to keep arms, and that no one was to leave his house unarmed. Persons having no arms were to apply to the headquarters for them and were to be given them free of charge. Any soldier caught plundering was to have his arm severed from his body. All persons having [looted] ammunition were to give it over to the magazine on pain of severe punishment … The General inspected the Magazine, and ordered the stores and material to be properly ordered … An order was issued instructing the [younger] princes that they were relieved from all further duties connected with the army … Orders were issued for the whole of the troops to parade in the morning … Three spies from the English camp were

executed … The troops were paraded from the Delhi Gate to the Ajmere Gate; the General spoke kindly to the men and comforted them … [but] warned [them] not to harass and plunder the people of the city. 85

More impressive still was the new military strategy that Bakht Khan put in place. An attempt at a flanking operation – sending a force up along the Yamuna to Alipore on 3 July – was a partial failure, after it was spotted and ambushed by the British on its return from burning their supply base in the village; but it was at least an imaginative innovation. At the same time, Bakht Khan developed a new rota system so that the British would be kept continually off balance. Their spies informed the British of the new rule: that 'not a single day should pass without a skirmish, and for this purpose the army has been divided into three parts so that at least one fights every day'.<sup>86</sup>

The increase in the tempo of the attacks had an almost immediate effect: according to Richard Barter, thanks to the 'system organised by Bakht Khan … we were scarcely able to stand …Worn out, and knowing that there would be no hope of relief, some soldiers grew desperate and dashed at the Enemy, getting killed on purpose to be rid of such an existence as soon as possible, their idea being that as it must come sooner or later, the sooner it is over the better'.<sup>87</sup>

![](_page_30_Picture_3.jpeg)

The ninth of July, exactly a week after his arrival in Delhi, was the day that Bakht Khan set for a concerted attempt to finish the British position for good.

It started brilliantly at 5 a.m., with a massive cannonade from the city followed, in pouring rain, by a rear attack by some of Bakht Khan's irregular cavalry dressed in the same white uniforms as the British irregulars. Thanks to the confusion caused by this disguise, they managed to get deep inside the British camp – the first rebel soldiers successfully to

penetrate the defences – before the alarm was sounded. They cut up some of the artillery and almost succeeded in capturing the crucial British horse guns before they were driven out.

At the same time the full force of the Bareilly army poured out of the city and made for the suburb of Kishenganj with the intention of turning the right flank of the British. The British managed to drive them back; but rather than fleeing, the sepoys lured the British away from their entrenchments and continued the fight farther down the slopes, where the British had far less cover. Lieutenant Charles Griffiths was impressed by the steely discipline with which they continued retreating in perfect order, turning at intervals and file-firing their muskets, while every now and then their guns were faced about, and round-shot and grape sent among the exposed British ranks.

The rain now descended in a steady downpour, soaking through our thin cotton clothing, and in a few minutes drenching us to the skin … Many of our men fell … It was a perfect *feu d'enfer*, and the loss on our side became so heavy that a temporary check was the result, and it was only with great trouble that the men could be urged on … The losses on this day exceeded that of any since the siege began. Out of our small force engaged, 221 men were killed and wounded.<sup>88</sup>

Elsewhere, a little to the west, Bakht Khan, supported by the jihadis, led an attack that captured the outlying British picket at the garden of Tis Hazari. It was a measure of the fragile mental state of the army – the fear, frustration and strain that the British were under – that, according to Major William Ireland, after incursion into their camp, several of the British troops

turned their rage on a number of defenceless Indian servants, who had collected for refuge near the churchyard. Several wretches were butchered, some hiding behind tombs. One woman was shot through the breast … So many sanguinary fights and executions had brutalised our men, who now regarded the life of a native as of less value than that of the meanest of animals; nor had their officers endeavoured, either by precept or example, to correct them …

Servants who behaved with astonishing fidelity were treated even by the officers with outrageous harshness. The men beat and ill-used them … Many were killed. The sick syces [grooms], grass cutters and dooly bearers, many of whom were wounded in our service, lay for months on the bare ground, exposed to the sun by day and the cold at night … The tone of conversation in the mess was wild and fierce: a general massacre of the inhabitants of Delhi, many of whom were known to wish us success, was openly proclaimed …<sup>89</sup>

The passage highlights something that is often forgotten in accounts of life on the Ridge: the fact that just over half the soldiers, and almost all the vast support staff, were not British, but Indian. It was, all in all, a very odd sort of religious war, where a Muslim emperor was pushed into rebellion against his Christian oppressors by a mutinous army of overwhelmingly Hindu sepoys, who came to him of their own free will (and initially against his) to ask for the *barakat* of a Muslim blessing and the leadership of the Mughal they regarded as their legitimate ruler.

It is even odder that one of the greatest threats to the cohesiveness and unity of the Mughal's new forces was the arrival of groups of Muslim jihadis who eventually came to make up at least half of the rebel army in Delhi; and that when the British counter-attacked against those forces they did so by raising against the Mughal a new army that consisted largely of Pathan and Punjabi Muslim irregulars. As the casualty figures on the Delhi Mutiny memorial show, no less than a third of the 'British' casualties among officers, and fully 82 per cent among other ranks, were classified as 'native'.<sup>90</sup> By the very end of the siege, by the time the last reinforcements reached the Ridge from the Punjab, the 'British' force was probably around four-fifths Indian. If the Uprising in Delhi started as a contest between the British and a largely Hindu sepoy army drawn mainly from Avadh, it ended as a fight between a mixed rebel force, at least half of which were civilian jihadis, taking on an army of British-paid Sikh and Muslim mercenaries from the North West Frontier and the Punjab.

Moreover, for all the rhetoric in letters from the Ridge about the 'British pluck' and 'native cowardice', this racist language came from a group whose own family backgrounds were anything but perfect Anglo-Saxon

exemplars of racial 'purity'; indeed, in the cases where details are available they were in fact, perhaps to their own embarrassment, splendidly multicultural. Elizabeth Wagentrieber had of course all her Skinner cousins, many of whom – including probably her own mother – were Indian Muslims. Theo and GG Metcalfe had a number of Punjabi Sikh cousins through James Metcalfe, son of Sir Thomas's elder brother, and predecessor as Delhi Resident, Sir Charles, by the lovely Sikh *bibi* he met at the court of Ranjit Singh in Lahore and, according to family tradition, married 'by Indian rites'.<sup>91</sup> As a teenager the half-Punjabi James had grown up with his first cousins in England, and was currently living in London, where Theo's younger brother Charles, later to be the translator of the Mutiny Narratives of Munshi Jiwan Lal and Muin ud-Din, used to visit him and took rather a shine to his cousin's beautiful wife, 'a jolly regular girl, and such a one as I should have no hesitation to marry when my time comes', as he wrote to GG. 'In fact to say it outright I really like her exceedingly. The very moment I saw her, I said to James, Mrs J is the very image of GG.'<sup>92</sup>

Padre Rotton was an even more striking case. For all the padre's rhetoric about the English as God's Chosen People, the padre had a whole tribe of Anglo-Indian first cousins. These included James Rotton, who could not speak English, and the twenty-two Muslim sons of his convert cousin, Felix Rotton, by various Indian wives ('complete natives in every sense of the word'), all of whom were at that moment engaged in fighting on the rebel side in Avadh, where they took an active part in besieging the British Residency in Lucknow. According to Company documents in the India Office Library, 'Mr [Felix] Rotton seems voluntarily to have remained with the Rebels till July last [i.e. July 1857], to be the father of rebels, and to labour under the strongest presumption of disloyalty.' He did nothing to help the British, 'though the descendant of a European himself, [and] all his sons capable of bearing arms were hostile to us, and he is answerable for the sons he begot'.\* 93

Even Fred Roberts, for all his letters back home full of expletives about the 'vile natives … a despicable set of cowards', had a Muslim Anglo-Indian half-brother, John Roberts, also known as Chhote Saheb, who, like the padre's cousins, was at that moment engaged in the struggle against the British in Lucknow. John 'lived entirely in the style of Indians and was a devout Muslim, who was very particular about his religious observances such as *namaz* [prayers] and *roza* [fasts]'; and he had married a Lucknavi

lady called Shahzadi Begum, granddaughter of Nawab Ramzan Ali Khan. John shared Fred's facility with the pen and was an Urdu poet of note under the pen-name 'Jan' though he was unable to read or write English. Their father, General Sir Abraham Roberts, KCB, was furious when he heard that John had sided with the rebels at the same time as his half-brother was being hailed as a hero on the Ridge, and promptly cut off his allowance. 'I hope you can get some help from the Rajah for whom you made gun carriages to go against the English,' wrote the fuming general. 'Had you gone like the others to the Resident you would have been saved, but now there is no chance of you getting anything.'<sup>94</sup>

As far as the rebels were concerned, the 9 July attack on the British was certainly the most successful yet. But expectations in both the Palace and the city had been too high, and there was still a strong sense of disappointment that there was as yet no great breakthrough, and that the British remained as firmly entrenched as ever on the Ridge.

This feeling of frustration deepened in the weeks that followed. The lack of intelligence reaching the city meant that no one among the rebels realised how successful Bakht Khan's tactics were proving: unaware of the fragility of the British position and the pressure Bakht Khan was putting on it, they could see only that the lines remained unchanged, and muttering against Bakht Khan soon set in. Mirza Mughal had strongly resented the manner in which he had his command taken from him, while the other sepoys disliked obeying a commander from a different regiment. Slowly, as the attacks failed to produce any clinching victory, Bakht Khan's prestige, and his grip on the sepoys, began to slip.

Towards the end of July, complaints against Bakht Khan began to be openly aired in the durbar. On the 29th one sepoy complained that 'many days had passed and the general had not led his forces to fight'. Bakht Khan was furious, but the Emperor remarked that what had been said was true.<sup>95</sup> A few days later, when a planned attack was called off owing to heavy rain, Zafar became angry and said, 'You will never capture the Ridge … All the

treasure you have brought me you have expended. The Royal Treasury is empty. I hear that day by day soldiers are leaving for their homes. I have no hopes of becoming victorious.'

The following day petitions arrived from 2,000 troops in Gwalior and 6,000 jihadis in Nasirabad, saying they were ready to march on Delhi if the King gave the order. But Zafar dictated the reply: 'Say there are 60,000 men in Delhi, and they have not driven the English army from the Ridge; what can your 6,000 do?' When Bakht Khan then complained that the sepoys were no longer obeying his orders, Zafar replied, 'Tell them, then, to leave the city.'<sup>96</sup> A little later Zafar added that it was intolerable that the city should still be

harassed and threatened by soldiers, who had come to the city with the avowed object of destroying the English, not their own countrymen. These soldiers are always boasting that they are going out of the safety afforded by the fortifications to destroy the English, and yet are always returning to the city. It is quite clear that the English will ultimately recapture this city, and will kill me.<sup>97</sup>

There was little surprise, then, when, at the end of July, there was yet another change in the military command. Bakht Khan was effectively removed as Commander-in-Chief, and instead the supreme authority was given over to a Court of Administration, under the presidency of Mirza Mughal, who acted in the name of his father. The court was an odd institution: a sort of elective military junta, showing the strong influence of Western republican rather than Mughal political ideas, even to the extent of using English words for the different positions in the court. According to its remarkable twelve-point constitution, there were ten members. Six of these were chosen *(muntakhab)* from the military: two each from the infantry, cavalry and artillery. The four remaining members were from the Palace.

The court met regularly and acted as a liaison committee linking the military and civil authorities.<sup>98</sup> Occasionally the court intervened effectively, such as when it criticised Mirza Khizr Sultan for making arrests and collecting taxes from the town's bankers without its authority. <sup>99</sup> But it never acted as a unified central command, and Bakht Khan always kept his distance from it: in the records that survive among the Mutiny Papers it

appears to have been very much the organ of Mirza Mughal and his military allies, from which the Bareilly brigade, still under Bakht Khan's command, remained effectively independent.

Given this, the court seems in fact to have achieved the direct opposite of what was intended for it. Rather than co-ordinating the different rebel regiments, it emphasised the existing divisions between them, polarising them even more dramatically than before into competing factions acting under their own independent warlords. Either way, the end of Bakht Khan's military system brought instant relief to the British on the Ridge. As Richard Barter noted, 'The King of Delhi in Durbar had taunted the leaders of the mutineers with their want of success; this gave rise to mutual recriminations, and refusal of some to carry out any longer the system organised by Bakht Khan. And so, when we were scarcely able to stand, the attacks ceased, as if by a dispensation of Providence, and gave our force the repose they so much needed.'<sup>100</sup>

![](_page_36_Picture_2.jpeg)

The speed of Bakht Khan's fall was exacerbated by his hard-line 'Wahhabi' views. There were suggestions that he did not 'supply the wants' of highcaste Hindus, who duly applied to the King asking whether they could be transferred to the command of Mirza Mughal.<sup>101</sup> Later, contrary to the King's express wishes, he gathered all the '*ulama* of the city and dragooned them into signing a Fatwa of Jihad, declaring it mandatory for all Muslims to arm and fight the religious war under the command of the head of the jihadis, Maulvi Sarfaraz Ali; several maulvis, including Ghalib's friend Mufti Sadruddin Azurda, afterwards said they had been forced into signing against their will, and that they had been threatened that if they refused 'their families would be destroyed and ruined'.<sup>102</sup>

Embolded by this fatwa, towards the end of July the jihadis made the most serious breach in the common front that had been so successfully maintained by both Hindus and Muslims. The feast of Bakr 'Id was approaching; to the horror of the court, who had always made huge efforts

never to allow the city to be divided on communal grounds, the jihadis went out of their way deliberately to offend Hindu feelings. Normally, across the Islamic world, Muslims celebrated Bakr 'Id [or 'Id ul-Adha] by sacrificing a goat or a sheep to commemorate the sacrifice of Abraham and God's sparing of Ismail (who in the Koran is the son who is about to be offered up, not Isaac as in the Old Testament). But as Muhammad Baqar wrote,

The Ghazees who have come from Tonk have determined to kill a cow on the open space in front of the Jama Masjid on the day of 'Id, some three days hence. They say that if the Hindus offer any opposition to this, they will kill them, and after settling accounts with the Hindus they will then attack and destroy the *Firangis*. 'For,' say they, 'we are to be martyrs for the faith and the honours of martyrdom are to be obtained just as well by killing a Hindu as by killing a *firangi*.'<sup>103</sup>

Shortly afterwards, on 19 July, some Hindu sepoys cut the throats of five Muslim butchers they accused of cow killing. A full-scale crisis, dividing the city down its central religious axis, looked imminent. This was something Zafar had always dreaded. Since Delhi was almost exactly half Hindu, he had always clearly understood that it would be impossible to rule without the consent and blessing of half his subjects; moreover, he had a Hindu mother, and had always followed enough Hindu customs to profoundly alarm the more orthodox '*ulama*. Now he rose to the occasion with an unusually decisive response. The same day as the butchers were killed, Zafar banned the butchery of cows, forbade the eating of beef and authorised for anyone found killing a cow the terrible punishment of being blown from a cannon. The police reacted immediately, even going so far as to arrest any kebab-wallah who was found grilling beef kebabs. One of these, Hafiz Abdurrahman, wrote to the court swearing that he was not a butcher and could not be held responsible for cow slaughter; moreover, he had taken up his current profession of kebab grilling only after his usual business had been ruined by the rioting of the sepoys. He was not, however, released.<sup>104</sup>

Next, Zafar issued an order that all the town's cows should be registered, with *chaukidars* and sweepers of the different *muhallas* instructed to report to the local police station all 'cow-owning Muslim households' and for each

police thana then to make out a list 'of all the cows being bred by the followers of Islam' and to send it to the Palace. This order the *thanadars* were instructed to carry out within six hours.<sup>105</sup> On the 30th the kotwal, Sa'id Mubarak Shah, was instructed to proclaim loudly throughout the town that cow killing was absolutely forbidden since it would cause 'unnecessary strife which will only strengthen the enemy'; anyone 'who even harbours the thought or acts in defiance of the government order will receive severe punishment'.<sup>106</sup>

Further orders followed, including one oddly surreal directive commanding that all the registered cows should now be given shelter in the city's central police station, the kotwali. Zafar may have been unwilling or unable to lock up the jihadis, but he could lock up the cows. This order, however, proved much more difficult to carry out. Sa'id Mubarak Shah wrote back in alarm to point out that 'if the cows of all the Muslims are called in then they would amount to something like five hundred to a thousand cows. For this purpose we need a large field or enclosure where they can be penned for a few days, but this loyal one does not know of any such place and the owners will only be suspicious and worried'. The plan was duly dropped, and instead bonds were taken from the cow owners that they would not permit the sacrifice of their cattle.<sup>107</sup>

Finally, Mufti Sadruddin Azurda was sent out to mediate with the mujahedin.<sup>108</sup> It was a clever choice of emissary, and not just because Azurda was the most respected Muslim intellectual in Delhi, 'the wisest of the wise', according to Sayyid Ahmad Khan – the one who could, thought the Delhi poet Sabir, 'kick the knowledge of Plato on the head' and bring Aristotle 'from the height of perfection to the dust of disgrace'. <sup>109</sup> Azurda was a natural diplomat: a product of the puritan school of Shah Waliullah who was none the less a poet and the friend of poets; a leading member of the Delhi '*ulama* who used to mediate successfully between the Mughals and the Residency. Moreover, Azurda was not only a close adviser and ally of Zafar, but also the teacher and former employer of Maulvi Sarfaraz Ali, whose career he had shaped until the latter left Delhi. There is no record of what passed between the two, but at the end of it, Maulvi Sarfaraz agreed to persuade the mujahedin to forgo the pleasure of slaughtering cows and eating beef on 'Id.

Thanks to all Zafar's precautions, 'Id passed peacefully on I August. The British, who were aware through their spies of the growing communal tension, and who had been eagerly hoping for a major communal riot, were disappointed. Hervey Greathed was left merely to grumble in a letter to his wife 'that it is a good satire on the Mahomedans fighting for their faith, that at this Eid, under the Mahomedan king, no one was permitted to sacrifice a cow'."<sup>110</sup>

![](_page_39_Picture_1.jpeg)

For both Zafar and Maulvi Muhammad Baqar, the incident of the cows, the jihadis and the murdered butchers seems to have been a turning point.

For two and a half months now their city had been looted and terrorised by waves of incoming sepoys and jihadis. But at least it had initially looked as if, once a period of transition was over, there might be hope of a new order and the restoration of the Mughal dynasty whose emperors both men looked upon as khalifas, the only legitimate and sacred rulers of Hindustan. But by the end of July, victory over the British seemed increasingly remote. A much more likely outcome, it now seemed, was the imminent unravelling of the central stitching that held Delhi together: the peaceful coexistence of Hindu and Muslim. This seemed to both Zafar and Baqar to be too high a price to pay. In the week following the killing of the butchers, both men, quite separately, put out feelers to the British camp, hoping to reach some sort of accommodation with the troops on the Ridge.

For Zafar and Baqar, this decision had been a long time in coming. As July progressed, Zafar had become more depressed and emotionally detached from the Uprising. His loyalties had always been to his city and his dynasty, and it was becoming increasingly clear that the interests of neither were being served by this crisis; quite to the contrary, it was now much more likely that the Uprising would lead to the destruction of Delhi and the final fall of the Mughals after more than three hundred years in power. When Sarvar ul-Mulk's uncle went to the King 'in full court dress, with a turban on his head and a belt around his waist' and asked for some troops to fight the British, Zafar replied, 'I do not possess troops to give

you. I am 80 years old and infirm. This fight is not mine. Mutinous troops are fighting. If you have a desire to fight, then go to the officers of these troops and settle it with them.'<sup>111</sup>

Unable to lean on his queen, Zinat Mahal, who had now retired to her house in the city, furious at what she saw as her husband's disastrous prorebel policies, and unable to fall back on the chamberlain, the eunuch Mahbub Ali Khan, Zafar's behaviour became so erratic that it seemed he was beginning to crack – he was after all eighty years old, and had shown some signs of senility even before the Uprising.

As the siege wore on, and the prospects grew bleaker, his reactions to events in the durbar became more petulant and selfcentred. Sometimes indeed they were eccentric to the point of madness, like those of some Indian King Lear, such as when he appointed his father-in-law to be Nawab of Oudh, a region the Mughals had not controlled since the mid-eighteenth century. <sup>112</sup> Later, he tried to persuade a disaffected sepoy general to stay in Delhi by offering him the position of Subahdar of the Deccan and Gujerat, regions that had been out of Mughal hands for even longer. <sup>113</sup> By early August, he had retreated into writing poetry, with verses that, like his moods, swung from gloom to unrealistic optimism: 'The King is employed the whole day in composing poetical pieces,' reported the spy Gauri Shankar on 7 August. 'One verse composed by him is as follows:

> O Zafar, we are going to take London shortly, It is not far.'<sup>114</sup>

When he was not writing poetry, much of his time was spent trying to get the sepoys out of his beloved gardens, many of which he had laid out himself. This he finally achieved in June, only to find a fortnight later that '200 soldiers of the 54th NI, and a doctor with his family have located themselves there'. As he wrote in exasperation to Mirza Mughal, 'The Royal cortege frequently condescends to go in that direction, and much inconvenience is felt on such occasions. You our son are therefore directed to speak to the Officers of the Court on this matter, and to have these soldiers and the native doctor removed.'<sup>115</sup>

At other times Zafar just seemed to wish to escape. His threat to leave Delhi and to go on haj, and there to live a life of prayer, was probably

initially just a lever to try to bring unity to the Uprising, and to pressurise the sepoys to obey him and cease plundering his city. But by July it did seem to reflect a profound wish simply to escape the horror of his position; he had had enough of watching impotently as everything he had planned and worked for – the cultured and civilised oasis he had built, the survival of the dynasty he tried all his life to preserve – was torn apart and destroyed in front of his eyes.

The degree to which Zafar was trapped is revealed in one of the most pathetic documents produced at his trial: a letter to his minor feudatory, Abd ur-Rahman Khan, the Nawab of the small bazaar town of Jhajjar – the same man who had refused to shelter Theo – begging the Nawab to come and rescue him. He addressed the Nawab – a foppish aesthete who had never seen a war in his life – as the 'Tiger in Battle' and explained

that owing to the occurrence of many unpleasant circumstances, and being unable, in consequence of our advanced age and debility of body, to attend to the affairs of government and country, we now have no desire left but to engage in such good works as are approvable to God and mankind, to spend the remainder of our life in service and worship of God.

He went on to spell out his wholly impractical plan: first to move 'with all the members of the exalted house Taimur' and 'all the property and chattels of the whole of the members of the royal family' to the Sufi shrine of Khwaja Qutb in Mehrauli and then, having gathered everything that was needed for the journey, to proceed through war-torn India to 'the Holy Tabernacles' of Mecca and Medina. So he begged the Nawab of Jhajjar, 'our slave, to come quickly to our royal presence, with those of your retainers in whom you have fullest confidence … to protect our divine person till our departure for the holy house of God [Mecca]. In acting thus you will secure our entire divine approval and pleasure, and your fame will likewise spread throughout mankind'. There was, however, a small logistical difficulty: 'There are no carriages whatever [procurable] here,' wrote Zafar. 'Be sure, therefore, to bring with you 400 or 500 carts, and 500 or 600 camels.'<sup>116</sup>

The Nawab, who was determined to sit on the fence and commit himself to neither side, made his apologies: he was very sorry, he wrote, but such

was the instability of the times that he was unable to come to the assistance of the Shadow of God. It was soon after this, according to one British spy, that Zafar recited the following couplet after the sepoy officers had left him one evening:

> The skies have fallen down on us, I can no longer rest or sleep. Only my final departure is now certain, Whether it comes in the morning, or night.<sup>117</sup>

Zahir Dehlavi, who attended on Zafar as a page throughout the siege, saw him sink lower and lower as July gave way to August, until he reached a state approaching helpless despair. 'He was always in a sad and melancholy mood,' Zahir wrote long afterwards,

and at all times his eyes were full of tears. In the evenings he used to go in and sit in his oratory, the *Tasbih Khana*, by himself and would curse the rebels. We were instructed to be present by turns, and one night while I was on duty, we heard the guard asking us all to be alert, and we all put on our turbans and got ready. When the King appeared, we all stood up and greeted him. The King sat in the *Tasbih Khana* on his low throne, leaning back against a bolster. Then he addressed us saying, 'do you realize the full consequences of what is happening?' Shahzada Hamid Khan replied, 'After one hundred and fifty years your Majesty's prestige has been restored, and the lost Empire of the Mughals has returned.'

The King shook his head. 'My children,' he said, 'you do not understand. Listen: I did nothing to attract this destruction. I did not have treasures and riches, nor land nor Empire. I was always a beggar, a Sufi sitting in a corner in search of God, with a few people around me, eating my daily bread. But now the great fire that was lit in Meerut has, by the will of the Lord, blown over to Delhi, and it has set this great city alight. Now it seems I and my line are destined to be ruined. The name of the great Timurid [Mughal] Emperors is still alive, but soon that name will be completely destroyed and forgotten. These faithless people [the sepoys] who have rebelled against their masters, and have come

here for shelter, will all be gone before long. When these people have been unfaithful to their own leaders what can I expect of them? They have come to ruin my house, and once they have ruined it they will flee. Then the English will cut off my head, and those of my children, and they will display them on top of the Fort. They will not spare any one of you, and if any of you are saved, then remember what I am telling you: even when you will take a morsel of bread in your mouth it will be seized and flung far off from you, and the noblemen of Hindustan will be treated like base villagers.<sup>118</sup>

For Zafar, making contact with the British, and exploring the possibility of coming to terms, was not difficult; in fact his wife and prime minister were already in indirect communication with the Ridge through Hodson's intelligence chief, Maulvi Rajab Ali. Baqar probably chose the same route, and was asked to collate a newsletter to be sent up to the intelligence department in the British camp. A contemporary translation, presumably made at the time on the Ridge, of what appears to be Baqar's first report survives in the archives of the Delhi Commissioner's Office and gives an indication of why such an outspokenly enthusiastic rebel had become so thoroughly disillusioned in less than three months. 'Since the Hindoo sepoys killed the five butchers for killing cows there have been great dissensions between the Hindus and Mahomedans in the rebel forces,' he wrote.

We, the respectable portion of the inhabitants are reduced to the last extremity by the violence of the sepoys, and have no hope of escaping with our lives. The General Bakht Khan's spies dog me wherever I go. There are sentries over the house of Mufti Sadruddin Khan [Azurda] and all exit and entrances prohibited. Through Zinat Mahal I suggested to the King to open the gates and invite the English to come and seize the city, telling him that if he could destroy the mutineers it would be of great advantage to himself and his children. The King approved my advice and promised to do it. But Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, on account of the difference of our faith has prevented my counsels being carried out. The Hakim is a Sunni, the writer of this a Shia.<sup>119</sup>

Neither man was to benefit from these belated attempts to make terms. Although both General Wilson on the Ridge and Lawrence in Lahore recommended to Calcutta that Zafar's overtures should at least be explored, Canning was adamant that no negotiations of any sort should take place, and that on no account should Zafar be allowed to think that he would be permitted to keep his old title or position once the rebellion was crushed.<sup>120</sup> The Mughal court was therefore left in limbo, unable to free itself from association with an uprising from which it felt increasingly alienated, and the defeat of which was now increasingly likely. Meanwhile Muhammad Baqar was kept on by Hodson as a spy, but failed to secure any sort of guarantee that his betrayal of the cause would save his life when the city fell.

![](_page_44_Picture_1.jpeg)

By the end of July there were clear signs that the military balance was now swinging irreversibly in favour of the British. Although the troops on the Ridge were still vastly outnumbered by those in the city, the attacks were growing fewer and less spirited every day, while dissension was increasing among the rebel leadership. 'The tide is beginning to turn,' wrote Greathed in a letter to his wife on 29 July, 'and the waves already beat with less force against the rock of our defence.'<sup>121</sup>

In the British camp thoughts now began to turn to ideas of revenge: the mass murder of the people of Delhi was openly and enthusiastically discussed, as was the levelling of the city. This vengefulness was stoked by the British press, which had just heard about the worst war crime against British civilians in the entire Uprising: the massacre of the 73 women and 124 children at the Bibigarh in Kanpur. One of the most bloodthirsty was George Wagentrieber, who, after his escape from Delhi, had made his way with his wife and family to Lahore, from where he now edited a reborn *Delhi Gazette* known as the *Delhi Gazette Extra*, which aimed at being a newsletter and cheerleader for the surviving members of the British community of Delhi. In issue after issue Wagentrieber called hysterically for the complete destruction of Delhi and the 'annihilation of the demons

who have so polluted its walls and blackened the pages of history with their hellish crimes'.<sup>122</sup>

The storm of revolutionary atrocity and fiendish crime have swept over the British occupants of Bengal, leaving behind it a wreck of horror and desolation, only equalled by the ingratitude and crime displayed by the Hell hounds who have originated and executed thus far their diabolical scheme of raising once again the standard of the lascivious Prophet, in opposition to the new dispensation offered to mankind, in the man Christ Jesus, the son of God …

Hindoo and Moslem have proclaimed their caste and their religion to the world in a mass of fiendish cruelty that stands as unparalleled in the world's history. The punishment about to be inflicted will likewise be equivalent: Justice is Mercy – 'blood for blood' will be the watchword throughout the storm pending over the doomed city; the British soldier must hurry: the Avenging Angel uses you in the massacre that awaits your advance on Delhi.

Let us look a little beyond, and let us view Delhi, as Delhi must shortly be, re-occupied by the British Force, the General Commanding sitting in the Mogul's Palace, and a hempen necklace around the King's throat as a substitute for his crown, and his life sacrificed to British justice. What next? Our reply is this: Let Delhi sink into silence; still, still as the silence of the dead within its walls … whilst unceasing justice rolls on its course, encircling in its grasp and sacrificing at its shrine, the life of every native mixed up in this terrible storm.<sup>123</sup>

That massacre of the inhabitants of Delhi, commanded and justified in the eyes of Victorian Evangelicals by their reading of the Christian scriptures, drew one step nearer on 5 August, when the news arrived on the Ridge that substantial reinforcements were finally on their way. In order to manage this feat, John Lawrence had had to strip the Punjab of almost all British troops, thus taking a colossal gamble that the Punjab would remain quiet. But a siege train one mile long loaded with heavy artillery had been gathered in Ferozepur and was now on the move, lumbering down the

Grand Trunk Road, while the much faster Moveable Column had reached Ambala and was just days away from relieving the Field Force.

Better still for the morale of the British troops on the Ridge, and especially for those who were looking forward to a bloody reckoning within the walls of Delhi, was the news, as the Moveable Column approached, that John Nicholson was now at its head.
