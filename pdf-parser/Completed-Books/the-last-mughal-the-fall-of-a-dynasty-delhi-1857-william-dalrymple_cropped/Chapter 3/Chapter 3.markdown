## **1 A CHESSBOARD KING**

The marriage procession of Prince Jawan Bakht left the Lahore Gate of the Red Fort at 2 a.m. on the hot summer night of 2 April 1852.

With a salute from the cannon stationed on the ramparts, and an arc of fireworks and rockets fired aloft from the illuminated turrets of the Fort, the two gates opposite the great thoroughfare of Chandni Chowk swung open.

The first to emerge were the *chobdars* or mace-bearers. The people of Delhi have never much liked being restrained by barriers and were in the habit of breaking through the bamboo railings hung with lamps that illuminated the processional route. It was the job of the *chobdars* to clear a way through the excitable crowd, before the imperial elephants – always a little unpredictable in the presence of fireworks – appeared lumbering through the gates.

Two ministers of state on horseback began the procession proper. Shell ornaments were plaited into the horses' manes, and bells strung around their necks and fetlocks, and as they rode out, the ministers were attended by servants with punkahs (fans). Then came a troop of Mughal infantry, with polished black shields and curved swords, long lances and fluttering pennons of green and gold.

The first six of the imperial elephants followed, caparisoned with gold and saffron headcloths embroidered with the Emperor's coat of arms. From the howdahs,\* officials held aloft the dynastic insignia that had been used by the Mughals since their arrival in India more than three centuries earlier: from one, the face of a rayed sun; from another, two golden fish suspended at each end of a golden bow; from the third, the head of a lion-like beast; from the fourth, a golden Hand of Fatima; from the fifth, a horse's head; and from the last, a *chatri* or imperial umbrella. All were made of gold and were raised on gilt staffs from which trailed silken streamers.

There then emerged in turn a party of red-tunicked Palace servants carrying covered trays of food and gifts for the bride's family; a squadron of camels, with drums beating and guns firing in the air; a small regiment of British sepoys led by Captain Douglas, Commandant of the Palace Guards, all in tight-fitting busbees and blue-and-saffron uniforms, and escorting two light cannon; a troop of Skinner's Horse in their yellow tunics and scarlet sashes, topped by armoured breastplates and medieval-looking helmets; a group of bullock-drawn wagons on which sat several bands of Mughal kettle drummers, *shanai* players, trumpeters and cymbal clashers; and a European brougham carriage, painted kingfisher blue, containing a party of senior princes, their gilt brocade flashing in the light of the exploding fireworks.

After each group came parties of torchbearers, holding their flames aloft, interspersed with men holding candles in glass bell jars. There were also gangs of water carriers emptying their skins on to the road in an attempt to settle the billowing summer dust kicked up by the procession.

After the brougham there came a second, smaller group of younger princes, this time riding on horseback; and among them, in the very centre, rode the groom. Mirza Jawan Bakht was only eleven years old, a young bridegroom even in a society that tended to marry its offspring early in adolesence. Immediately behind the Prince swayed the elephant on which rode the Emperor himself, sitting in his golden howdah and decked out, despite the sweltering night heat, in his state robes and jewels, and attended by his personal bearer holding a peacock fan. The rest of the court followed behind on foot, a great snaking queue stretching back through Chatta Chowk, the Fort bazaar, to the Naqqar Khana Darwaza, or the Gate of the Drum House, in the very centre of the Fort.<sup>1</sup>

Not long before this, the Emperor and Jawan Bakht had both sat for the Austrian artist, August Schoefft.<sup>2</sup> The portrait of Zafar depicts a dignified, reserved and rather beautiful old man with a fine aquiline nose and a carefully trimmed beard. Despite his height and surprisingly broad and muscular build, there is a profound gentleness and sensitivity in his large brown watery eyes with their unusually long lashes. As a teenage prince, Zafar had always appeared in his portraits as a slightly awkward and uncertain figure, plump, visibly ill at ease and thinly bearded. But as youth gave way to middle age he had grown into his looks, and in old age – unusually – looked finer than ever. Now in his mid-seventies, his cheeks were sallow, his nose more pronounced and his bearing more regal. Yet as the elderly monarch kneels, wearily fingering his beads, there remains in the expression of his dark eyes something unmistakably melancholic; in the set of his full lips there is still that air of sad, patient resignation visible in the earlier pictures. Schoefft shows Zafar a little swamped under the brocade cloth of gold which adorns him, somewhat weighed down by the huge blood-coloured rubies and the strings of vast pearls, each the size of a partridge egg, which seem to hang so heavily around his neck. It is a portrait of a man imprisoned by the trappings of his office.

By contrast, the young Jawan Bakht, the Emperor's favourite son, seems to relish all the pearls and gems, the jewelled daggers and inlaid swords with which he is bedecked with a lavishness almost equal to that of his father. His expression is different too: knowingly handsome, and oddly cocky and confident for a boy of eleven. He is as strikingly sure of himself as his father appears wearily uncertain.<sup>3</sup>

One person missing from both the portraits and the wedding procession was the woman who had done more than anything else to bring the marriage about. For months, Zafar's favourite wife, Zinat Mahal, had been preparing for this day. In Mughal tradition, women did not accompany the *barat* taking the groom to his marriage – not even mothers and queens; but every detail of the procession had been planned by her. For Mirza Jawan Bakht was Zinat Mahal's only son, and her one ambition, to which she held consistently throughout her life, was to see Jawan Bakht, Zafar's fifteenth son, placed on the throne at the death of his father.

The exceptionally lavish wedding she had planned was intended by her to raise the profile of the Prince, and also to consolidate her own place in the dynasty: Jawan Bakht's bride, the Nawab Shah Zamani Begum,\* who

was probably no more than ten years old at the time of the wedding, was Zinat's niece, and her father, Walidad Khan of Malagarh, an important ally of the Queen. While so young a couple would not be expected to consummate their marriage for a year or two, or even to live together, political considerations meant that the marriage should go ahead immediately, without having to wait for the couple to reach puberty.

As conceived by Zinat, the wedding of Mirza Jawan Bakht was of a scale unparalleled in Delhi in living memory, eclipsing the weddings of all Jawan Bakht's elder brothers. Sixty years later, the young courtier Zahir Dehlavi, whose job it was to oversee the care of the *Mahi Maraatib* or Fish Standard,† still remembered the aroma of the trays of food from the royal kitchens that had been sent out to every Palace official, and the spectacular entertainments that preceded the main celebration: 'such beauty and magnificence had never been seen before', he wrote many years later, in exile in Hyderabad. 'At least not in my lifetime. It was a celebration I shall never forget.'<sup>4</sup>

The festivities had begun three days before the marriage with a procession from the house of Walidad Khan to the Palace, bearing the principal wedding gifts, followed by fireworks: 'a brilliant train of elephants, camels, horses and conveyances of every denomination', according to the *Delhi Gazette.<sup>5</sup>* This led on to the ceremony of the mehndi, when the hands of the couple and their guests, including all the women of the Palace, were decorated with henna; the celebrations would continue for a further seven days beyond the night of the wedding ceremony.

On the evening of the great procession, at the beginning of the night vigil known as the *ratjaga*, Zafar had bestowed on Jawan Bakht a wedding veil made of strings of pearls known as a *sehra*, and simultaneous parties of escalating grandeur had been arranged for the different ranks of the Palace, each with their own musicians and troupes of dancing girls. Selected townspeople were in one courtyard, Palace children and students in another, senior officials in a third, and the princes in a fourth.<sup>6</sup>

Since Zafar's financial resources rarely matched his spending, let alone that of his wife, much of the initial work for the wedding had involved arranging loans from Delhi moneylenders, who knew from experience what the chances were of seeing their cash again. Since December, the British Resident's diary of court proceedings had been full of Zinat's attempts to

procure the large amounts needed, something she achieved in the end with the aid of the notoriously ruthless Chief Eunuch of the Palace, Mahbub Ali Khan.<sup>7</sup> The Palace was repaired, spring-cleaned and superbly decorated with lamps and chandeliers.<sup>8</sup> Getting sufficiently magnificent fireworks was another major concern, with pyrotechnicians from across Hindustan summoned to the Palace throughout January and February to demonstrate their skills.<sup>9</sup>

The rockets, squibs and Roman candles were still exploding around the great red sandstone curtain walls of the Fort as the wedding procession slowly proceeded westwards down the top of Chandni Chowk, with its trees and central canal glittering in the light of the torches. It snaked onwards, past the gardens of Begum Sumru's haveli, recently taken over by the new Delhi Bank, and through the Dariba – now in the light of ten thousand candles and lanterns haloed in dust – before veering left and heading under the latticed windows of the courtesans' *kothis* (town houses) lining the Kucha Bulaqi Begum.

On the procession passed, turning again under the moonlit white marble domes of the Jama Masjid. It then looped down the Khas Bazaar, before skirting the much smaller but beautifully gilt and illuminated domes of the Suneheri Masjid, and on through the Faiz Bazaar into Daryaganj. Here lay the city's great aristocratic palaces, such as the famous *kothi* of the Nawab of Jhajjar, which, according to Bishop Heber, the Anglican Primate of Calcutta, 'far exceed in grandeur anything seen in Moscow'. Among them lay the procession's destination, the haveli of Walidad Khan.<sup>10</sup>

On the way, as the Palace diary puts it, 'His Majesty's officers presented their *nazrs* [ceremonial gifts] as the procession passed their several dwellings, while HM inspected the illuminations on the road.'<sup>11</sup> The conspicuously wealthy streets through which the procession passed were still very much a Mughal creation. In 1852, despite 150 years of decline and political reversals, Delhi was once again the largest pre-colonial city in India – a position it had recently regained from Lucknow – and as the *Dar ul-Mulk*, the seat of the Mughal, was the epitome of an elegant Mughal metropolis: 'In this beautiful city', wrote the poet Mir, 'the streets are not mere streets, they are like the album of a painter.'<sup>12</sup> A similar idea was conveyed by another Delhi writer of the period, who compared the waters of the canals of Delhi's gardens to the burnished border on an illuminated

manuscript page: 'its waters, like mercury, a *jadval* [margin] of pure silver running over a page of stone'.<sup>13</sup>

At the same time as the ruling houses of Murshidabad and Lucknow were experimenting with Western fashions and Western classical architecture, Delhi remained firmly, and proudly, a centre of Mughal style. There was no question of Zafar turning up in durbar (court) dressed as a British admiral or even a vicar of the Church of England, as had been heard of in the Nawab's court in Lucknow. Nor was there much trace of Western architectural influence in the buildings erected by the later Mughal emperors: Zafar's new gateway at his summer palace, Zafar Mahal, and his delicate floating garden pavilion in Mehtab Bagh, the scented night garden of the Red Fort, were both built in the full Mughal style of Shah Jahan.

What was true of the court was true of the city: with the single exception of the Delhi Bank – formerly the great Palladian Palace of the Begum Sumru – the buildings that the marriage procession passed showed little experimentation with Western classical pediments or square Georgian windows, though such attempts at synthesis had long been common in Lucknow, and in Jaipur. In 1852, British additions within the walls of Delhi were limited to a domed church, a classical Residency building recently converted into the Delhi College, and a strongly fortified magazine, all of which stood to the north of the Fort and out of sight of the path of the procession. Moreover, there were still relatively few Europeans in Delhi – probably well under a hundred within the walls: as the poet and literary critic Azad later put it, 'those were the days when if a European was seen in Delhi, people considered him an extraordinary sample of God's handiwork, and pointed him out to each other: "Look, there goes a European!"'<sup>14</sup>

Others, it was true, took a less charitable view. So prevalent was the belief among Delhiwallahs that Englishmen were the product of an illicit union between apes and the women of Sri Lanka (or alternatively between 'apes and hogs') that the city's leading theologian, Shah Abdul Aziz, had to issue a fatwa expressing his opinion that such a view had no basis in the Koran or the Hadiths, and that however oddly *the firangis* might behave, they were none the less Christians and thus People of the Book. <sup>15</sup> As long as wine and pork were not served, it was therefore perfectly permissible to mix with them (if one should for any strange reason wish to do so) and even, on occasion, to share their food.\*

Partly as a result of this lack of regular contact with Europeans, Delhi remained a profoundly self-confident place, quite at ease with its own brilliance and the superiority of its *tahzib*, its cultured and polished urbanity. It was a city that had yet to suffer the collapse of self-belief that inevitably comes with the onset of open and unbridled colonialism. Instead, Delhi was still in many ways a bubble of conservative Mughal traditionalism in an already fast-changing India. When someone in Shahjahanabad wished to praise another citizen of the city, he would still reach for the ancient yardsticks of medieval Islamic rhetoric, cloaked in time-worn poetic tropes: the women of Delhi were as tall and slender as cypresses; the Delhi men as generous as Feridun, as learned as Plato, as wise as Solomon; their physicans were as skilled as Galen. One man who was quite clear about the virtues of his home city and its inhabitants was the young Sayyid Ahmad Khan:\* 'The water of Delhi is sweet to the taste, the air is excellent, and there are hardly any diseases,' he wrote.

By God's grace the inhabitants are fair and good looking, and in their youth uniquely attractive. Nobody from any other city can measure up to them …In particular the men of the city are interested in learning and in cultivating the arts, spending their days and nights reading and writing. If each of their traits were recounted it would amount to a treatise on good conduct."<sup>16</sup>

Rather like modern New Yorkers, Delhiwallahs of the early nineteenth century blithely took as little interest as possible in the world beyond their own familiar and beloved streets, and had to struggle to imagine anyone ever wishing to live anywhere else: as the poet Zauq put it: *'Kaun jaye Zauq par Dilli ki galian chhor kar'* (How could anyone, O Zauq, forsake Delhi and its lanes?) He was speaking in hyperbole; but behind such writing lay a real and palpable pride in a great and civilised city whose reputation as a centre of learning, culture and spirituality had rarely been higher, even as its political fortunes had waned.

If there was one thing in which the town was most confident, it was in the beauty and elegance of its language. After all, Urdu was born in Delhi:† it was a language the poet and literary historian Azad described as 'an orphan found wandering in the bazaars of Shahjahanabad'.<sup>17</sup> According to Maulvi Abd ul-Haq, 'Anyone who has not lived in Delhi could never be

considered a real connoisseur of Urdu. It is as if the steps of the Jama Masjid are a school of fine language.' There was no other city like this. In Delhi poetry 'was discussed in every house', for 'the Emperor himself was a poet and a connoisseur of poetry' and 'the language of the exalted fort was the essence of refinement'.<sup>18</sup>

This intoxication with the elegance of Delhi's language was common to both men and women – there was a special dialect of Delhi Urdu used only in the women's quarters – and perhaps more surprisingly to all classes. Poetry in particular was an obsession not just of the elite but also, to a remarkable extent, of the ordinary people. *The Garden of Poetry*, a collection of Urdu verse published two years before Mirza Jawan Bakht's wedding, contains no fewer than 540 poets from Delhi, who range from the Emperor and fifty members of his family to a poor water seller in Chandni Chowk, a merchant in Punjabi Katra, 'Farasu', an elderly German Jewish mercenary – one of a surprising number of Europeans in Delhi who had taken to Mughal culture – a young wrestler, a courtesan and a barber. <sup>19</sup> At least fiftythree of these Urdu poets have clearly Hindu names.

So although Walidad Khan had laid on the best dancers in Delhi for the marriage ceremony that night, what was remembered longest and discussed most eagerly was not so much the festivities or the feasting or the fireworks so much as the marriage odes recited by the poet laureate, Zauq, and his rival Mirza Nausha, now more widely known by his pen-name, Ghalib.

To the eye of an outsider such as the newly appointed Commandant of the Palace Guards, Captain Douglas, who accompanied the procession as far as the haveli of Walidad Khan, the wedding seemed both visually stunning and a happy and harmonious occasion. Indeed, according to the account in the Palace diary the only untoward incident in the whole ceremony was on the return journey to the Fort at 10 a.m. the following morning.

Walidad Khan had just presented his guests with the bride's marriage portion – '80 trays of clothing, 2 trays of jewellery, a golden bedstead and

canopy, vessels of silver, an elephant and horses with embroidered trappings and two riding camels' – and Zafar had just set out back to the Palace with the bride and bridegroom, when 'a baker threw two or three biscuits at the elephant on which Mirza Jawan Bakht was riding'. The elephant shied and the offending baker was taken off to the city jail.<sup>20</sup>

Nevertheless, the appearance of confidence and harmony was largely deceptive. As in so many family weddings, for all the outward show of prosperity and family unity, severe tensions lurked just beneath the surface. The very emphasis that Zafar and Zinat put on the procession was in itself significant. Certainly, the Mughals had always regarded processions as important public statements of their authority. Two hundred years earlier, the French traveller and writer François Bernier had described the magnificent ostentation of the procession which took Raushanara Begum, the daughter of Shah Jahan, on her summer outing to Kashmir in the late 1640s: 'You can conceive of nothing more imposing or grand,' he wrote in his memoirs, 'and if I had not regarded this display of magnificence with a sort of philosophical indifference, I should have been apt to be carried away by such flights of imagination as inspire most Indian poets.'<sup>21</sup> Since then, however, the Mughals had long since lost control of Kashmir; indeed, it had been well over a century since the Mughals had been able to process anywhere outside the environs of Delhi. As the famous doggerel went,

> The Kingdom of Shah Alam, Runs from Delhi to Palam.\*

In the Palace itself, the greatest treasures of the Red Fort had already been removed by the Persian invader Nadir Shah in 1739. Half a century later, in the summer of 1788, when Zafar was a boy of thirteen, the marauder Ghulam Qadir had taken the city, personally blinded Zafar's grandfather, Shah Alam II, and made Zafar's father, the future Emperor Akbar Shah II, dance for his pleasure; he then threw vinegar in the wounds by carting off Shah Alam's fabulous library, most of which he then sold to the Nawab of Avadh, much to the Emperor's fury. <sup>22</sup> A blind emperor was left ruling from a ruined palace: 'only a chessboard king', as Azad put it.<sup>23</sup>

After the death of Shah Alam II, the authority of the Mughals had contracted further, so that Zafar did not control even as far as Palam;

instead his real authority existed only within the walls of the Red Fort, as if he were an Indian pope within his own Vatican City. Even there it was in some ways circumscribed. For the British Resident,\* Sir Thomas Metcalfe, kept a friendly but none the less firm eye on Zafar's daily life and frequently forbade him from exercising rights that the Emperor regarded as sacrosanct.

No nobleman from outside Delhi, for example, could enter the Red Fort without Metcalfe's permission.<sup>24</sup> To enforce his right to rent from his own lands, Zafar had to make an application to the British courts.<sup>25</sup> He could not present gems from the crown jewels even to his own family members without first informing the Resident, and was occasionally, humiliatingly, made to ask for the return of unauthorised gifts if the agent came to hear about them.<sup>26</sup> Zafar could not gift *khilats* (robes of honour, symbols of overlordship) on noblemen from outside the Delhi territories without Metcalfe's say-so: when on the day after Jawan Bakht's wedding Raja Gulab Singh of Kollesur paid a visit to the court, presenting a *nazr* (or offering of fealty) of 'a horse and 7 gold mohurs', in return for which Zafar gave him a *khilat*, Metcalfe promptly made the Raja return it: in the eyes of the Resident, the Raja was a British subject, and had no business publicly offering his fealty to a foreign ruler. 27

How far Zafar felt the humiliation of this is evident in his verse, into which he learned to sublimate his feelings of profound frustration and imprisonment. His ghazals are full of the imagery of the caged bird, of the bulbul longing for the garden visible through the bars of his prison:

> I want to shatter the bars of my cage, With the flutterings of my wings.

But like a caged bird in a painting, There is no possibility of being free.

Morning breeze, tell the garden That Spring and Autumn for me are alike.

How should I know, When one comes, and the other goes?<sup>28</sup> Elsewhere, he expressed the same thought more explicitly:

Whoever enters this gloomy palace, Remains a prisoner for life in European captivity. 29

The degree of loss of control experienced by Zafar was something quite new. When the British first came to Delhi in 1803, defeating the Maratha confederacy, who were then the masters of much of Hindustan, they posed as Shah Alam's protectors and saviours:\* 'Notwithstanding His Majesty's total deprivation of real power, dominion, and authority,' wrote the Governor General, Lord Wellesley, 'almost every state and every class of people in India continue to acknowledge his nominal sovereignty. The current coin of every established power is struck in the name of Shah Alam …' <sup>30</sup>

He did not add, though it was true, that this included the rupees of the East India Company itself; moreover, the Company's seal also directly acknowledged its position as the Mughal's legal vassal, and was inscribed to that end: 'Fidvi Shah Alam' (Shah Alam's devoted dependant). Wellesley wrote that he 'recoiled from the thought of it being suspected in England' that he wished to 'place the East India Company, substantially or vicariously, on the throne of the Moghuls', and Lord Lake was instructed to offer his 'loyalty …and every demonstration of reverence, respect and attention' to the aged monarch. The new Resident also received strict instructions that he too was to use all the forms 'considered to be due to the Emperors of Hindustan'.<sup>31</sup>

The honeymoon did not last long. The man who began the erosion of the Mughal's status was Thomas Metcalfe's cold elder brother, Sir Charles, who preceded him as Resident. 'I have renounced my former allegiance to the house of Timur,' he announced in a letter of 1832, before persuading the Governor General unilaterally to declare an end to the old tradition of giving the Emperor the ceremonial gift or *nazr* – which represented a public confirmation of the status of the British as liegemen of the Emperor. Charles Metcalfe accepted that the British were technically still the feudal inferior of the Mughal, but was determined that given the reality of British power and Mughal weakness, this must no longer be acknowledged in public: 'We have on the whole behaved generously to the King from the

first,' he wrote to the Governor General, 'and I never found him unreasonable or assuming.' But, he continued, if the Emperor refused to accept the new realities, 'I think it is our best policy in future to let him sink into insignificance instead of upholding his dignity as we have done.'<sup>32</sup>

The following year the Emperor's name was removed from East India Company rupees, and when Lord Auckland visited Delhi he did not even bother to pay a courtesy call on the Emperor Akbar Shah II. By 1850 his successor, Lord Dalhousie, was banning any British subject from accepting titles from the Mughal: 'covering the English with the Mughal ceremonial mantle' was dismissed as 'a solemn farce'.<sup>33</sup> It was a very different approach from that promised by Lord Wellesley, and amounted to an attempt by the British to try to demote their feudal lord to the status of a subject nobleman. Henceforth, more and more of the Mughal's rights and privileges were stripped away, until by 1852 Zafar was left with nothing but his palace and the lingering reputation of his dynasty.

But despite everything Zafar was still allowed his processions. Deprived of most other ways of expressing his increasingly in- tangible sovereignty, he took full advantage of the right, and the miniatures of Zafar's reign contain an almost touching number of scrolls showing processions: trips to Sufi shrines, the annual exodus to the summer palace in Mehrauli, journeys to celebrate the festival of 'Id at the old Id Gah, and expeditions to watch the Flowersellers' Fair, the *Phulwalon ki Sair*, at the ancient Jog Maya temple and the Sufi shrine of Qutb Sahib.

Seen from this point of view, the spectacular marriage procession of Jawan Bakht was less a symbol of strength than the last desperate fling of a terminally ill dynasty.

Understandably, the surviving official accounts of the wedding do not dwell on the various squabbles that we know erupted in the course of the night.

The least surprising of the spats that took place was the one between the two great court poets, Ghalib and Zauq. Almost everything about the two

men's styles and backgrounds contained possibilities for disagreement. Zauq wrote verse of startling simplicity; while Ghalib's verse was notoriously complex.\* Zauq was from a humble background – his father had been a common footsoldier; but it was he, not the self-consciously aristocratic Ghalib, who had been made Zafar's *ustad* † in poetry, and so Poet Laureate of Mughal Delhi.

Moreover, while Zauq led a quiet and simple life, composing verse from dusk until dawn, rarely straying from the tiny courtyard where he worked, Ghalib was very proud of his reputation as a rake. Only five years before the wedding, Ghalib had been imprisoned for gambling, and subsequently wore the affair – deeply embarrassing at the time – as a badge of honour. When someone once praised the poetry of the pious Sheikh Sahbai in his presence, Ghalib shot back, 'How can Sahbai be a poet? He has never tasted wine, nor has he ever gambled; he has not been beaten with slippers by lovers, nor has he once seen the inside of a jail.'<sup>34</sup> Elsewhere in his letters he makes great play of his reputation as a ladies' man. To one close friend whose mistress had just died and who had written to Ghalib from the depths of misery, he replied:

Mirza Sahib, I don't like the way you are going on. In the days of my lusty youth a man of perfect wisdom counselled me, 'Abstinence I do not approve: dissoluteness I do not forbid. Eat drink and be merry. But remember that the wise fly settles on the sugar and not on the honey.' Well I have always acted on his counsel. You cannot mourn another's death, unless you live yourself …Give thanks to God for your freedom, and do not grieve …When I think of paradise and consider how if my sins are forgiven me and I am installed in a palace with a houri, to live forever in the worthy woman's company, I am filled with dismay and fear …How wearisome to find her there – a greater burden than a man could bear. The same old palace, all of emerald made; the same fruit tree to cast its shade. And – God preserve her from all harm – the same old houri on my arm. Come to your sense, brother, and take another.

> Take a new woman each returning spring For last year's almanac is a useless thing.<sup>35</sup>

The squabble at the wedding was over a single verse in Ghalib's *sehra* (or wedding oration36) where he appeared – characteristically – to suggest that no one in the gathering could write a couplet as well as he. Most critics today would argue that it was a well-justified boast, but at the time it was taken to be a slight not just to Zauq, but also to Zafar, who was of course a considerable poet himself, and who had expressed his belief in the superiority of Zauq's talents when he appointed the latter to correct his own verses. Zafar quickly made his views apparent, presenting to Zauq a *khilat* and the honorary position of Superintendent of the Palace Gardens, while ostentatiously neglecting to provide an honour of any sort for Ghalib.<sup>37</sup> Zafar also encouraged Zauq to reply to Ghalib's unprovoked sally. The fine *sehra* that the Poet Laureate came up with ended with a couplet tossing the challenge back to Ghalib:

> The person who claims poetic skills, Recite this to him and say, 'Look – this is how a poet Weaves a real wedding veil.'

According to the account of Azad, who was admittedly a pupil and adoring partisan of Zauq's: 'Singers were in attendance and the verse was at once given to them. By evening it had spread through every street and lane of the city, and the next day it was published in the newspapers.'<sup>38</sup>

This particular round of the feud between the two poets went to Zauq.

![](_page_13_Picture_4.jpeg)

One of the principal trials in Zafar's old age appears to have been the strains that existed between his different queens and concubines, and the degree to which they all seem to have been perennially conducting intrigues with younger men. These were serious tensions which formed a strong undercurrent to the wedding celebrations of 1852.

Fifteen years earlier, at the time of Zafar's accession to the throne in 1837, his chief wife had been Taj Mahal Begum, the beautiful daughter of a humble court musician, and it was she who presided over the celebrations that accompanied his accession ceremonies.39It was not, however, a position she was able to retain for long. Only three years later the relatively aristocratic nineteen-year-old Zinat Mahal was presented to Zafar; he was sixty-four. Within a few months she had married him, effectively toppling Taj from her position as head of the harem.

Thereafter Zinat Mahal managed to retain her position as Zafar's favourite wife until his death. This did not, however, stop the septuagenarian Zafar from contracting four further marriages in the years that followed, all to wives of relatively low status, as well as taking several new concubines: in 1853 there seem to have been at least five such women attached to the imperial bedchamber, judging by the fact that in July that year Zafar had five sets of silver feet made for their beds.<sup>40</sup> Zafar's harem seems in general to have been a remarkably active place, even into the Emperor's early eighties. Zafar fathered in all no fewer than sixteen sons and thirty-one daughters, his last son, Mirza Shah Abbas, being conceived as late as 1845 when the emperor was fully seventy years old.

There is no record of Zinat Mahal taking against any of the concubines – indeed, when one of them became pregnant by Tanras Khan, the court musician, Zinat intervened to spare her severe punishment.<sup>41</sup> But she seems to have remained permanently in a state of war with Taj Begum, and at one point even managed to have the latter imprisoned on suspicion of having an affair with one of Zafar's nephews, Mirza Kamran.<sup>42</sup> Taj denied the charge, but her conduct was widely believed to have been suspicious, and judging from the Palace diary she certainly seems to have spent more time at her house in the city, and to have come and gone from it at night by the back door more frequently than might have been wise for a queen concerned about maintaining proprieties.<sup>43</sup>

Zafar's harem was in general notoriously lax as far as discipline and security were concerned: as well as Piya Bai, who became pregnant by Tanras Khan, several other of his concubines were publicly accused of 'improprieties' at various times, and at least one other illicit pregnancy occurred: two months before Jawan Bakht's wedding, one of the sepoys stationed at the water gate on the Yamuna river frontage just below the

Palace took advantage of his station to conduct an affair with another unnamed slave girl who may well have been one of Zafar's concubines, and was sentenced to 'a whipping and confinement with irons' for his pains. The girl got off relatively lightly: she was merely 'sentenced to grind grain'.<sup>44</sup>

Only three days after the discovery of the pregnant slave girl, other strangers were found to be defying the guard eunuchs. According to the diary entry for 1 February 1852, Zafar immediately sent for the chamberlain, telling him 'he was much displeased at the arrangements of the *zenana* [harem]; that the *chaukidars* [guards] and *chobdars* [macebearers] were never present and that strangers were allowed access to the *zanan-khana;* that it was represented to him by Chand Bai Concubine that Nabi Bakhsh had forcibly entered the house of Sultan Bai, although the eunuch tried to prevent his doing so …'. The general impression is one of complete chaos, of a once-great establishment unable to maintain basic proprieties in reduced circumstances; it is certainly a very different picture to the closely guarded and impenetrable Mughal harem of orientalist myth. Whatever his other qualities, running the domestic arrangements of the Red Fort was clearly not one of Zafar's talents, at least in his old age.

Life for the senior princes could be extremely comfortable and Zafar's own children had a fair degree of freedom to live their own lives and follow their own interests and amusements, whether these lay in scholarly and artistic directions, or in hunting, pigeon flying and quail fighting. But the options open for the junior *salatin*, or Palace-born princes and princesses, could be extremely limited. Besides the senior princes, there were over two thousand poor princes and princesses – grandchildren and greatgrandchildren and great-great-grandchildren of previous monarchs – most of whom lived a life of poverty in their own walled quarter of the Palace, to the south-west of the area occupied by Zafar and his immediate family. 45 This was the darker side of the life of the Red Fort, and its greatest embarrassment; for this reason many of the *salatin* were never allowed out of the gates of the Fort, least of all on so ostentatious an occasion as the very public festivities in Daryaganj. According to one British observer:

The *salatin* quarter consists of an immense high wall so that nothing can overlook it. Within this are numerous mat huts in which these wretched objects live. When the gates were opened there was

a rush of miserable, half naked, starved beings who surrounded us. Some men apparently nearly 80 years old were almost in a state of nature.<sup>46</sup> .

Zafar, absorbed in his other worries, seems to have had fairly limited patience with the sufferings and misdemeanours of his more distant relatives. They tended to be responsible – so he believed – for most of the thefts and disturbances that took place within the Palace: on one occasion, when a thief was spotted darting along the walls of the Red Fort, Zafar remarked that 'it must have been one of the *salatin';* on another Zafar was quoted as remarking that 'the *salatin* were in the habit of stealing from one another' and 'of drinking and creating a disturbance'.<sup>47</sup> When Zafar was informed that one of the junior *salatin*, 'Mirza Mahmoud Sultan had become insane and was in the habit of wandering around the Palace at night', he did not hesitate to order that he should be 'confined with chains upon his feet'.<sup>48</sup>

Occasionally, however, the *salatin* broke their silence and created a more serious embarrassment for Zafar. Twice they had put together mass petitions addressed to the British Resident claiming that their basic rights were being abused. Ten years into Zafar's reign, in 1847, one hundred *salatin* signed a petition complaining to Metcalfe of oppression:

Our conditions have approached to the extreme of humiliation and poverty owing to the character and conduct of the King of Delhi who is entirely subject to the control of his servants and bad advisers … the subordinate members are exposed to every species of degradation and insult by [the chief eunuch] Mahbub Ali Khan and the favourites of the king.'<sup>49</sup>

A second revolt of the *salatin* took place a year later and was timed to coincide with the visit to Delhi of the British Lieutenant Governor of the North West Provinces. This time a large piece of parchment containing the seals of more than 150 *salatin* was presented to the governor asking for protection, and claiming that Zafar was trying to dissuade the heir apparent from meeting Metcalfe to discuss their grievances.<sup>50</sup>

This second petition touched on the most sensitive of the tensions within Zafar's household. For of all the restrictions that the British had imposed on Zafar, the one that rankled most of all was the withdrawal of his right to choose his own successor. Instead the British had imposed on the Mughals the alien European notion of primogeniture.

Zafar's attempts to appoint his own choice as heir apparent first surfaced when his oldest living son, Mirza Dara Bakht, died from a fever in 1849. The British assumed that Zafar's next son, the talented and popular poet, calligrapher and historian Mirza Fakhru, should become the heir apparent in Dara's place; but Zafar, pressed by the increasingly domineering Zinat Mahal, tried instead to insist on the succession of Mirza Jawan Bakht, then barely a boy of eight years old, and the fifteenth of Zafar's many sons.<sup>51</sup> As Zafar explained it in a letter written to the Lieutenant Governor:

among my other sons, no one appears to me so fit for the office as Mirza Jawan Bakht, who I am glad to say is endowed with natural good propensities. He has not as yet attained the age of maturity and has not been allowed to mix with people who are not upright. Besides, he is from my lawful wife, who is of very high family, Nawab Zinat Mahal… Under these circumstances therefore, he is most fit for the high office of Heir Apparent and he always remains under my Eyes, and devotes all his time to learning in different branches of education. I feel satisfied that he will never do anything contrary to my wishes.<sup>52</sup>

Zafar's objection to primogeniture was somewhat ironic, given that it was solely thanks to the British insisting on this principle that Zafar had himself come to the throne, much against the will of his father, Akbar Shah II. The latter had strived instead for the succession of Zafar's raffish younger brother Mirza Jahangir, and in the process developed so strong an objection to his eldest son that on 21 March 1807 he wrote a letter to the then British Resident, Archibald Seton, which closely prefigured that written by Bahadur Shah about Mirza Fakhru forty-two years later: 'My eldest son [i.e. Zafar]', wrote Akbar Shah, 'is wholly devoid of every qualification for occupying the throne.' He also accused him, without giving any evidence or details, 'of an offence against nature too delicate to admit explanation from us'.\*

Zafar now acted just as his father had done to him, and continued to push for Mirza Jawan Bakht. Meanwhile his passed-over eldest son, Mirza Fakhru, began learning English, and along with his ambitiously Anglophile father-in-law, Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh, began to ingratiate himself with both Metcalfe and the senior officers of the British military stationed in Delhi. It was in the end a successful campaign. After much negotiation, Mirza Fakhru met with Metcalfe and the Lieutenant Governor in January 1852, three months before the wedding, and signed a secret understanding: the British agreed formally to recognise him as heir apparent, contrary to his father's wish; but there was a quid pro quo. After more than two centuries, Mirza Fakhru would move the court from the Red Fort to the distant suburb of Mehrauli, handing over the old fort of Shah Jahan to the British, who would use it as a barrack and a powder magazine; and when he became Emperor, Fakhru would drop the Mughal's long-standing claim of superior status to the British Governor General, and would henceforth meet him on terms of equality. 53

When Zafar came to hear rumours about the terms of the agreement, he reacted with fury, believing that his son had bargained away two of the most sacred cornerstones of Mughal prestige: 'A tawny coloured dog may be mistaken for a jackal's brother,' he spat angrily – if somewhat enigmatically – to his attendants.<sup>54</sup> Mirza Fakhru was quickly subject to a boycott at court: 'anyone professing friendship with Mirza Fakhru was his declared enemy', announced Zafar – and Mirza Fakhru's various positions at court, his allowances, houses and estates, were all one by one given to his younger brothers, notably his ambitious and hard-working younger brother Mirza Mughal, the leading Anglophobe among the princes.<sup>55</sup>

As it gradually became clear, however, that nothing was going to change the British position, Zafar sank increasingly into impotent gloom, as he often did when frustrated. He announced that if his wishes were to be so blatantly ignored, he desired to abdicate and go on the haj: 'It is plain … that to this House nothing remains now but the bare name,' he wrote to Metcalfe.

It is to be regretted that my wishes do not meet the sanction of government & I feel greatly distressed on this account. I therefore feel anxious that I should no more prove troublesome to the government and go on a pilgrimage to Mecca & pass the few

remaining years of my life there. Because I see that I have lost this world, [but] I may not lose the other also, and I find myself unable in my old age to suffer grief.<sup>56</sup>

Metcalfe was at a loss how to react, and blamed what he saw as the increasingly baleful influence of Zinat Mahal: 'Hitherto when alone with HM I have always found him most plausible and rational,' Metcalfe wrote to Calcutta. 'But he has of late surrendered himself so completely to the guidance of the favourite wife, the Nawab Zinat Mahal, and her confidential advisor, the Chief Eunuch Mahbub Ali Khan, [that he] is induced to commit many unreasonable acts.'<sup>57</sup>

By the middle of March 1852, however, Zafar seems to have cheered up slightly, and to have pinned his hopes on one last attempt to change the Resident's mind. He abandoned his plan to go on the haj and threw himself into making arrangements for the wedding of Jawan Bakht. He seems to have believed – or to have been persuaded by Zinat Mahal – that if the wedding were made sufficiently magnificent, such would be the prestige of the bridegroom that the British might yet be forced to take Zafar's choice of successor seriously. Certainly contemporaries assumed that the magnificent wedding was Zafar's last-ditch attempt at persuading Metcalfe to recognise Jawan Bakht, and it did result in the *Delhi Gazette* openly referring to the young groom as the heir apparent.<sup>58</sup>

Yet in the end, the whole ruinously expensive strategy – and indeed the whole project of the marriage – was a catastrophic failure. For Metcalfe, well aware of what was going on, did not make an appearance at any point during the twelve days of the wedding celebrations, thus comprehensively snubbing the entire affair.

Sir Thomas Theophilus Metcalfe had been in Delhi nearly forty years by 1852, and knew well both the city and its ruler.

He was a slight, delicate, bookish figure with an alert, intelligent expression, a bald pate and bright blue eyes. His daughter Emily thought 'he could not be said to be handsome' but believed he did have the redeeming feature 'of beautifully small hands and feet'. Certainly he was a notably fastidious man, with feelings so refined that he could not bear to see women eat cheese. Moreover he believed that if the fair sex insisted on eating oranges or mangoes, they should at least do so in the privacy of their own bathrooms.

He would never have dreamt of dressing, as some of his predecessors had, in full Mughal *pagri* and *jama*. Still less would he have dreamt of imitating the example of the first British Resident at the Mughal court, Sir David Ochterlony, who every evening was said to take all thirteen of his Indian wives on a promenade around the walls of the Red Fort, each on the back of her own elephant.<sup>59</sup> Instead, a widower, he lived alone, and arranged that his London tailors, Pulford of St James's, should regularly send out to Delhi a chest of sober but fashionable English clothes.

His one concession to Indian taste was to smoke a silver hookah. This he did every day after breakfast, for exactly thirty minutes. If ever one of his servants failed to perform his appointed duty, Metcalfe would call for a pair of white kid gloves. These he would pick up from their silver salver and slowly pull on over his delicate white fingers. Then, 'with solemn dignity', having lectured the servant on his failing, he 'proceeded to pinch gently but firmly the ear of the culprit, and then let him go – a reprimand that was entirely efficacious'.<sup>60</sup>

Sir Thomas had enjoyed an exceptionally happy marriage, but his wife Felicity died quite suddenly of an unexplained fever in September 1842, at the age of only thirty-four. In the decade that followed, with his six children all in boarding school in England, Metcalfe withdrew in his grief into himself. He became so set in his ways that by the time his children began returning to India in the early 1850s, they found that their father had became a stickler for propriety and punctuality, and greatly resented any disruption to his routine. By the early 1850s this routine was so firmly established as to be something almost set down in stone: 'He always got up at five o'clock every morning,' wrote his daughter Emily,

and having put on his dressing gown he would go to the verandah and have his *chota haziri* [small breakfast]. He used to take a walk

up and down the verandah, and his different servants came at that time to receive their orders for the day. At seven o'clock he would go down to the swimming bath which he built just below the corner of the verandah, and then having dressed and had prayers in the oratory, he was ready for breakfast at eight o'clock.

Everything was ordered with the greatest punctuality, and all the household arrangements moved as if by clock work. After he had his breakfast, his hookah was brought in and placed beside his chair… When he had finished his smoke he went to his study to write letters until the carriage was announced. This always appeared at exactly ten o'clock under the portico, and he passed through a row of servants on his way to it – one holding his hat, another his gloves, another his handkerchief, another his gold headed cane, and another his despatch box. These having been put into the carriage, his Jamadar mounted beside the coachman and drove away, with two syces standing up behind <sup>61</sup>

With no family to soften him, and a dislike for the noise of society, Metcalfe threw himself into his work, in particular negotiating a succession settlement that would allow the Company to expel the royal family from the Red Fort on the death of Zafar. He had some affection, but little real respect, for the man he was determined should be the last of the Timurid line. Although to Zafar's face he was always extremely polite, and would write to the Emperor as 'my Royal Illustrious friend … I beg to express the high consideration I entertain for your Majesty and subscribe myself as your Majesty's sincere friend', in private he was sometimes less generous.<sup>62</sup> '[Zafar] is mild and talented,' he wrote to Emily, 'but lamentably weak and vacillating and impressed with very erroneous notions of his own importance, productive of great mortification to himself and occasionally of much trouble to the local authorities.'<sup>63</sup>

Yet Metcalfe's attitude to Delhi and its Emperor was much more ambiguous than this might suggest. He was very proud of the resounding Persian titles given to him by Zafar, and commissioned various calligraphed versions of them which he later had bound into an album.\* Moreover, almost against his better instincts, he slowly came to be fascinated with the

fabulous city he presided over: 'There is something in this place to which the mind cannot be indifferent,' he wrote.

The ruins of grandeur that extend for miles on every side fill it with serious reflection. The palaces crumbling into dust… the myriads of vast mausoleums, every one of which was intended to convey to futurity the deathless fame of its cold inhabitant, and all of which are now passed by, unknown and unnoticed … These things cannot be looked at with indifference …<sup>64</sup>

In due course, Metcalfe systematically visited all the different antiquities of the city and founded a Delhi Archaeological Society dedicated to uncovering the history behind Delhi's monuments, of which the young Sayyid Ahmad Khan was an enthusiastic and energetic member. The society had its own journal, most of whose articles Metcalfe personally commissioned from the intelligentsia of the city, and duly translated himself from Urdu into English.

Unlike most British officials – who regarded their stay in India as a temporary affair, and who waited eagerly for the moment when they could sail home with their accumulated savings to set themselves up back in Britain – Metcalfe took the decision to bring all his family possessions to India, and in Delhi built for himself not one but two large country houses, in addition to his new Residency office, known as Ludlow Castle,\* which stood outside the city walls in the recently built British Civil Lines to the north of the city.

In his letters, Metcalfe sometimes envisaged himself as an English country squire. In reality, however, he seems to have had slightly more exalted ambitions, and to some extent he set up his establishment as a rival court to that of Zafar, with the Metcalfes as a parallel dynasty to the Mughals. Metcalfe House, also known as Jahan Numa ('World Showing'), his expansive and palatial Palladian bungalow on the banks of the Yamuna to the north of the city, was an indirect challenge to the Red Fort, a little downstream of it. If the Red Fort had its marble domes, its scented night gardens with their bubbling irrigation runnels and floating pavilions, then Metcalfe House had its flower beds with its English blooms, its marble columns and its swimming pool, its cypress avenues and orange groves, a library of 25,000 books, fine oil paintings and rosewood Georgian furniture.

It also had a Napoleon Gallery filled with memorabilia of Bonaparte, including the Emperor's own diamond ring and a bust by Canova.

To the south of Delhi, Metcalfe established a second country house, Dilkusha (or Delighter of the Heart), in a converted octagonal Mughal tomb near Mehrauli, which became Metcalfe's answer to the nearby Mughal summer palace of Zafar Mahal; a Mughal garden – a four-part *char-bagh* – was laid out in front of the tomb house just to emphasise the parallel. Both Metcalfe's houses were surrounded by extensive estates, and were entered through colossal Georgian gateways; both were decorated with follies, and even, in the case of Dilkusha, a lighthouse, a small fort, a pigeon house, a boating pond and an ornamental ziggurat.

Like Zafar, Metcalfe was a generous patron of Delhi's artists. Between 1842 and 1844 he commissioned a whole series of images of the monuments, ruins, palaces and shrines of the city from a Delhi artist named Mazhar Ali Khan, who was also a favourite artist of Zafar's. Metcalfe had the images bound into an album, entitled *The Dehlie Book*, and wrote a long descriptive text as an accompaniment. This in due course he sent to his daughter Emily as she made her way home from an English schooling to join her father in Delhi. He also commissioned a remarkable panoramic scroll of the city, some 20 feet long. Together the two commissions remain the most complete visual picture of pre-Mutiny Delhi now extant.<sup>65</sup>

The commissions are also great works of art in their own right. Mazhar Ali Khan had clearly been trained in the old Mughal techniques, but working for Metcalfe, using English watercolours on English paper, and taking English architectural elevations as his models, an extraordinary fusion of English and Indian artistic impulses took place, a fusion that resulted in a new type of painting, known today as the Company School.

The brilliance and simplicity of the colours, the meticulous, almost hypnotic attention to detail, the gem-like highlights, the way the picture seems to *glow*, all these point unmistakably towards Mazhar Ali Khan's Mughal training: no English artist would have thought of using the astonishing palette of colours that still stands out like a small aesthetic firework display; the tentative washes of a memsahib's watercolour are a world away from this work. Yet the almost fanatical Mughal attention to fine detail is fused with a scientific European rationalism to produce an architectural painting that both observes and feels the qualities of a building. Thus while the picture of the tomb of Ghazi ud-Din in the Delhi

College complex minutely reproduces the proportions and detail of the Mughal domes of the mosque behind it, the artist has also understood the ideal of lightness and delicacy that the architect was aiming at, and has produced an image of the building as fine and as fragile as a lace ruff: the tomb is so delicate and ethereal it could almost be blown away with a breath.

But it was not just as a patron of the arts that Sir Thomas had much in common with Zafar: in many other ways too their situations shared unexpected parallels. Politically, they both had a faint sense that they had somehow been passed over: however grandly Metcalfe might swagger through the *muhallas* of Delhi, the truth was that many of Metcalfe's juniors had long since shot past him in the Company's service: John Lawrence, for example, once one of Metcalfe's assistants, had now risen several ranks above him and was Governor of the newly conquered Punjab. More galling still, Metcalfe's elder brother Charles, who had preceded him as Resident in Delhi, had now acquired a peerage and been promoted from acting Governor General in Calcutta to actual Governor General in Canada. Thomas Metcalfe, meanwhile, remained firmly ensconced in his old position in Delhi. It was a good but hardly very senior position in the Company's civil service, despite Delhi's long history as the capital of Hindustan and the centre of the Mughal Empire. This was especially so after 1833 when the new Presidency of the North West Provinces was created, administered by a lieutenant governor based in Agra, so further reducing the authority of the Delhi Resident.\*

Moreover, the family situations of Metcalfe and Zafar were in many ways surprisingly similar. If Zafar increasingly found himself at odds with his eldest son and heir, then so too did Metcalfe. For Metcalfe's son Theophilus (or Theo as he was known), a junior magistrate in the Company's service, newly returned to India after ten years' absence at school in England, was a very different figure from his father. Where Sir Thomas was reserved and particular, Theo was sociable and expansive and also, when he wished to be, extremely charming. If the father liked solitude and disliked the business of entertaining, Theo was noisy and convivial, and enjoyed parties, riding, horses and dogs. If his father was resolutely selfdisciplined and law-abiding, Theo had a tendency to cut corners, and get into what his father described as 'scrapes'.<sup>66</sup> It was hardly surprising, therefore, that the two had a somewhat strained relationship.

For this reason, Sir Thomas was more than a little alarmed when in April 1851, exactly a year before Jawan Bakht's marriage, he received a letter from Theo announcing that he had just been posted to Delhi. 'I tell you candidly that I fear our reunion,' Sir Thomas wrote to his middle daughter Georgina, known in the family as GG.

At my time of life, I do not wish to be put out of my way and play second fiddle in my own house. Your brother I know from experience: all must give way to his wishes. My temper is hasty too, and I keep it always under control. But I feel the result [of this]. [Moreover] I shall have to set him up with buggy and horses. I was snubbed the other day by a friend of mine who said – 'if you do not insist on his living within his salary, he is quite right to draw upon you'. This is a troubling letter [to write] – but my bile will evaporate …<sup>67</sup>

In the postscript, however, Metcalfe's tone grew more apprehensive still:

After I wrote to you yesterday, dearest GG, the *Delhi Gazette* came in and in a paragraph of the 'Calcutta correspondents" letter, is one allusion to an illegal act of a civil nature which, I fear has reference to your brother. If so, he has not only angered Lord Dalhousie and will be removed, but also in all probability will be prosecuted in the Supreme Court, and is likely to be [fined] cash in damages of some 10 or 12,000 rupees, which I of course, shall have to pay rather than he have to go to jail. This is a precious mess and if all I fear takes place, I cannot afford to bring out your sister [from England]. How frightening it is that Theo could not act with discretion and judgement. His extravagance is bad enough.<sup>68</sup>

Sir Thomas had always found his relationships with his daughters easier than those with his sons, and his correspondence with both Emily and GG was invariably warm and intimate. In 1852, however, at the same time as Zafar was struggling with the affairs taking place in his harem, Sir Thomas was busy trying to forbid the passionate love affair of the twenty-one-yearold Georgina.

Much to Metcalfe's horror, Georgina had fallen for a young Scottish army captain named Sir Edward Campbell. Campbell was a protégé and former ADC to his fellow Scot, Sir Charles Napier, the former Commanderin-Chief of the British Army in India, with whom Sir Thomas had had a serious disagreement; to make matters worse, despite his title, Campbell was more or less penniless. He and Georgina had met one morning in the house of the Company's medical officer in Delhi, Dr Grant, over a pianoforte which GG had gone to tune; and by evening they were singing parlour songs together, chaperoned by Captain Douglas, Commander of the Palace Guards.<sup>69</sup>

As soon as Sir Thomas found out about the affair he forbade the couple from corresponding and GG promptly went on a hunger strike. When Metcalfe took her up to the newly built hill station of Mussoorie for a change of air, she sat waiting for her lover's letters, each of which was promptly confiscated by her father on arrival. 'My beloved,' wrote the lovesick GG to Campbell from her Mussoorie bedroom after her father had retired for the night,

It is so hard to see letters come from you & to feel I may not read or see them since I know they are come! Oh! Edward! I should be so purely happy if I might write to and hear from you! One little note a week Edward would give me such intense joy. I cannot see the indelicacy and find it appears to me incomprehensible how anyone can entertain such an idea under existing circumstances. Are we not sure? Oh yes in everything now … <sup>70</sup>

Metcalfe, who was so adept at controlling the many princes of the House of Timur, found himself powerless in the face of the pain and despair of a single twenty-one-year-old girl. He returned to Delhi, leaving GG in the hills, writing helplessly from Dilkusha that

I trust you will allow the fine climate to have fair play with you and that you will eat and recollect that you have a father who loves you and is grieved to witness your present state both of body and mind, and that whatever annoyance he may have caused you proceeded from sincere affection and a sense of duty. No father can do more.<sup>71</sup>
