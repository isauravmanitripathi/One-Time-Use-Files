'I have no son by him, and I don't intend to budge.' 'Very well, Mrs Taj Mahal,' replied Ommaney.

Then there were the Buddhist monasteries with their massive bells and winged gryphons; their giant Buddhas and bodhisattvas; their carved wooden struts and bamboo partitions and cane latticework; their stupas and pilgrimage sites; and everywhere, red- and yellow-robed monks with their wooden begging bowls. The silken <i>htamein</i> wraps and sequined parasols of the women, and the <i>pasoe</i> sarongs of their menfolk; the gold lacquerwork and delicate decorative pottery; the music of the street bands; the calm blue lakes that once belonged to the Burmese kings; the strange form of the <i>hle-yin</i> bullock carts with their finely woven bamboo roofs and floral side panels; the pungent Burmese cooking smells – all would have been quite new to the Mughals.</p>",

All that was left by the end of the year was about one fifth of the original fabric – principally a few scattered, isolated marble buildings strung out along the Yamuna waterfront. These were saved owing largely to the fact than they were in use as offices and messes by the British occupation troops, but their architectural logic was completely lost once they were shorn of the courtyards of which they were originally a part.</p>",

None to write poetry, and none to judge its worth.' To make matters worse for Ghalib, much of his own verse – his life's great achievement – had been lost: he had never kept copies of his ghazals and the two private libraries in which his friends had stored his poetry had both been sacked and destroyed by the British. 'A few days ago a faqir who has a good voice and sings well discovered a ghazal of mine somewhere and got it written down,' he wrote in one letter.

The old man was spoon-fed on broth, but by 3 November found it increasingly difficult to get even that down. On the 5th, Davies wrote that 'the Civil Surgeon does not think Abu Zafar can survive many days'. The following day, Davies reported that the old man 'is evidently sinking from pure decrepitude and paralysis in the region of his throat'. In preparation for the death, Davies ordered that bricks and lime be collected, and a secluded spot at the back of Zafar's enclosure was prepared for the burial.</p>",

Immediately the machinery of the Empire swung into action to make sure that the passing of the Last Mughal would be as discreet and uneventful as possible. Zafar's death may have marked the end of a great ruling dynasty 350 years old, but Davies was determined that as few as possible would witness this sad and historic moment. 'All things being in readiness,' wrote Davies, 'he was buried at 4 p.m. on the same day at the rear of the Main Guard in a brick grave, covered over with turf level with the ground.' Davies noted how his two boys and their father's manservant attended the burial, but the women, in accordance with Muslim custom, did not.</p>",

The dramatic way in which both Hindus and Muslims had rallied to the Mughal capital at the outbreak of the Uprising had demonstrated the degree to which the mystique of the dynasty was still very much alive more than a century after the Mughals had ceased to exercise any real political, economic or military power. Contrary to all expectations, the idea of the Mughal Emperor as the divinely ordained <i>axis mundi</i>, the universal sovereign, and <i>Padshah</i>, Lord of the World, still had resonance across Hindustan at this time. Even more surprisingly, and contrary to many modern assumptions, it clearly resonated as strongly for Hindus as it did for Muslims. As Mark Thornhill had written, sitting in Mathura shortly after the sepoys arrived from Meerut, listening to his office staff excitedly discuss the revival of the Mughal throne:</p>",

Zafar may have commanded the nominal loyalty and allegiance of the sepoys and his people, but that loyalty did not stretch to either direct obedience or submission, especially when his treasury was shown to be empty, and the weakness of Zafar's personal authority became apparent. The crucial failure to get even the hinterland of Delhi to submit to Zafar's rule, or to organise a proper logistical apparatus to feed the troops gathered within the walls, meant that the massive – and largely Hindu – army that collected so quickly and strikingly at Delhi soon ran out of food, and before long was brought to the edge of starvation. For this reason it was already well on the way to dispersing long before the British entered the Kashmiri Gate to deliver the <i>coup de grâce</i>.</p>",

Only ninety years separated the British victory at the gates of Delhi in 1857 from the British eviction from South Asia through the Gateway of India in 1947. But while memories of British atrocities in 1857 may have assisted in the birth of Indian nationalism, as did the growing separation and mutual suspicion of rulers and ruled that followed the Uprising, it was not the few surviving descendants of the Mughals, nor any of the old princely and feudal rulers, who were in any way responsible for India's march to independence. Instead, the Indian freedom movement was led by the new Anglicised and educated Colonial Service class who emerged from Englishlanguage schools after 1857, and who by and large used modern Western democratic structures and methods – political parties, strikes and protest marches – to gain their freedom.</p>",

Although a Bahadur Shah Zafar road still survives in Delhi, as indeed do roads named after all the other Great Mughals, for many Indians today, rightly or wrongly, the Mughals are still perceived as it suited the British to portray them in the imperial propaganda that they taught in Indian schools after 1857: as sensual, decadent, temple-destroying invaders – something that was forcefully and depressingly demonstrated by the whole episode of the demoliton of the Baburi Masjid at Ayodhya in 1992. The profoundly sophisticated, liberal and plural civilisation championed by Akbar, Dara Shukoh or the later Mughal emperors has only a limited resonance for the urban middle class in modern India. Many of these are now deeply ambivalent about the achievements of the Mughals, even if they will still happily eat a Mughal meal, or flock to the cinema to watch a Bollywood Mughal epic, or indeed head to the Red Fort to hear their Prime Minister</p>",

There was nothing left for his supporters to cling on to, not even a coherent political idea. With his death, followed seven years later by that of Ghalib, the self-esteem and confidence of an entire civilisation also passed away, so discredited it could never hope to be revived.</p>",

In some ways, it is true, his life can be seen as a study in failure: after all, he presided over the great collapse of Indo-Islamic civilisation, and his contribution to the Uprising of 1857 was hardly heroic. He is blamed by some nationalist historians for corresponding with the British during the fighting, and by others for failing to lead the rebels to victory. Yet it is difficult to see what more Zafar could have done, at least at the age of eighty-two. He was physically infirm, partially senile and had no money to pay the troops who flocked to his standard. Octogenarians can hardly lead a cavalry charge. Try as he might, he was powerless even to stop the looting of Delhi by an insurgent army that proved almost as much a threat to Zafar's subjects as it did to his enemies. Yet the Mutiny Papers bear eloquent witness to the energy he expended trying to protect his people and his city.</p>",

He is certainly a strikingly liberal and likeable figure when compared to the Victorian Evangelicals whose insensitivity, arrogance and blindness did much to bring the Uprising of 1857 down upon both their own heads and those of the people and court of Delhi, engulfing all of northern India in a religious war of terrible violence.</p>",

With their backs to the wall, they reacted against what the founders saw as the degenerate and rotten ways of the old Mughal elite.
