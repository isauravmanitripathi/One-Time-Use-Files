## **12 THE LAST OF THE GREAT MUGHALS**

'The ex-King and the other prisoners stand the travelling wonderfully well,' reported Lieutenant Ommaney on 13 October. 'They are all in very good spirits. I have the prisoners comfortably settled in their tents by 8 a.m. every morning, and other than getting them up every day at 1 a.m. [for the day's march] have very little bother. 1

Zafar had always enjoyed outings, processions and expeditions, and in his youth setting out hunting in the country around Delhi had been one of his principal forms of amusement; even in his old age, his monsoon breaks at his summer palace in Mehrauli had often been excuses for extended shooting trips in the jungle to the south. But he had never in his life travelled farther than a day or two from his capital, and his passage into exile was the longest journey he had ever taken. Now, after the intense stress of the Uprising and siege, and the humiliation of his imprisonment and trial, the journey into exile was, if not exactly a holiday, then at least a relative relief from the horrors he had undergone during the previous eighteen months.

The party travelled in convoy. A squadron of the Lancers cavalry trotted ahead as an advance guard. Then came the canopied palanquin carriage carrying Zafar and his two sons, surrounded on all four sides by groups of Lancers. Next came the closed purdah carriage of Zinat Mahal, who travelled with Mirza Jawan Bakht's young wife, Nawab Shah Zamani Begum, and her mother, Mubarak un-Nissa. The third carriage carried the queen Taj Mahal and her attendants, including her eunuch, 'a quiet inoffensive youth' called Khwajah Balish (which meant cushion).<sup>2</sup> Behind trailed five 'magazine store carts with tilted tops, drawn by bullocks', containing the male and female attendants and Zafar's harem women, four in every cart, each escorted by a party of Lancers.

Other than a near-accident on the Bridge of Boats, when one of the store carts almost tipped Zafar's concubines into the Yamuna, there were no upsets and no complaints, and the family particularly approved of the arrangements Ommaney had made for their camp: a 'hill tent' shared by Zafar and his sons, and a 'soldier's tent, with kunnat [canvas zenana screening] enclosure' for the ladies.<sup>3</sup> The weather was perfect – the mornings and nights cool, the days bright and warm – and on arrival at Kanpur, the Mughals in the party were amazed by the sight of their first steam train 'receiving its passengers, and shortly afterwards away it went with its regular puffs and peculiar whistle', while a band played 'The Englishman' on the platform.<sup>4</sup> The King even confided to Ommaney that he was looking forward to seeing the sea and travelling on a ship, saying he had never been on anything larger than a riverboat before.

Only the constant evidence of recent fighting around them – the ruined and fire-blackened bungalows, and the burned-out police stations – acted as a reminder to the party of the grim cause of their journey. Very occasionally, they came across actual fighting: at one point Zafar came within sight of the rebel-held fort of Suniah, which British troops were in the process of storming, and for much of the last stage of the journey to Allahabad they passed along the edge of rebel-held territory. <sup>5</sup> There was also a single fatal accident: 'some of the Lancers taking their horses to water, one got into deep water, lost his seat and the horse kept him under for some seconds. His body was not recovered for three quarters of an hour'.<sup>6</sup>

The novelty of the journey also delighted Zafar's companions, who were said to be in high spirits: 'By all accounts the prisoners are cheerful,'

reported George Wagentrieber in the *Delhi Gazette*, 'and the females may be heard talking and laughing behind their screens as if they did not much regret their departure from Delhi.'<sup>7</sup>

This was a striking contrast to their mood towards the end of their Delhi imprisonment when, in addition to the humiliations heaped on them by the British, the imperial family added to their miseries by feuding among themselves. According to Ommaney, prior to their departure Zinat Mahal had been squabbling loudly with Jawan Bakht after the latter had fallen in love with one of his father's harem women. He also began using the family's now scarce financial resources to bribe the guards to bring him bottles of porter: 'What an instance of the state of morals and domestic economy of Ex-Royalty,' wrote a disapproving Ommaney to Saunders. 'Mother and son at enmity, the son trying to form a connection with his father's concubine, and setting at nought the precepts of his religion, buying from, and drinking, the liquor of an infidel.'<sup>8</sup>

Before setting off, Zinat Mahal had also had a loud series of arguments with her old rival and enemy Taj Mahal, who had been imprisoned for three years prior to the Mutiny on the grounds that she was having an affair with Zafar's nephew, Mirza Kamran. Taj Mahal was therefore one of the very few people in Delhi whose lot had demonstrably improved because of the outbreak. But following the argument, Taj promptly announced she wanted nothing to do with either Zinat Mahal or Zafar, and moved down to the far end of the corridor from them: 'I have nothing to do with the King,' she told Ommaney. 'I have no son by him, and I don't intend to budge.' 'Very well, Mrs Taj Mahal,' replied Ommaney. 'Go you must to the ex-King's Quarters, and if you don't go of your own accord I must take you there forcibly.' Taj replied, 'You may kill me, but I'll not go.'<sup>9</sup> As Ommaney wrote to Saunders, 'The Ex-King's party dislike her, so altogether she'll be a great nuisance.'

For the first few weeks of the journey, the pleasures of travelling and the joy of freedom from incarceration in a squalid corridor at the back of their own palace seem to have lulled the various feuds in the royal family. But as the party neared Allahabad, the tensions again became apparent, and on arrival at the old Mughal fort there,\* now held by the British, half the party – led by Taj Begum, and including Zafar's concubines and Mirza Jawan Bakht's mother-in-law and sister-in-law – decided to return to Delhi rather

than continue on into exile. Only fifteen out of the original party of thirtyone chose to carry on with Zafar.

While waiting to resolve this issue Canning, who also happened to be in Allahabad, met with Ommaney (though significantly, not with Zafar) and told him that he had firmly decided that Burma, rather than the Cape, should be the ex-Emperor's place of exile. He was, however, still undecided whether the deposed monarch should remain at Rangoon, or should be sent up the country to Tounghoo in the Karen hill territories, 'which offers the advantage of being isolated, and so far removed from the usual line of travellers and traffic that no stranger, least of all a native of Hindoostan, can enter it without attracting the immediate attention of the authorities'.<sup>10</sup>

In the meantime, Zafar had a medical check. The doctors' report decided that 'allowing for the natural decay attending his advanced age, his general physical condition is good beyond what we anticipated to find, that he is hale and vigorous for his age, and free from diseases'.

The committee can see no objection on professional grounds to his removal by sea to Rangoon or to his future residence there or some other place in the Province of Pegu [southern Burma]. On the contrary, as compared with the Upper Provinces [of Hindustan], the climate of Pegu is mild and soft and equable throughout the year, and not liable to the considerable vicissitudes of temperature experienced in the North Western Provinces of India, and on this account possessing conditions generally considered favourable to the prolongation of life in its advanced stages."<sup>11</sup>

Having made his decision regarding to which country he wanted Zafar to be sent, Canning then wrote to Major Phayre, the Commissioner in Rangoon, laying down the ground rules than were to govern the future treatment of the imperial family: 'It is the desire of His Excellency the Governor-General,' Major Phayre was informed,

that the prisoners should be kept in close custody, and permitted to hold no communication whatever, either verbal or written, with any person or persons, other than those who as will be precisely mentioned, will accompany them … Care should be taken that the prisoners should be treated with care and civility, and be exposed to

no indignity, and to no other discomfort than may be necessary for their safe custody … Maintenance is to be liberal in every respect, but it is not expedient that any of them should receive allowances in money.

'Lt Ommaney will remain in immediate charge of the prisoners and their companions,' added Canning. 'He should be required to visit the prisoners daily and to attend to their wants, bringing to your notice, without delay, any circumstances which seem to him of any significance or importance.'<sup>12</sup>

The reduced party of fifteen continued on from Allahabad on 16 November. Two days later they reached Mirzapur and embarked on the steamer *Thames*. 'The state prisoners do not show any anxiety,' reported Ommaney, 'and the old man seems quite jolly, saying "It is the first time he has ever been on board a ship."' <sup>13</sup> They steamed slowly down the Ganges, past the magnificent ghats and temples of Benares. Shortly afterwards they passed a pair of British gunboats patrolling for rebels who might be crossing the river near the site of the battle of Buxar. Here the Mughals and the British had first come into conflict in 1764, during the reign of Zafar's grandfather Shah Alam – a battle than had begun the British territorial advance from Bengal up the country towards Delhi.<sup>14</sup> At Rampur they changed boats to the steamer *Koyle*, after the *Thames* developed engine trouble, and arrived at Diamond Harbour, the anchorage below Calcutta, on 4 December.\*

Here Zafar's party were quickly transferred to the HMS *Magara*. The ship let slip its moorings, and the last Mughal Emperor steamed away from his homeland, never to return. According to an observer on the riverbank,

On the 4th December, at ten in the morning, the ex-King of Delhi was taken aboard Her Majesty's good ship of war, the *Magara*, which for a vessel of the Royal Navy presented a curious spectacle at the time, crowded as her main deck was with household furniture, live and lifeless stock in the shape of cattle, goats, rabbits, poultry, rice, peas &c &c, brought by the Royal prisoner and his attendants, for their consumption and comfort. Lt Ommaney of the 59th, who has had charge of him ever since he was taken,

conducted him on this, probably the last conveyance that will ever again serve him on his peregrinations.

He had two wives\* with him, so impenetrably veiled that they were led below by guides. He looked utterly broken up, and in his dotage; but not a bad type of Eastern face and manner – something King-like about his deeply furrowed countenance, and lots of robes and Cashmeres.† He was quite self-possessed, and was heard to ask some of the officers what their respective positions were on board, &c.

A son and grandson‡ are with him, and their very first care on touching the deck with their feet was to ask for cheroots – took things easy in short. The ex-King meanwhile went below, and was said to have stretched himself forthwith upon a couch of pillows and cushions, which his folk had arranged for him in a twinkling. The whole operation of transferring him and his companions was quickly effected; and then the guard of the 84th regiment returned to Calcutta, while the *Magara* steamed away down the Hooghly for its destination.

The voyage lasted five days. On 8 December, the *Magara* left the open ocean and sailed up the muddy brown waters of the swampy tidal creeks bordering the Irrawaddy Delta and into the Rangoon river. From far away, the passengers could see the great golden spire of the Shwe Dagon pagoda rising up above the thick tropical greenery of the riverbank: 'The pagoda is a magnificent object,' wrote Ommaney. 'I saw it 20 miles off directly we entered the river. There are three terraces of brickwork. From the centre of the upper one rises a heap of chaotic architecture which again throws up an elegant structure to a great height, all gilded with gold leaf.'<sup>15</sup>

On arrival at the port of Rangoon, according to an irritated Ommaney, 'a very large crowd of Natives and Europeans assembled to see the prisoners land and proceed to their quarters'.<sup>16</sup> Further annoyances followed. Food proved far more expensive in Rangoon than it was in India, as did domestic staff, whose failure to salaam like the defeated and terror-stricken Delhiwallahs angered Ommaney: the 'independence and impudence of the servants exceeds belief, he wrote to Saunders a week later. 'Their manner

appears as if they thought they were conferring a favour by entering your service. I am positively struck dumb by their cool insolence.'

Most irritating of all, the Commissioner, Major Phayre, had done little to prepare for Zafar's arrival, and no proper housing was ready for their reception: 'Major Phayre does not know where the prisoners are to be permanently confined,' wrote Ommaney.

At present two little rooms, neither so large as any in the house at Delhi are set apart for them [near the Main Guard in the new cantonment area just below the Shwe Dagon] and the attendants have 4 tents pitched adjacent, and surrounded by a kanat [or *qanat*, canvas zenana screening] enclosure. The prisoners now have scarcely any comfort. The Government is bound to treat them better than this.<sup>17</sup>

If Rangoon was defiantly uncongenial for Ommaney, and for Zafar and his party, the town must have been above all strikingly unfamiliar: quite apart from the novelty of a hot tropical river port fringed with toddy palms and crowded with paddle steamers, rafts of teak logs and junk-like *hnaw* fishing boats with their billowing sails, there was the town's Burmese architecture with its tiers of gilded spires and finials and flying eaves. Then there were the Buddhist monasteries with their massive bells and winged gryphons; their giant Buddhas and bodhisattvas; their carved wooden struts and bamboo partitions and cane latticework; their stupas and pilgrimage sites; and everywhere, red- and yellow-robed monks with their wooden begging bowls. The silken *htamein* wraps and sequined parasols of the women, and the *pasoe* sarongs of their menfolk; the gold lacquerwork and delicate decorative pottery; the music of the street bands; the calm blue lakes that once belonged to the Burmese kings; the strange form of the *hle-yin* bullock carts with their finely woven bamboo roofs and floral side panels; the pungent Burmese cooking smells – all would have been quite new to the Mughals.

Yet for all that there was much in the abject political situation of the town which directly echoed that of the Delhi they had just left behind. In April 1852, on the very same day that Jawan Bakht was getting married to Shah Zamani Begum and processing in triumph through the streets of Mughal Delhi, an army of Company troops, including a regiment of Sikhs,

had invaded Rangoon, following a show of defiance by the port's *Shwebo Wun* (Governor) against two British sea captains accused of murdering Indian members of their own crews. After British naval artillery had breached the stockades and the Burmese troops had been driven back towards Mandalay, Prize Agents had been let loose to loot the holy shrines and smash the sacred idols in search of gems.

As in Delhi, much unofficial looting had also taken place: 'the work of delving into every image in the place', reported the *Calcutta Englishman*, 'of which there are many, was perseveringly carried out, but apparently not with the knowledge of the Prize Agents, as the European Artillery sold in great numbers the silver images and the bottles of rubies that were found inside'.<sup>18</sup> One party of looters even tunnelled deep into the foundations of the great Shwe Dagon pagoda, determined to find the thick cladding of gems that legend said had been buried there. Now a regiment of Sikhs camped in the desecrated courts of the Shwe Dagon, just as their cousins sat lighting their cooking fires in the arcades of the Delhi Jama Masjid.

Moreover, just prior to the arrival of the prisoners, the British had begun sweeping away the ancient fishing village of Mon on the Rangoon waterfront, with its hundreds of old Buddhist landmarks and pilgrimage shrines. Gangs of impressed Burmese labourers were now in the process of clearing the debris and laying out on its ruins a new colonial town on an ordered gridiron plan.

Even as Zafar stepped ashore at Rangoon, a similar programme of mass destruction and colonial remodelling was beginning to remove many of the most familiar and beautiful landmarks of the former Mughal capital he had just left behind.

![](_page_7_Picture_4.jpeg)

'Here it seems as if the whole city is being demolished,' wrote Ghalib about this time. 'Some of the biggest and most famous bazaars – the Khas Bazaar, the Urdu Bazaar and the Khanum ka Bazaar, each of which was practically as a small town, have all gone without a trace. You cannot even tell where they were. Householders and shopkeepers cannot point out to you where

their houses and shops used to stand … Food is dear, and death is cheap, and grain sells so dear that you would think each grain was a fruit.'<sup>19</sup>

What Ghalib was describing was in fact a very reduced version of the plan, originally mooted by the *Lahore Chronicle*, to completely level Delhi as a punishment for being the centre of the defeated rebellion. The plan had many powerful supporters, both in India and London, one of whom, Lord Palmerston, wrote that Delhi should be deleted from the map, and 'every civil building connected with the Mohammedan tradition should be levelled to the ground without regard to antiquarian veneration or artistic predilections'.<sup>20</sup> Lord Canning had at first been quite open to the *Chronicle's* suggestions, but was eventually, and reluctantly, persuaded not to order the levelling of the city. The man who persuaded him was John Lawrence.

Lawrence had spent several years at the beginning of his career in Delhi, serving as an assistant to Sir Thomas Metcalfe, and had grown fond of the Mughal capital. As Chief Commissioner of the Punjab he had done as much as anyone else to facilitate the British victory in 1857, and so was in a good position to argue his colleagues out of their plans for mass destruction and legalised mass murder, both of which were currently taking place under the guise of a just retribution.

One of Lawrence's first actions when the administration of Delhi was formally transferred to the Punjab government in February 1858 was to get Theo Metcalfe sent back to England on extended leave. This he finally achieved on 2 March 1858 by direct application to Canning in Calcutta, writing that Theo had been guilty of 'wholesale slaughters'.<sup>21</sup> By April he was able to report that, 'I stopped the different civil officers hanging at their own will and pleasure, and appointed a commission, since when matters have greatly improved and confidence among the natives greatly increased. It was most unfortunate Metcalfe being in power at Delhi,' he added. 'He did a great deal of harm. He has however now gone home.'\* 22

In the same letter Lawrence described how he had begun pressing for a general amnesty for anyone who had not personally murdered British civilians in cold blood. It was an idea he later took up with Canning: some of the British, he argued, were acting as if they were now engaged in 'a war of extermination'. Instead he recommended a complete amnesty, as 'so long as all [mutineers] are classed under one head, all will hold together and

resist to the death'. A perhaps unexpected supporter of Lawrence's plan turned out to to be Disraeli, who was deeply shocked by the British bloodlust that the Uprising had triggered: 'I protest against meeting atrocities with atrocities,' he told the House of Commons. 'I have seen things said, and seen written of late, which would make me suppose that … instead of bowing before the name of Jesus we were preparing to revive the worship of Moloch.'<sup>23</sup>

The idea of a general amnesty eventually became official policy, and was proclaimed in Queen Victoria's name on 1 November 1858. At the same time, in the Act for the Better Government of India, the British Crown finally assumed all governmental responsibilities held by the East India Company, and its 24,000-man military force was incorporated into the British Army. If Hindustan was to lose the Mughals, its rulers of nearly three hundred years' standing, it would at least now be ruled by a properly constituted colonial government rather than a rapacious multinational acting at least partly in the interests of its shareholders.\*

Saving Delhi, and limiting the amount of house clearance carried out, took a more prolonged campaign. As late as 1863, Saunders' replacement as Commissioner for Delhi was arguing that 'the citizens of the rebellious City of Delhi, as a body, had entirely forfeited their rights' by joining the Uprising. 'It must not be forgotten', he argued, 'that the citizens of Delhi joined hand in hand with the Mutineers.'<sup>24</sup> Lawrence, however, used his influence to drastically scale back the planned demolitions, arguing that Delhi 'is a position of great importance and should be held by us'. He also pointed out, unfashionably at the time, that 'We have been almost as much to blame for what occurred as have the people. I have yet neither seen nor heard anything to make me believe any conspiracy existed beyond the army, and even in it one can scarcely say there was a conspiracy … The army had for a long time been in an unsatisfactory state.'<sup>25</sup>

Canning had already given orders to destroy the Delhi walls and defences, but Lawrence managed to get the orders rescinded, arguing that there was insufficient gunpowder in Delhi to blow up several miles of walls.<sup>26</sup> By the end of 1859, Canning had agreed to his plan only to demolish what was needed to make the Fort and city more easily defensible. By 1863, the planned demolition of the eastern half of Chandni Chowk down to the Dariba had also been stopped.<sup>27</sup> Even so, great swathes of the

city – especially around the Red Fort – were still cleared away, as Ghalib recorded in a series of sad letters to his correspondents across Hindustan: 'The area between Raj Ghat [on the city's eastern edge, facing on to the Yamuna] and the Jama Masjid is without exaggeration a great mound of bricks.'

The Raj Ghat Gate has been filled in. Only the niched battlement of the walls is apparent. The rest has been filled up with debris. For the preparation of the metalled road, a wide open ground has been made between Calcutta Gate and the Kabul Gate. Punjabi Katra, Dhobiwara, Ramji Ganj, Sadat Khan ka Katra, the Haveli of Mubarak Begum [Ochterlony's widow], the Haveli of Sahib Ram and his garden – all have been destroyed beyond recognition.<sup>28</sup>

Other letters of Ghalib mourned the destruction of some of the city's finest mosques, such as the Akbarabadi Masjid and the Masjid Kashmiri Katra; great Sufi shrines such as that of Sheikh Kalimullah Jahanabadi;\* the imambara † built by Maulvi Muhammad Baqar; the *muhalla* of Bulaqi Begum; the main gate of the Dariba; and the establishment of a cleared open space 70 yards wide around the Jama Masjid.<sup>29</sup> Four of Delhi's most magnificent palaces were also completely destroyed: the havelis of the recently hanged nawabs of Jhajjar, Bahadurgarh and Farrucknagar, as well as that of the Raja of Ballabgarh.<sup>30</sup> The great caravanserai of Shah Jahan's daughter Jahanara was demolished and replaced by a new town hall. Shalimar Bagh, where Aurangzeb had been crowned, was sold off for agricultural use. Even where old Mughal structures were allowed to continue, they were often renamed: Begum Bagh, for example, became the Queen's Gardens.

Tragically, the Red Fort was another area where Lawrence intervened too late to stop the wholesale destruction. He managed to save both the Jama Masjid and the Palace walls, arguing that they would serve the British as well as the Mughals, but 80 per cent of the rest of the Fort was levelled. Harriet Tytler, who was living in an apartment above the Diwan i-Am at this time, was horrified by the decision and decided to paint a panorama of the city before it disappeared.\* It confirmed her in her disgust at the way the British had behaved in Delhi since the assault began on 14 September. 'Delhi was now truly a city of the dead,' she wrote in her memoirs. 'The

death-like silence of that Delhi was appalling. All you could see were empty houses … The utter stillness … [was] indescribably sad. It seemed as if something had gone out of our lives.'<sup>31</sup>

The demolitions started at the Queen's Baths in November 1857, and continued through most of the Palace, destroying an area 'twice the area of the Escorial', as the horrified architectural historian James Fergusson pointed out twenty years later. 'The whole of the area between the central range of the buildings south and eastwards from the bazaar, measuring about 1000 feet each way, was occupied by the harem apartments of the palace – twice the area of any Palace in Europe.'

According to the native plan I possess, which I see no reason for distrusting, it contained three garden courts, and some thirteen or fourteen other courts, arranged some for state, some for convenience; but what they were like we have no means of knowing. Not one vestige of them now remains … The whole of the harem courts of the palace were swept off the face of the earth to make way for a hideous British barrack, without those who carried out this fearful piece of vandalism, thinking it even worthwhile to make a plan of what they were destroying or preserving any record of the most splendid palace in the world.<sup>32</sup>

As late as March 1859 George Wagentrieber was pleased to record in the *Delhi Gazette* that 'a good deal of blowing up' was still going on in the Palace. Some of the finest buildings were the first to go, such as the Chhota Rang Mahal. Even the Fort's glorious gardens – notably Hayat Bakhsh Bagh and Mehtab Bagh – were swept away. All that was left by the end of the year was about one fifth of the original fabric – principally a few scattered, isolated marble buildings strung out along the Yamuna waterfront. These were saved owing largely to the fact than they were in use as offices and messes by the British occupation troops, but their architectural logic was completely lost once they were shorn of the courtyards of which they were originally a part.

All the gilded domes and most of the detachable marble fittings were stripped and sold off by the prize agents. As Fergusson noted,

when we took possession of the palace, everyone seems to have looted after the most independent fashion. Among others, a Captain (afterwards Sir) John Jones [who had blown in the Lahore Gate during the capture of the fort] tore up a great part, but had the happy idea to get his loot set in marble as table tops. Two of these he brought home and sold to the Government for £500, and were placed in the India Museum.<sup>33</sup>

These fragments included the rightly celebrated 'Orpheus panel' of *pietra dura* inlay which Shah Jahan had placed behind his Peacock Throne.

Meanwhile, what remained of the Mughal's Red Fort became a grey British barracks. The Naqqar Khana, where drums and trumpets had once announced the arrival of ambassadors from Isfahan and Constantinople, became the quarters of a British staff sergeant. The Diwan i-Am became a lounge for officers, the Emperor's private entrance a canteen, and the Rang Mahal an officers' mess. The Mumtaz Mahal was turned into a military prison. The magnificent Lahore Darwaza was renamed the Victoria Gate and became 'a bazaar for the benefit of the Fort's European soldiers'. Zafar's contribution to the Palace architecture – the Zafar Mahal, a delicate floating pavilion in a large red sandstone tank – became the centrepiece of a swimming pool for officers, while the surviving pavilions of Hay at Bakhsh Bagh were turned into urinals.<sup>34</sup>

While all this was going on, throughout 1858, Hindus were slowly being readmitted to the city, but Muslims remained almost entirely banned from within the walls. As Ghalib wrote in *Dastanbuy*,

In the entire city of Delhi it is impossible to find one thousand Muslims; and I am one of these. Some have gone so far from the city it seems as if they were never residents of Delhi. Many very important men are living outside the city, on ridges and under thatched roofs, in ditches and mud huts. Among those people living in the wilderness are many who are anxious to return to Delhi, relatives of the imprisoned, and those living on alms.<sup>35</sup>

A passing traveller in 1860 was horrified by 'the old withered *Musulmanis* and gypsy-like Mughals [still] camping out at the Qutb'. Even the

imperious Matilda Saunders was aware that 'numbers of people are daily dying of starvation and want of shelter'.<sup>36</sup>

In December 1859 the Muslims of Delhi petitioned the government to be allowed to return to their houses. They wrote to Queen Victoria praying (according to the translation commissioned by Charles Saunders)

That they may be permitted to return to their houses in the city of Delhi. They are in the greatest distress, excluded rigorously from the town, they can obtain neither shelter nor means of subsistence. The cold weather is now at hand and they beg that they may not be exposed to its severity in their present state of destitution and misery. They trust that Her Majesty following the example of other magnanimous sovereigns, would pardon their misdeeds and permit them to reinhabit their old houses – otherwise they see nothing but beggary before them.<sup>37</sup>

Even when their plea was granted and they began to be given permission to return in 1860, many Muslims who could not prove their loyalty found that their houses had been confiscated. Things got so bad that even some of the British papers in India began to feel sympathy with the Delhi Muslims: 'When will agitation of European nerves subside?' asked the *Mofussilite* in June 1860. 'There is no reason for it …'

The people are abject because they are starved out, banished and plundered. Thousands of Muslims are wandering houseless and homeless; the Hindus, pluming themselves on their assumed loyalty, strut about the streets giving themselves airs. Let not the public think that Delhi has not been punished. Wend through the empty grass-grown streets, mark the uprooted houses, and shotriddled palaces.<sup>38</sup>

Most of the confiscated Muslim properties put up for auction by the British were bought en masse by the Hindu *khatri* (clerical caste) and Jain bankers of the city, such as Chhunna Mal and Ramji Das. These were the only Delhiwallahs who still had access to liquid cash, their main centre of Nil ka Katra having bought immunity from the depredations of the prize agents on

the payment of a large sum soon after the fall of the city. <sup>39</sup> Hindu traders and bankers even bought up two of the city's most famous mosques: Chhunna Mal bought the Fatehpuri Masjid, while a Hindu baker bought the beautiful Zinat ul-Masajid, one of the main jihadi centres throughout the Uprising.\* 40

All this exacerbated the sudden shift of power from the Muslim elite, who had dominated the city before the Uprising, to the Hindu bankers, who were its most wealthy citizens afterwards. 'The capital is in the hands of one or two men like Chhunna Mal and Mahesh Das,' wrote Edward Campbell in 1858.<sup>41</sup> What remained of the court circle and the Mughal aristocracy were by and large left penniless. A few survived on a pittance as schoolteachers and tutors. For many, such as Maulvi Zaka'ullah, the shock of the utter devastation of their world was 'beyond all bearing', and Zaka'ullah later admitted that for a time he had succumbed to 'a melancholy that bordered on blank despair'.<sup>42</sup>

'Alas my dear boy,' wrote Ghalib to a friend in January 1862. 'This is not the Delhi in which you were born, not the Delhi in which you got your schooling, not the Delhi in which you used to come to your lessons with me, not the Delhi in which I have passed fifty-one years of my life.'

It is a camp. The only Muslims here are artisans or servants of the British authorities. All the rest are Hindus. The male descendants of the deposed King – such as survived the sword – draw allowances of five rupees a month. The female descendants, if old, are bawds; if young, are prostitutes …<sup>43</sup>

What Ghalib did not say was that many of the Delhi begums were set on the path to prostitution by the mass rapes that followed the fall of the city. Believing that the British women in Delhi had been sexually assaulted at the outbreak – a rumour that subsequently proved quite false, as a full inquiry commissioned by Saunders later proved – British officers did little to stop their men from raping the women of Delhi. At the same time as Saunders' inquiry completely exonerated the rebels of any single instance of rape, another inquiry found that perhaps as many as three hundred begums of the royal house – not including former concubines in the Palace – had been 'taken away by our troops after the fall of Delhi', and that many

of those who had not been abducted were now making their livings as courtesans.<sup>44</sup> The fate of the women of the royal family was clearly something that deeply shocked Ghalib, and he returns to it again and again in his letters: 'Had you been here,' he told his friend Mirza Tafta, 'you would have seen the ladies of the Fort moving about the city, their faces as fair as the moon and their clothes dirty, their paijama legs torn, and their slippers falling to pieces. This is no exaggeration …'<sup>45</sup>

With the loss of the Mughal court went much of the city's reputation as a centre of culture and learning. Its libraries had been looted, its precious manuscripts lost. The madrasas were almost all closed, and their buildings were again mostly bought up – and in time demolished – by Hindu moneylenders. The most prestigious of all, the Madrasa i-Rahimiyya was auctioned off to one of the leading *baniyas*, Ramji Das, who used it as a store.<sup>46</sup>

By 1859 Ghalib was complaining that he could not even find a single bookseller, binder or calligrapher in this once most bookish of cities.<sup>47</sup> Still less were there any poets: 'Where is Mamnun? Where is Zauq? And where is Momin Khan? Two poets survive. One, Azurda – and he is silent: the other Ghalib, and he is lost in himself, in a stupor. None to write poetry, and none to judge its worth.' To make matters worse for Ghalib, much of his own verse – his life's great achievement – had been lost: he had never kept copies of his ghazals and the two private libraries in which his friends had stored his poetry had both been sacked and destroyed by the British. 'A few days ago a faqir who has a good voice and sings well discovered a ghazal of mine somewhere and got it written down,' he wrote in one letter. 'When he showed it to me, I tell you truly, tears came to my eyes.'<sup>48</sup>

'This whole city has become a desert,' wrote a melancholy Ghalib to a friend in 1861. 'Delhi people still pride themselves on Delhi language! What pathetic faith! My dear man, when the Urdu Bazaar is no more, where is Urdu? By God, Delhi is no more a city, but a camp, a cantonment. No Fort, no bazaars, no watercourses …'<sup>49</sup> 'Four things kept Delhi alive,' he wrote to another friend who enquired what Delhi was like these days. 'The Fort, the daily crowds at the Jama Masjid, the weekly walk to the Yamuna Bridge, and the yearly fair of the flower-men. None of these survives, so how could Delhi survive? Yes, there was once a city of that name in the realm of India.'<sup>50</sup>

In such a situation Ghalib often wondered what the point of carrying on was when everything he had lived for was finished. 'A man cannot quench his thirst with tears,' he wrote. 'You know that when despair reaches its lowest depths, there is nothing left but to resign oneself to God's will. What lower depths can there be than this: that it is the hope of death that keeps me alive?'<sup>51</sup> 'My soul', he wrote in June 1862, 'dwells in my body these days as restless as a bird in a cage.'<sup>52</sup>

Without the Delhi College and the great madrasas, without the printing presses and the Urdu newspapers, and without the Mughal court – whose immense cultural prestige always compensated for the monetary constrictions on its actual powers of patronage – and most of all without the Emperor there to act as a focus and, to some extent, catalyst, the driving force behind Delhi's renaissance and artistic flourishing was gone. The beating heart of Indo-Islamic civilisation had been ripped out, and could not be replaced. As Ghalib wrote as he neared death: 'All these things lasted only so long as the King reigned.'<sup>53</sup>

On 1 April 1859, Edward Ommaney said farewell to Zafar and his family, and set off back to India with his regiment; with him went four more of Zafar's Indian attendants who had found themselves homesick in Burma and wished to return to their families in India.

Three weeks later, Zafar was moved a short distance through the cantonment to his new quarters, half a mile below the Shwe Dagon Pagoda.<sup>54</sup> 'The house is situated within a few yards of the Main Guard, & like wooden houses of the country is considerably raised off the ground,' reported Zafar's new jailer, Captain Nelson Davies. 'It is in an enclosure 100 ft square, and is surrounded by palisading 10 ft high.'

The accommodation consists of four rooms each 16 feet square, one of which is allotted for the use of the ex-King, another for Jawan Bukht and his young Begum, a third is appropriated by the Begum

Zinat Mahal. To each of these rooms a bathing area is attached. Shah Abbas and his mother occupy the remaining room.

The attendants either lounge about the verandahs or put up underneath the house, which is covered by pounded brick to keep the place dry. A drain all around the house also contributes to this object. There are two bathrooms & a double necessary for the use of the servants, also a place to cook in.

The verandahs in the upper storeys of the house are surrounded with chicks battened down. Here the old and enfeebled ex-King & his sons generally sit, and as the floor of the upper storey is raised nearly to the level of the pallisading, they enjoy the benefit of the prevailing sea breeze, and also an extended and cheerful view. Watching the passers by, & gazing at the shipping, somewhat relieves the monotony of their prison life, & reconciles them in some measure to their present quarter.

Davies went on to describe the security arrangements for the guarding of the royal family: 'Two sentries mount guard by day, usually three at night.' The prisoners were visited and checked twice a day. As for the cost of feeding the Emperor and his family, it 'greatly exceeds here what it would be in India, averaging about 11 Rs a day, and as provisions are rising in price it is probable that the daily expenditure will exceed that amount. Since I have taken charge, an extra rupee is allowed to them every Sunday', continued the magnanimous Davies, 'and on the first of each month, 2 Rs extra'.

This allows them to indulge in a few articles for the toilet without the necessity of asking me for every trifle in a way they may require. Pen, ink, paper are of course strictly forbidden. Previous to my taking charge they had supplied themselves with many little necessaries they required, and also their entire wearing apparel, from their own resources, but now they state that all their funds are expended, an assertion which may admit of some doubts. I daily ascertain both by personal inspection & enquiry that the food supplied them is sufficient and good. A supply of clothes has recently been provided, but their old stock being in a very

dilapidated state, I shall presently be obliged to replenish it still further.

The establishment kept up for the prisoners is on the lowest possible scale, and consists of one Chupprassie whose business it is to procure their daily supplies, & he is a sort of confidential agent between myself and them. The man I at present have is a Burman but speaks Hindoostanee sufficiently well to receive orders from the prisoners regarding their bazaar requirements. His pay is rather higher than what I could get a Hindoostanee man for, but I thought it advisable to employ a man of a different race, where such constant intercourse was required.

The only other servants employed are a *bheestie* [water carrier], *dhoby* [washerman] & sweeper. These are necessarily Hindostanee men, but they are all attached to my service & as I oblige them all to live in my compound which is next to the prisoners, I thus have them constantly at hand & can also keep a close supervision over them. The public are of course not allowed to hold intercourse with the prisoners, & the servants can only gain admission under a pass from myself which is issued daily and must be inspected by the officer on main guard ere they gain admission. For better security these tickets are printed and checked by a system of numbering in addition to every signature.

Davies went on to discuss Zafar's health, which he described as 'tolerably good … since his removal from the former confined quarters, his heath has considerably improved, and although much enfeebled, yet he is not more so than might be expected from a native of India at the advanced age of 86'.

His memory is still good, when time is allowed him to fix his ideas, but his articulation is indistinct consequent on the loss of his teeth. He certainly now does not give the impression of being capable of any extended mental energy or capacity, but on the whole he appears to bear his weight of years remarkably well. He passes his days in listless apathy, manifesting considerable indifference to all but eternal affairs. This apparently has been his normal state for a long time past, and may continue so for some time to come, until all

of a sudden his career may come to a close, without taking anyone by surprise.

Davies was not able to see Zinat Mahal, who remained in pardah, but he sent in his wife to report back. She 'is described by Mrs Davies, who occasionally visits both the Begums, as a middle-aged woman'.

She enjoys very good health. I have had several conversations with her from behind the screen. She frequently enlarges on the step she took at the time of the outbreak at Delhi in writing to the late Mr Colvin, the Lt Gov of NW Provinces [at Agra], begging him to come to her assistance implying thereby that at the time the Royal Family were at the mercy of the Rebels, & she constantly avers that they were thus helpless even to protect the unfortunate European girl who sought her protection.

She also frequently alludes to the loss of her private treasure and jewels, & states that Major Hodson pledged his word and gave her a written document as security for the safety of her personal property. I am unacquainted with the exact particulars, but I consider it as well to relate the Begum's version of this circumstance. She states that her property was not disturbed until after Major Hodson's death, when she was required to give up the document he had given her as a protection. She was then dispossessed by Mr Saunders, the Commissioner at Delhi, of all her valuables to the extent of 20 lakhs (£200,000) in value, and he refused to return her the document.

I have explained to her that on her husband being convicted of Rebellion all the property of the family became escheated to the Government, that her establishment being distinct from that of the King's, and her residing in a separate Mahal, has nothing whatever to do with it. She seemed however to think that the sequestration of her personal property is somewhat contrary to custom. However I gave her no hopes of ever being placed in a position by the possession of wealth to work the mischief her talents might render possible, were she so inclined, for she appears to be a woman of a masculine turn of mind judging from her conversations and deportment. Of the two, she most probably had more to say to the intrigues of the rebels than her imbecile husband.\*

Davies then revealed the degree to which both Zafar and Zinat Mahal blamed their situation on their former confidant, personal doctor and prime minister, Hakim Ahsanullah Khan. According to several eyewitnesses, including the usually impeccably reliable Zahir Dehlavi, it was the hakim who had pressed Zafar to stop blocking the rebels' attempts to murder the European prisoners in the Fort; but while presiding over the massacre was one of the principal charges levelled against Zafar, the hakim had got off without hanging or even imprisonment in return for standing up in court and giving evidence against his former employer. 'The statement of prisoners must of course always be received with caution,' wrote Davies,

but in connection with the loss of her treasure, a certain person named Azam Oollah Khan appears to have had a hand – at least all the prisoners are very bitter against him, & assert that this individual, who was the King's hakeem and advisor, was the principal person through whose insidious counsel the destruction of the European prisoners was brought about. This is, I believe, contrary to fact,† but it is not impossible this man may have given some information regarding the secreted treasure & this incurred the enmity of the Queen's party. However this may be, this hakeem from the account appears to have gained the confidence of the British authorities in Delhi, no doubt with good and sufficient reason, & the spleen displayed by the Begum, & her associates, only adds to confirm this opinion.

Davies then turned his attention to Shah Zamani Begum, whom he describes – presumably again second-hand through the descriptions provided by his wife – as

a young and pretty woman, probably not more than 15 years old, although she has already been the mother of two children. She appears to feel the restraint of prison life rather more than the others. This may partially be the result of a delicate state of health consequent on her accouchement, which took place shortly after her arrival here. The child, I understand from Lt Ommaney, was a male one and was still born. Both the old King and his daughter in law are particularly fond of soliciting the services of the doctor upon

every trifling occasion, and the young lady is very solicitous of being allowed to go out for an airing occasionally.

As for Mirzas Jawan Bakht and Shah Abbas,

The two sons are both healthy and rather promising youths, different somewhat in bearing and manner. The elder, Jawan Bakht, exhibits an appearance and deportment of superiority. This is produced probably more from his present recognised position in the family, rather than from any decided superiority in his character and attainments, he having been born a Prince, whereas his less fortunate half-brother is but the son of a handmaiden. Both are extremely ignorant, the attainments of the elder embracing merely a slight knowledge of reading & writing in the Persian character, & when interrogated on the most ordinary topics, their want of knowledge is very apparent. Even the boundaries of their native country are wholly unknown to them.

I feel it my duty as the only medium by which their wishes can be heard, to record for the information of the Government the very laudable desire both these lads exhibit to learn. They have frequently expressed a very earnest wish to acquire a knowledge of the English language in particular, & they seem to be fully aware that by so doing they will have adopted the very last course for removing the misfortune if not disgrace attendant on their present state of ignorance, and they state they expressed a wish to the Commissioner of Delhi to be sent to England in preference to any other place. Both the parents of the lads have talked to me on the subject, & all appear anxious that a commencement should be made. The lads are possessed of sufficient intelligence to warrant a hope of speedy progress and have promised me earnestly to apply themselves if the Government permits the scheme to be undertaken. I told them I would communicate their wishes for the consideration of the Government.

In the covering letter, Davies enlarged on his hopes for the two boys, suggesting that by sending the two princes to England they could create a pair of Anglicised and Anglophile Mughal princes. Davies also added that

Zafar and Zinat Mahal had both given their blessing to this plan: 'I have studiously avoided giving the lads any encouragement to expect Government will interfere on their behalf,' he wrote. 'But as the sands of their father's life are running out apace, some change in the circumstances and position of the two youths may at no very distant period become a possibility.'

In such a case it will not be denied that the cultivation of their present desire for acquiring European instruction, would afford moral and also political advantages of no slight moment. It opens out the readiness, perhaps the only method of in a measure denationalising them, and thus bringing about a result so eminently advantageous, as an assimilation of the latent, but mutual hopes … between the heirs and the subjects of a dynasty subjected by a foreign power.

Both the parents of the lads have talked to me on the subject, and all appear anxious that the work should at once commence …

Such a conclusion on their part seems to offer a favourable opportunity for completing that severance between them and their countrymen before alluded to as a desirable result, and which would be vastly facilitated by entirely removing them from the narrow world of Indian life, with all its prejudices and absurdities. And the benefit of such a change, acting on a useful mind, has always been satisfactorily exemplified in the case of Maharajah Duleep Singh;\* and at present these boys are just of an age when good impressions are easily formed and natural talents cultivated, when precepts can with little difficulty be inculcated, and inherent vices uprooted, when a knowledge that morality is indispensable to real happiness might be caused to work in them for good, and the practical application of that morality might be so cultivated as to become habitual.

It cannot be overlooked that a time is at hand when these imprisoned youths will arrive at maturity, and those who are in authority over them have it in their power to give a definite direction to their future. Is there then no responsibility attached to such a position?

The first and most essential requisite therefore is to give the lads breathing room and to separate them completely from the baneful atmosphere of bigotry, superstitious ignorance and consequent degradation by which they are at present surrounded, their only companions being menials, to whom the blessings of education and morality are alike unknown – the very scum of a reduced Asiatic haram.

Davies concluded his letter by writing a little more about Zafar's attendants who had chosen to stay in exile and imprisonment with him. This quite remarkable display of loyalty cut no ice with Davies.

With regard to the attendants all I can say is that they are a low set, dirty in their habits, & much inferior to the ordinary class of domestics in an officer's household. The only exception is perhaps Ahmed Beg. He seems to be a respectable old man, & could have no motive for attending the ex-King other than fidelity. With the Begum's attendant, Abdool Rahman, the case is somewhat different. He is a low, cunning fellow, & I am not quite satisfied as to what relationship he stands in towards the Queen, whether attendant, or something more.<sup>55</sup>

Davies's idea that the princes could be sent to England was promptly and peremptorily turned down by his superiors in Calcutta, who forbade him in future from 'introducing into his letters and diaries the mention of trivial matters which it does not concern the Government to know'.<sup>56</sup> Davies was also ticked off for using 'such expressions as "the ex-King" "the ex-Royal Family" "the Begum". The Governor General in Council requests that Captain Davies may be directed to avoid these expressions in future'. He was directed to refer merely to 'the Delhi State Prisoners'.<sup>57</sup>

Banned from leaving their confinement in Rangoon, and now of no interest to the British government in Calcutta, the two boys now had no choice but to look to Davies for their education. They continued to visit his house 'pretty regularly', and were said to be making 'excellent progress' in English, though Davies admitted he found 'it difficult to invent anything to break the monotony of their existence …'

They occasionally come over and converse with Mrs Davies and communicate their bitter woes … Shah Abbas gives more attention and is consequently ahead. Jawan Bakht's disposition appears more averse to Europeans than his brother who, in the absence of better opportunities, converses occasionally with the European soldiers of the guard.<sup>58</sup>

Other letters also hinted at Jawan Bakht's growing disaffection. 'Shah Abbas has the sense to see the necessity of rules,' wrote Davies,

and submits to it cheerfully and generally extends his walk every morning to the gardens with a sentry. But Jawan Bakht, perhaps thinking the arrangements somewhat retrograde declines to go out at all, and has taken no exercise in the last two months. This obstinacy, if persisted in, would not be good for his health. But I have little doubt that he will be in a better mood in time.<sup>59</sup>

Zafar, meanwhile, sat silently watching the passing shipping from his Rangoon balcony. He was allowed no pen and paper, so his own reaction to his isolation and exile can only be guessed at. Certainly it now seems as if the famous verses attributed to him in exile, expressing his sadness and bitterness, are not the product of his own hand, though William Howard Russell explicitly described him writing verses on the walls of his prison with a burned stick, and it is not completely impossible that these could somehow have been recorded and preserved.\*

![](_page_24_Picture_4.jpeg)

By 1862, Zafar had reached the grand old age of eighty-seven. Even though he was weak and feeble, and although doctors had now been expecting his imminent demise for some two decades, he still showed no signs of succumbing to their predictions, beyond 'feeling ill with paralysis at the root of the tongue'.<sup>60</sup>

In late October 1862, however, at the end of the monsoon, Zafar's condition became suddenly much worse: he was unable to swallow or keep down his food, and Davies wrote in his diary that the tenure of his life was now 'very uncertain'. The old man was spoon-fed on broth, but by 3 November found it increasingly difficult to get even that down. On the 5th, Davies wrote that 'the Civil Surgeon does not think Abu Zafar can survive many days'. The following day, Davies reported that the old man 'is evidently sinking from pure decrepitude and paralysis in the region of his throat'. In preparation for the death, Davies ordered that bricks and lime be collected, and a secluded spot at the back of Zafar's enclosure was prepared for the burial.

After a long night's struggle, Zafar finally breathed his last at 5 a.m. on the morning of Friday, 7 November 1862. Immediately the machinery of the Empire swung into action to make sure that the passing of the Last Mughal would be as discreet and uneventful as possible. Zafar's death may have marked the end of a great ruling dynasty 350 years old, but Davies was determined that as few as possible would witness this sad and historic moment. 'All things being in readiness,' wrote Davies, 'he was buried at 4 p.m. on the same day at the rear of the Main Guard in a brick grave, covered over with turf level with the ground.' Davies noted how his two boys and their father's manservant attended the burial, but the women, in accordance with Muslim custom, did not.

'A bamboo fence surrounds the grave for some considerable distance,' he concluded, 'and by the time the fence is worn out, the grass will again have properly covered the spot, and no vestige will remain to distinguish where the last of the Great Moghuls rests.'

The following day, Davies wrote his official report on the demise of his charge. 'This event made very little impression either on the relatives or on the Mahomedan population of this town,' Davies noted with satisfaction. 'Probably about a couple of hundred spectators assembled at the time of the funeral, but this event was occasioned in a great extent by idlers coming from the neighbouring Sudder Bazar to town to see the Races which were going on that afternoon near the prisoners' quarters.'<sup>61</sup>

'The death of the ex-King may be said to have had no effect on the Mahomedan part of the populace of Rangoon,' he added, 'except perhaps for a few fanatics who watch and pray for the final triumph of Islam.'

![](_page_26_Picture_0.jpeg)

News of Zafar's death reached Delhi a fortnight later on 20 November. Ghalib read the news in the *Avadh Akhbar*, the same day that it was announced that the Jama Masjid was finally going to be given back to the Muslims of Delhi. Already numbed by the news of so many other deaths and tragedies, Ghalib's reaction was resigned and muted: On Friday the 7th November, and the 14th Jamadu ul Awwal, Abu Zafar Siraj ud Din Bahadur Shah was freed from the bonds of the foreigner and the bonds of the flesh. "Verily we are for God, and verily to him we shall return."'<sup>62</sup>

Ghalib's reaction was typical. No newspaper, British or Indian, carried the news of Zafar's death in any detail. There had been so much bloodshed, and so many funerals, and to some extent Zafar had already been mourned, and then forgotten: after all, it was now five years since he had been banished from the city and sent into Burmese exile.

It was only gradually, with the distance of hindsight, that the scale of the vacuum left by the destruction and dispersal of Zafar's court became apparent. The dramatic way in which both Hindus and Muslims had rallied to the Mughal capital at the outbreak of the Uprising had demonstrated the degree to which the mystique of the dynasty was still very much alive more than a century after the Mughals had ceased to exercise any real political, economic or military power. Contrary to all expectations, the idea of the Mughal Emperor as the divinely ordained *axis mundi*, the universal sovereign, and *Padshah*, Lord of the World, still had resonance across Hindustan at this time. Even more surprisingly, and contrary to many modern assumptions, it clearly resonated as strongly for Hindus as it did for Muslims. As Mark Thornhill had written, sitting in Mathura shortly after the sepoys arrived from Meerut, listening to his office staff excitedly discuss the revival of the Mughal throne:

Their talk was all about the ceremonial of the palace and how it would be revived. They speculated as to who would be Grand Chamberlain, which of the chiefs of Rajpootana would guard the different gates, and who were the fifty-two Rajahs who would

assemble to put the Emperor on the throne … As I listened I realised as I never had done before the deep impression that the splendour of the ancient court had made on the popular imagination, how dear to them were the traditions and how faithfully, all unknown to us, they had preserved them.<sup>63</sup>

The outbreak revealed the surprising degree to which the Mughal court was still regarded across northern India not as some sort of foreign Muslim imposition – as some, especially on the Hindu right wing, look upon the Mughals today – but instead as the principal source of political legitimacy, and therefore the natural centre of resistance against British colonial rule.\*

Nevertheless, if the outbreak demonstrated the power of the Mughal name, the disastrous course of the Uprising dramatically highlighted the shortcomings and impotence of that Old Mughal feudal order. Zafar may have commanded the nominal loyalty and allegiance of the sepoys and his people, but that loyalty did not stretch to either direct obedience or submission, especially when his treasury was shown to be empty, and the weakness of Zafar's personal authority became apparent. The crucial failure to get even the hinterland of Delhi to submit to Zafar's rule, or to organise a proper logistical apparatus to feed the troops gathered within the walls, meant that the massive – and largely Hindu – army that collected so quickly and strikingly at Delhi soon ran out of food, and before long was brought to the edge of starvation. For this reason it was already well on the way to dispersing long before the British entered the Kashmiri Gate to deliver the *coup de grâce*.

When Delhi fell in September 1857 it was not just the city and Zafar's court which were uprooted and destroyed, but the self-confidence and authority of the wider Mughal political and cultural world throughout India. The scale of the devastation and defeat, and the depths of the humiliation heaped on the vanquished Mughals, profoundly diminished not just the prestige of the old aristocratic order, but also – to at least some extent – the composite Hindu-Muslim, Indo-Islamic civilisation of which Zafar's court had been the flagship, and of whose sophisticated, tolerant and openminded attitudes Ghalib's poems still form such a striking testament.

For the British after 1857, the Indian Muslim became an almost subhuman creature, to be classified in unembarrassedly racist imperial literature alongside such other despised and subject specimens, such as Irish

Catholics or 'the Wandering Jew'. The depth to which Indian Muslims had sunk in British eyes is visible in an 1868 production called *The People of India*, which contains photographs of the different castes and tribes of South Asia ranging from Tibetans and Aboriginals (illustrated with a picture of a naked tribal) to the Doms of Bihar. The image of 'the Mahomedan' is illustrated by a picture of an Aligarh labourer who is given the following caption: 'His features are peculiarly Mahomedan … [and] exemplify in a strong manner the obstinacy, sensuality, ignorance and bigotry of his class. It is hardly possible, perhaps, to conceive features more essentially repulsive.'<sup>64</sup>

The profound contempt that the British so openly expressed for Indian Muslim and Mughal culture proved contagious, particularly to the ascendant Hindus, who quickly hardened their attitudes to all things Islamic, but also to many young Muslims, who now believed than their own ancient and much-cherished civilisation had been irretrievably discredited. Some even shared Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan's initial conviction that Indian Muslims could never again prosper or 'receive esteem'. 'For some time,' he wrote, 'I could not even bear to contemplate the miserable state of my people. I wrestled with my grief, and believe me it made an old man of me.'<sup>65</sup>

Just as the amateurish Mughal-led armies had proved unable to compete with British generals and British Enfields, and just as Mirza Mughal's stumbling commissariat proved no match for the Company's bureaucracy, so in the years that followed the still-living and even thriving Mughal miniature and architectural tradition would soon come to a grinding halt in the face of Tropical Gothic colonial architecture and other Victorian art forms. The elaborate politeness of Mughal etiquette and Indo-Islamic manners came to be regarded merely as anachronistic. The poetic world represented by Zafar's *mushairas* would find it increasingly hard to attract young Indian intellectuals seduced by the siren call of Tennyson or the Wordsworthian naturalism now taught in English-medium schools.<sup>66</sup> As Maulvi Muhammad Baqar's son, the poet and critic Azad, wrote: 'The important thing is that the glory of the winners' ascendant fortune gives everything of theirs – even their dress, their gait, their conversation – a radiance that makes them desirable. And people do not merely adopt them, but they are proud to adopt them.'<sup>67</sup>

Not all the changes, of course, were necessarily for the worse. The autocratic political structures of Mughal rule received a devastating death blow. Only ninety years separated the British victory at the gates of Delhi in 1857 from the British eviction from South Asia through the Gateway of India in 1947. But while memories of British atrocities in 1857 may have assisted in the birth of Indian nationalism, as did the growing separation and mutual suspicion of rulers and ruled that followed the Uprising, it was not the few surviving descendants of the Mughals, nor any of the old princely and feudal rulers, who were in any way responsible for India's march to independence. Instead, the Indian freedom movement was led by the new Anglicised and educated Colonial Service class who emerged from Englishlanguage schools after 1857, and who by and large used modern Western democratic structures and methods – political parties, strikes and protest marches – to gain their freedom.

Even after Independence, the arts that were cultivated by the Mughals – the miniature painting tradition, the ghazal, the delicate forms of Mughal architecture – never really regained their full vitality or artistic prestige, and remained – at least in some quarters – as discredited as the emperors who patronised them.

Today, if you visit the old Mughal city of Agra, perhaps to see the Taj Mahal, the supreme architectural achievement of Mughal rule, note how the roundabouts are full of statues of the Rani of Jhansi, Shivaji and even Subhas Chandra Bose; but not one image of any Mughal emperor has been erected anywhere in the city since independence. Although a Bahadur Shah Zafar road still survives in Delhi, as indeed do roads named after all the other Great Mughals, for many Indians today, rightly or wrongly, the Mughals are still perceived as it suited the British to portray them in the imperial propaganda that they taught in Indian schools after 1857: as sensual, decadent, temple-destroying invaders – something that was forcefully and depressingly demonstrated by the whole episode of the demoliton of the Baburi Masjid at Ayodhya in 1992. The profoundly sophisticated, liberal and plural civilisation championed by Akbar, Dara Shukoh or the later Mughal emperors has only a limited resonance for the urban middle class in modern India. Many of these are now deeply ambivalent about the achievements of the Mughals, even if they will still happily eat a Mughal meal, or flock to the cinema to watch a Bollywood Mughal epic, or indeed head to the Red Fort to hear their Prime Minister

give the annual Independence Day speech from the battlements in front of the Lahore Gate.

As for Zafar, he remained the focus of much nostalgic sympathy, especially – though not exclusively – among Indian Muslims. But romantic longing for a lost empire was not enough to protect or preserve the Mughal culture he embodied. This was especially so given his equivocal attitude to the Uprising, only partly supporting it during its ascendancy, and then completely rejecting it in defeat. There was nothing left for his supporters to cling on to, not even a coherent political idea. With his death, followed seven years later by that of Ghalib, the self-esteem and confidence of an entire civilisation also passed away, so discredited it could never hope to be revived.

The same year that Ghalib died in Delhi, 1869, there was born in Porbandar in Gujarat a boy called Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. It would be with the political movements headed by Gandhi, rather than those represented by Zafar, or indeed by Lord Canning, that the future of India would lie.

![](_page_30_Picture_3.jpeg)

After the death of Zafar, what survived of the Mughal royal family quickly fell apart. As Captain Davies wrote in his next report to Calcutta, the Mughals were now, like the civilisation they represented,

A divided house … Begum Zeenat Mahul is a party in herself and until recently she and her son and Daughter in-law were in a deadly feud … Jawan Bukht and his wife form a second clique, and Shah Abbas his mother and grandmother are third. All three sections keep their premises distinct and cook and eat their meals separately and have little or no communication with each other. 68

As the years went on, things only got worse. In 1867 the family were allowed to leave the prison enclosure and to settle elsewhere in the Rangoon cantonment.69 But they were given such miserable allowances that

by 1870, eight years after the death of Zafar, the house that Jawan Bakht shared with his mother and Nawab Shah Zamani Begum was described as 'wretched … a mere hovel and much overcrowded'. As a young girl of no more than ten Shah Zamani Begum had paraded gloriously through the streets of Mughal Delhi on elephant-back to marry her Mirza Jawan Bakht. Now racked with disappointment at the way her life had turned out, she became 'seriously ill … suffering from extreme depression', and, to the alarm of the British officials who were meant to look after her, started to go blind.<sup>70</sup>

Jawan Bakht and his wife were given another house, not far from the Rangoon jail, in the hope that this would improve matters. But despite his poverty, Jawan Bakht still spent more than he could afford on drink, and a government official reported to Calcutta that his pension was 'scarcely sufficient to meet the actual requirements of the family …'

Whenever therefore Jawan Bakht commits the least extravagance, or falls into the slightest improvident indulgence, it is his wife and children who are the real and only sufferers. Shah Zamani Begum is the only completely innocent member of the Delhi family and yet has been the greatest sufferer of all. On more than one occasion this blind lady has been obliged to pawn her clothes and the few ornaments she has left, to procure food for herself and her children; whilst Jawan Bakht will drown any remorse he may feel in a fit of hard drinking … I am really powerless to interfere; any interference would only lead him to threaten his wife and treat her very harshly. 71

By 1872, Shah Zamani Begum was reported to be 'perfectly blind and helpless … The conduct of this lady has been exemplary; and her misfortunes, arising from no fault of her own, have been very great. Though Jawan Bakht's conduct has of late greatly improved, her absolute dependence on him must at times be very great and frequently very trying … She is an object of great pity'.<sup>72</sup>

Mirza Shah Abbas eventually married a girl from Rangoon – the daughter of a local Muslim merchant – and seems to have escaped some of the misery that struck down the rest of his family.\* Zinat Mahal,

meanwhile, lived on alone: 'in a very frugal almost penurious way … in a wooden house, purchased by herself, with two or three female servants … This widowed Begum has allowed her house to fall into great disrepair … She lives a quiet retired life and bears herself with some dignity … [though] the house she now occupies is a tumbledown, discreditable building, an eyesore to the locality in which it is situated'. In her old age, she applied to be allowed to return to India, saying she was being 'oppressed' by her son Jawan Bakht, but the application was summarily turned down.<sup>73</sup> Her one comfort and indulgence was opium, to which she became increasingly addicted towards the end of her life. She died in 1882, twenty years after her husband. By the time of her death, the exact place of Zafar's grave had already been forgotten and could not be located, so she was buried in a roughly similar position near a tree that was remembered to be near by. Two years later, Mirza Jawan Bakht had a severe stroke and followed her to the grave. He was aged only forty-two.

When a delegation of visitors from India came in 1903 to pay their respects at the burial place of Zafar, even the exact location of Zinat Mahal's grave had been forgotten, though some local guides pointed out the sight of the 'withered lotus tree'.<sup>74</sup> In 1905, however, there was a protest by the Muslims of Rangoon demanding that Zafar's grave should be marked, because, in the words of their application, 'the Mahommedan Community of Rangoon is agitated over the resting place of the last King of the proud line of the Mughals … As a man or as a King, Bahadur Shah was not to be admired, but he should be remembered'. They asked to be 'allowed by the government to purchase a strip of land enclosing the grave in question, of sufficient area to permit a monument worthy of Bahadur Shah being erected over it'.<sup>75</sup>

The initial British response was not favourable. The application was forwarded to Calcutta, where a reply was sent straight back to the effect that 'the Viceroy concurs in your view that it would be very inappropriate for the Government to do anything to perpetuate or to pay respect to the memory of Bahadur Shah, or to erect over his remains a tomb which might become a place of pilgrimage'<sup>76</sup>

Following a demonstration and a long series of newspaper articles, however, the British authorities finally agreed in 1907 to erect a 'simple engraved stone slab marked, Bahadur Shah, ex-King of Delhi. Died at

Rangoon November 7th 1862 and was buried near this spot'. A railing was also allowed around the supposed site of the grave, and according to the *Rangoon Times* of 26 August 1907, in due course a meeting was held at the Victoria Hall 'to record the sense of satisfaction among the Mahommedan community for the erection of the present memorial' and 'on account of the sympathetic and beneficent interest taken by the government in the matter'.77 A memorial stone to Zinat Mahal was added later the same year.

By 1925 the railing had become a makeshift shrine, covered with a roof of corrugated iron<sup>78</sup> Eighteen years later it was in the road beside this basic mazar (shrine) that the Japanese billeted the troops of the Indian National Army during the Second World War. It was unclear whether it was deliberate or not, but one of these groups, posted directly next to the shrine in what was now Theatre Road, was the Rani of Jhansi Brigade, named after another of the leaders of the 1857 Uprising, who partly inspired their ill-fated (and, in Nehru and Gandhi's view, wrong-headed) attempt to liberate India from British rule by joining hands with the invading Japanese.<sup>79</sup>

Then, in 1991, on 16 February, workmen digging a drain at the back of the shrine uncovered a brick-lined grave. It was 3 feet under the ground, and about 25 feet from the shrine. The skeleton of the Last Mughal was found quite intact within.

Today the brick grave of Bahadur Shah, now located in a sort of crypt below and to one side of the old shrine, is a popular place of pilgrimage for Rangoon's Muslim population. The local Muslims regard Zafar as a powerful Sufi saint, and come to seek his *barakat* (spiritual blessing) and ask for favours, all of which would no doubt have pleased him since he enjoyed taking on *murids* (Sufi disciples) when he was alive. Zafar also receives fairly regular visits from passing politicians from South Asia, and dignitaries from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh compete to shower the

grave with presents, the most generous of which is a large, though far from beautiful, carpet presented by Rajiv Gandhi.

Despite this, Zafar has few supporters in the modern history books. In some ways, it is true, his life can be seen as a study in failure: after all, he presided over the great collapse of Indo-Islamic civilisation, and his contribution to the Uprising of 1857 was hardly heroic. He is blamed by some nationalist historians for corresponding with the British during the fighting, and by others for failing to lead the rebels to victory. Yet it is difficult to see what more Zafar could have done, at least at the age of eighty-two. He was physically infirm, partially senile and had no money to pay the troops who flocked to his standard. Octogenarians can hardly lead a cavalry charge. Try as he might, he was powerless even to stop the looting of Delhi by an insurgent army that proved almost as much a threat to Zafar's subjects as it did to his enemies. Yet the Mutiny Papers bear eloquent witness to the energy he expended trying to protect his people and his city.

But while Zafar was certainly never cut out to be a heroic or revolutionary leader, he remains, like his ancestor the Emperor Akbar, an attractive symbol of Islamic civilisation at its most tolerant and pluralistic. He was himself a notable poet and calligrapher; his court contained some of the most talented artistic and literary figures in modern South Asian history; and the Delhi he presided over was undergoing one of its great periods of learning, self-confidence, communal amity and prosperity. He is certainly a strikingly liberal and likeable figure when compared to the Victorian Evangelicals whose insensitivity, arrogance and blindness did much to bring the Uprising of 1857 down upon both their own heads and those of the people and court of Delhi, engulfing all of northern India in a religious war of terrible violence.

Above all, Zafar always put huge emphasis on his role as a protector of the Hindus and the moderator of Muslim demands. He never forgot the central importance of preserving the bond between his Hindu and Muslim subjects, which he always recognised was the central stitching that held his capital city together. Throughout the Uprising, his refusal to alienate his Hindu subjects by subscribing to the demands of the jihadis was probably his single most consistent policy.

There was nothing inevitable about the demise and extinction of the Mughals, as the sepoys' dramatic surge towards the court of Delhi showed.

But in the years to come, as Muslim prestige and learning sank, and Hindu confidence, wealth, education and power increased, Hindus and Muslims would grow gradually apart, as British policies of divide and rule found willing collaborators among the chauvinists of both faiths. The rip in the closely woven fabric of Delhi's composite culture, opened in 1857, slowly widened into a great gash, and at Partition in 1947 finally broke in two. As the Indian Muslim elite emigrated en masse to Pakistan, the time would soon come when it would be almost impossible to imagine that Hindu sepoys could ever have rallied to the Red Fort and the standard of a Muslim emperor, joining with their Muslim brothers in an attempt to revive the Mughal Empire.

Following the crushing of the Uprising, and the uprooting and slaughter of the Delhi court, the Indian Muslims themselves also divided down two opposing paths: one, championed by the great Anglophile Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan, looked to the West, and believed that Indian Muslims could revive their fortunes only by embracing Western learning. With this in mind, Sir Sayyid founded his Aligarh Mohamedan Anglo-Oriental College (later Aligarh Muslim University) and tried to re-create Oxbridge in the plains of Hindustan.<sup>80</sup>

The other approach, taken by survivors of the old Madrasa i-Rahimiyya, was to reject the West *in toto* and to attempt to return to what they regarded as pure Islamic roots. For this reason, disillusioned pupils of the school of Shah Waliullah, such as Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi – who in 1857 had briefly established an independent Islamic state north of Meerut at Shamli in the Doab – founded an influential but depressingly narrowminded Wahhabi-like madrasa at Deoband, 100 miles north of the former Mughal capital. With their backs to the wall, they reacted against what the founders saw as the degenerate and rotten ways of the old Mughal elite. The Deoband madrasa therefore went back to Koranic basics and rigorously stripped out anything Hindu or European from the curriculum.\* 81

One hundred and forty years later, it was out of Deobandi madrasas in Pakistan and Afghanistan that the Taliban emerged to create the most retrograde Islamic regime in modern history, a regime that in turn provided the crucible from which emerged al-Qaeda, and the most radical and powerful fundamentalist Islamic counter-attack the modern West has yet encountered.

Today, West and East again face each other uneasily across a divide that many see as religious war. Jihadis again fight what they regard as a defensive action against their Christian enemies, and again innocent women, children and civilians are slaughtered. As before, Western Evangelical politicians are apt to cast their opponents and enemies in the role of 'incarnate fiends' and conflate armed resistance to invasion and occupation with 'pure evil'. Again Western countries, blind to the effect their foreign policies have on the wider world, feel aggrieved to be attacked – as they interpret it – by mindless fanatics.

Against this bleak dualism, there is much to value in Zafar's peaceful and tolerant attitude to life; and there is also much to regret in the way that the British swept away and rooted out the late Mughals' pluralistic and philosophically composite civilisation.

As we have seen in our own time, nothing threatens the liberal and moderate aspect of Islam so much as aggressive Western intrusion and interference in the East, just as nothing so dramatically radicalises the ordinary Muslim and feeds the power of the extremists: the histories of Islamic fundamentalism and Western imperialism have, after all, often been closely, and dangerously, intertwined. There are clear lessons here. For, in the celebrated words of Edmund Burke,<sup>82</sup> himself a fierce critic of Western aggression in India, those who fail to learn from history are always destined to repeat it.
