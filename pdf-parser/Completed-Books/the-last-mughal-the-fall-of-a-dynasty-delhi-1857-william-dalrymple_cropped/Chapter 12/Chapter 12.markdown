The assault on the city started exactly as planned. On the command, the officers leading each column gave the signal, there was a cheer, and the troops ran as fast as they could from the wooded shelter of Qudsia Bagh, through a rose garden, and out into the 50 yards of no-man's-land between the garden and the city walls. Here they were immediately met with 'a perfect hailstorm of bullets' from the ready and waiting sepoys.<sup>1</sup>

The first obstacle was the ditch, 20 feet deep by 25 broad. As the ladders were fetched and put into place the troops caught at the crest of the glacis, unable to get down, 'fell fast under the withering fire'. It was nearly ten minutes before the first troops had succeeded in rising out of the far side of the glacis alive; but once they had climbed to the breach, the momentum became hard to stop.<sup>2</sup> 'Up our men went, beautifully, like a pack of hounds,' wrote Fred Roberts to his mother. 'We gunners had done our work so well that the Breach was perfect and we gained the ramparts with comparatively slight loss.'<sup>3</sup>

It seemed much less smooth if, like Richard Barter, you were the first up. As he ran forward, Barter remembered seeing the heads of the defenders

rising from the gap in the ramparts, 'while along the walls they swarmed thick like bees. The sun shone full upon the white turbans and black faces, sparkling brightly on their swords and bayonets, and our men cheered madly as they reached the breach'.

The enemy whose fire had slackened when ours ceased, at first seemed perfectly taken aback at our appearance, but recovering from their surprise, they now recommenced in earnest: round shot came screaming from the guns far to our right, while grape and shells whistled from those nearer, and the walls seemed a line of fire along our front. Bullets whistled in the air, tore up the ground about our feet, and men fell fast …

Three times the ladder party was swept away, and three times were the ladders snatched from the dead and wounded … It was hard work getting up the breach, which was like a sloping bank of sea sand from the pounding of the shot. Behind it were some gabions, between which the enemy kept up a smart fire, so close to us that I could feel the flash of each discharge hot on my cheek. To spoil their aim, I kept firing my revolver with my right hand, while I scrambled up [the ladder] with my left, holding my sword under my arm as best I could, for we carried no scabbards. They kept heaving huge blocks of masonry at us, and tried to roll some down …

The defenders eventually retreated back into the city, leaving Fitzgerald and myself standing close up to the gabions. We shook hands and parted, he down the right of the breach, and I along the parapet to the left, towards Kashmiri Gate. I never saw him again, he was killed by a discharge of grape inside the walls, immediately after I parted from him.<sup>4</sup>

While running along the wall-walk, Barter heard a colossal explosion and, looking up, saw the Kashmiri Gate 'blown into Delhi'. The assault plan had called for ten sappers and a bugler to place a large explosive charge immediately in front of the gate, and for the troops then to rush the gap thus opened. As the assault had started a little later than planned, and it was now broad daylight, this proved more difficult than it sounded on paper. When

the signal for the assault was given, the defenders opened the wicket at the bottom of the gate and began firing directly at the sappers as they tried to carry the charge into place along the damaged bridge, only one beam of which now remained.<sup>5</sup>

In the lead was the twenty-seven-year-old Philip Salkeld, who had been one of Edward Vibart's companions in the escape from that same gate on the evening of 11 May, and who in the days of wandering that followed had honourably donated his shoes to Annie Forrest. Now he led the explosion party's precarious charge over the remaining beam, holding the fuses that were intended to set off the powder. Four men followed carrying the explosive bag into place; seven others, including Salkeld, were supposed to nail it to the wooden door of the gate and set the fuses and slow matches than would detonate it.

As Salkeld's party neared the gate, the defenders opened fire at point blank range through the wicket and down from the loopholes. First one of the sappers, then a second and a third and a fourth were shot down as they tried to nail the powder to the door. Within a few seconds, all the party except three were either killed or severely wounded, while Salkeld was mortally injured with two terrible wounds. But one of the three survivors, Sergeant Smith, although also badly wounded, still managed to relight the extinguished fuse and throw himself under the bridge as the charge went off, blowing the right leaf of the double gates off its hinge. One of the other survivors was the bugler, Hawthorne, who sounded the advance from the shelter of the ditch, giving the signal for the British troops to charge and take the gate.<sup>6</sup>

It was now a quarter to six. The troops of the third column had been lying flat, just inside Qudsia Bagh, out of range of the muskets, waiting impatiently for the bugle call. But such was the noise of musketry from the walls that Hawthorne's first two bugle calls were not audible; only the third was faintly heard. One of those waiting for the sound was the angry and violent Anglo-Irish Protestant, Lieutenant Kendal Coghill, who had been dreaming dreams of vengeance and retribution for months up on the Ridge. Now, he wrote to his father, the moment had come, and 'bloodthirsty and eager as I was for it, a species of wildness and madness came over me, knowing that the quicker the rush, the nearer the enemy, and earlier the revenge'.

I took a firm bite of the pistol bullet in my mouth which was there to keep the mouth moist, and with a devil's yell, I rushed from under cover. The musketry poured in like rain, and men kept falling on every side of me, but I thought my life charmed and they could not touch me. The curses, moans and execrations of the wounded and dying, cursing their fate at being left outside and not being able to revenge themselves, was pitiable in the extreme and they rolled and writhed in agony.

We were to have stormed the left but the fire on the right was so heavy that all the ladder party there were shot down, so we … rushed to the right [to take their place]. After that I felt like a drunken man. I just remember putting my sword back and seizing the ladders and throwing them down into the ditch, but the ladders were only 8 feet and the ditch we found was 20 feet deep. In the excitement we dropped below and the ladders reached the berm on the other side, and up we rushed.

The brutes fought till we regularly hacked and cut our way through them with sword and bayonet. Unfortunately the first thing my sword struck was the body of a colour sergeant of mine just along side of me on the next ladder who was shot and fell on my sword. But the next moment it was shivering through a Pandy, and then another. All order and formation was over and we cut and hacked wherever we could. I never thought of drawing my pistol, but poked, thrusted and hacked, till my arms were tired.<sup>7</sup>

Ten minutes of desperate hand-to-hand fighting later, the gate and the main guard enclosure had fallen to the British, and the Union Jack fluttered above the archway. <sup>8</sup> But even fiercer resistance was met a little farther down the street at Skinner's haveli, opposite St James's Church. This had been fortified by the Nasirabad troops, who had used it as their headquarters throughout the siege. Others had taken up position firing over the low churchyard wall of St James's.<sup>9</sup> Both parties now let loose such a storm of grape and musketry that they managed to kill many of the front ranks of the British before retiring – Sa'id Mubarak Shah thought maybe as many as three or four hundred British troops fell between the Kashmiri Gate and the Skinner haveli.<sup>10</sup> But since all three of the British columns were now

concentrating their fire at the house and the churchyard, the Nasirabad sepoys had no option but to retreat, taking their guns with them.

Outside, in the open space facing St James's Church, Nicholson now gathered the troops of the three columns.<sup>11</sup> Realising, however, that much of his own column had already set off along the walls without him, and without wishing to pause to allow time for the rebels to regroup, Nicholson took what remained of his party and headed off westwards along the parapet. His aim was to catch up with his lost troops, and to capture the Kabul and Lahore gates as quickly as possible. There they would join up with the fourth column, under Major Reid, which was supposed to have fought its way down from Hindu Rao's House, through the suburb of Kishenganj. In this way, according to Wilson's plan, the British would gain control of the whole northern and western perimeter of the city by lunchtime.

Theo, meanwhile, set off with the second column, largely made up of Gurkhas, whom he guided through the backstreets in the direction of the Jama Masjid. The third column made its way south-east towards the Red Fort by way of the Delhi College. As the troops set off, General Wilson came in from Ludlow Castle, from the roof of which he had watched the assault, and set up his headquarters in the wreck of Skinner's gutted haveli. A canteen and field hospital were established nearby inside St James's Church.

It was at this point – just after seven in the morning – that things suddenly began to go badly wrong for the British. It had been presumed that getting within the walls was going to be the most difficult part of the assault, and this feat had now been achieved, with relatively low losses, and ahead of schedule. But it was the next stage – advancing through the streets – which was actually to prove far more costly. Once the British were known to be advancing on the Fort, it had been expected that the sepoys' nerve would fail and they would sooner or later turn and flee. Not only did this not happen, but the rebel forces now counter-attacked and fought back with such astonishing force that they very nearly succeeded in driving the British out of the city and back up to the Ridge. Bakht Khan and Mirza Mughal had made their preparations well. As Fred Roberts succinctly put it, 'from this time, we suffered severely'.<sup>12</sup>

Charles Griffiths was with the column that was heading southwards towards the Fort. They had just begun to advance slowly through the gardens of the wrecked and looted Delhi College when they walked straight into an ambush. Suddenly,

from every window and door, from loopholes in the buildings, and from the tops of the houses, a storm of musketry saluted us on every side, while every now and then, when passing the corner of a street, field guns loaded with grape discharged their contents into the column. Officers and men fell fast. This only served to exasperate the remainder … who after some severe skirmishing, cleared the gardens and houses of the rebels, and bayoneted all who were found there.

So severe were their losses, however, that the column gave up any attempt to advance farther, and began to fortify the College as their front-line strongpoint.

Theo's column was drawn farther into the town before they found themselves cornered by the jihadis. Theo had been picking his way gingerly through the back lanes, losing men to snipers and occasional flurries of grapeshot. The streets were almost deserted, and initially they came across surprisingly little resistance. They passed nervously over Chandni Chowk, and advanced through an eerie silence as far as the north gate of the Jama Masjid.

They had just realised that they had brought no powder charges to blow open the mosque gates, when in the silence the doors slowly opened of their own accord, and the massed jihadis waiting inside emerged screaming down the steps. According to Sa'id Mubarak Shah, the jihadis 'hurled themselves upon the English who, overmatched, fell back with the loss of two guns', and around forty dead.<sup>13</sup> As the British retreated back into Chandni Chowk, the jihadis were supported by a field gun brought over from the Lahore Gate, which fired down the length of the bazaar and landed a shell directly 'in the midst of the English column, killing and wounding upwards of fifty of them'.<sup>14</sup>

The remains of Theo's force lingered for half an hour in Chandni Chowk, trying to fend off the axes and swords of the jihadis, hoping that

Griffiths' column, which was now supposed to rendezvous with them, would come to their rescue. But when thirty minutes had passed, and it became clear that the other column had also run into trouble, the order was given to retreat to the Kashmiri Gate.<sup>15</sup>

While this was happening, up on the city walls, Nicholson's force had also found themselves in severe difficulties. During the taking of the Kashmiri Gate, the column had split up and Nicholson had lost most of his troops, as they had continued forwards along the walls without him. Richard Barter was one of these: he made his way gingerly, darting from arched recess to arched recess, along the base of the city walls. 'Into these we used to rush every time we saw the port fires being put to the guns which we ran across every now and then raking down the road. When the storm of grape had flown past, and before they could be reloaded, we used to take them with a rush and bayonet and shoot the gunners.' Every so often, Barter's party would stop to attack houses containing sepoys, surprise and kill them all, and then continue on along the foot of the walls.<sup>16</sup>

Others took a more careless approach to the danger. 'On we rushed [along the parapet],' wrote Lieutenant Arthur Moffat Lang in his diary, 'shouting and cheering, while the grape and musketry from each bend, and from every street leading to our left, and from rampart and housetop, knocked down men and officers'.

It was exciting to madness and I felt no feeling but to rush on: I only wondered how much longer I could go on unhit when the whole air seemed full of bullets … We took tower after tower, gun after gun, never stopping … We poured past the Kabul Gate and we went along until we nearly reached the Lahore; then a short check was given by a barricade with a gun firing grape from behind it. Brig Jones came up and called for the Engineer officer, and asked where the Kabul gate was … "Far behind," I said. "We shall have the Lahore presently." Alas he declared that his orders were to stop at the Kabul …

As long as we rushed on cheering and never stopping, all went well. But the check was sad: the men crouching behind corners, and in the archways which support the ramparts, gradually nursed a panic. One by one they tried to get back: we stopped them and

staved off the flight for half an hour, but at last out they all came, and sweeping back the officers, made for the Kabul Gate.<sup>17</sup>

Grapeshot from the heavy guns massed on the Lahore Gate and the Burn Bastion, and manned by Bakht Khan's Bareilly troops, was now sweeping the parapet and walls, and a full-scale retreat looked imminent. It was at this point that Nicholson appeared on the street below and tried to salvage the situation. Calling the terrified troops down to ground level and rallying them, he drew his sword and, despite the musketry and grapeshot, charged straight up the narrow street with the wall to his right and houses to the left, calling for the men to follow. Halfway up the street, he realised he was alone, and turned to call to the troops to support him. As he hesitated, still waving his sword in his hand, a sepoy sniper, probably on the Burn Bastion, fired down on him. The ball entered Nicholson's chest, just below the exposed armpit. One of the other fusiliers who had belatedly come up, pointed out that he had been hit. 'Yes, yes,' replied Nicholson irritably, before sinking to the ground.<sup>18</sup>

He was carried back to the Kabul Gate, where two doolie bearers were instructed to take him up to the field hospital on the Ridge. In the growing chaos, however, as the British assault stumbled to a halt, and as every one of the different columns fell back in disorder, the bearers abandoned the injured general by the side of the street. Some time later, Fred Roberts happened to be passing: 'While riding through the Kashmir Gate,' he wrote, 'I observed by the side of the road a doolie without bearers, and evidently with a wounded man inside.'

I dismounted to see if I could be of any use to the occupant, when I found to my grief and consternation, that it was [the dying] John Nicholson. He told me that the bearers had put the doolie down and gone off to plunder; that he was in great pain, and wished to be taken to the hospital. He was lying on his back, no wound visible, and but for the pallor on his face, always colourless, there was no sign of the agony he must have been enduring. On my expressing a hope that he was not seriously wounded, he said: 'I am dying; there is no hope for me.' The sight of that great man lying helpless and on the point of death was almost more than I could bear. Other men

had daily died around me, friends and comrades had been killed beside me, but I never felt as I felt then – to lose Nicholson seemed to me at that moment to lose everything.<sup>19</sup>

By noon, British spirits were sinking fast, as the exhilaration of having got inside the walls gave way to a growing realisation of the scale of the forces still ranged against them, and the strength of the rebels' determination to resist them: 'it was clear', wrote a surprised Colonel George Bourchier, 'that the enemy intended to dispute every street, foot by foot, with us'.<sup>20</sup>

The British now had control of just over a quarter of the city, but that quarter had cost them the largest losses they had yet suffered. No one had anticipated anything approaching the scale of the casualties that the Field Force were now taking: nearly a third of those who lined up to assault the city at dawn were dead by sunset – a loss of around 1,100 men and 60 officers, including Annie Forrest's sweetheart, Harry Gambier. Another casualty was Hervey Greathed, who had succumbed not to bullets but to cholera.

By now the field hospital on the Ridge was a scene of indescribable horror. Padre Rotton moved from bed to bed, trying to comfort the dying while 'surgeons and apothecaries [were] all busily engaged in operating. Almost every kind of amputation was performed: legs and arms, and even fingers, bloodless and shrivelled, no longer members of their respective bodies, lay carelessly on the ground'.<sup>21</sup> In the wards, the bodies of the wounded lay piled up, two or three to a single charpoy. Edward Vibart was there too, still smarting from being kept in the reserve and deprived of the chance to take part in the storm:

I above all others ought to have taken my place in the storming. But it was ordained by Providence that I should stop in camp and attend to the unfortunate wounded and dying men. Every minute poor fellows were brought in and I never witnessed such horrors. It made

my heart ache to see those ghastly sights … I went to ask after our poor major who had had his leg amputated, and all I saw was his body sewn up in a blanket … The insurgents fought desperately. One of their batteries we were thrice repulsed from, and I believe we have not taken it yet.<sup>22</sup>

Spirits were no higher in the British headquarters in Skinner's House, where the full desperation of the situation was beginning to dawn on the headquarters staff. 'About 12 I got some breakfast in the church,' wrote Fred Roberts to his parents, 'through which the round shot were coming pretty fast, and such a number of woebegone faces I think I have never seen before in my life'.

Every column had been obliged to retreat. Our best officer by ten thousand times, poor Nicholson, I had just seen put in a doolie with death on his face, and … no one seemed fit for anything. All of the old officers were completely at their wits end. To make matters worse, whether designedly I know not, but the shops with beer and brandy had all been left open and several of our men got drunk, others could not find their Regiments, and all were done up with the hard work we had had for the previous 5 or 6 days …

I dropped off to sleep, and notwithstanding all the noise, never awoke till sunset … [then] went around our positions. All the posts were in disorder. No rations had found their way into town. The poor devils of cook boys could not be persuaded to come in – the fire was so heavy from every corner. Europeans were drunk, and natives out plundering.<sup>23</sup>

Hodson was horrified by the speed with which both the discipline and the morale of the army seemed to have collapsed. 'For the first time in my life,' he wrote to his wife, 'I have lived to see English soldiers refuse repeatedly to follow their officers. The fact is that the troops are utterly demoralised by hard work and hard drink.'<sup>24</sup> Worse still, General Wilson seemed to have lost all confidence in his assault, and was actively contemplating retreat. 'Wilson is fairly broken down by fatigue and anxiety,' wrote Hodson, 'he cannot [even] stand on his legs.'<sup>25</sup>

By mid-afternoon, still more alarming news still came in: the fourth column under Major Reid had not only failed to take the Lahore Gate, but after the Maharaja of Kashmir's troops attached to Reid's force had bolted, Reid had had to retreat back to Hindu Rao's House in the face of a determined counter-attack under Bakht Khan and his Bareilly troops, 'supported by a mass of ghazis from the Bareilly and Nimach camps'.<sup>26</sup> Another section of the same brigade had also launched a spirited counterattack at sunset within the walls of the Mori Bastion 'in great numbers', and continued to probe forwards during the night.<sup>27</sup>

Kendal Coghill was among the troops pinned down on this northwestern front between the Mori Bastion and the Kabul Gate, and found the jihadis – 'a race of devils and fanatics' – especially fearsome adversaries. Like many of his colleagues he was surprised to discover that his earlier bravado and bloodlust quickly give way to naked fear: 'the natives were defending every place inch by inch', he wrote. 'It was a tough fight, and they had numbers and field guns against our few remaining men with muskets.'

But as our orders were peremptory to take and hold it, there was no help. It was then that I found we most wanted pluck. The men and officers were fatigued to death, the excitement over for the time. Our orders being to hold each gateway to the last, at each gateway and bastion we had left a detachment, so that at the Kabul [Gate] we had only about 200 men. The enemy regularly mobbed us with about 3000 men and 2 light guns attacked our front. If we had attacked them, they would have taken us in flank and retaken the gate. So we had to lie down flat and let the guns fire over us until they came near, and then our bayonets always told. The work continued from 9 a.m. till 4 p.m. and we were being picked off from a distance without a hope of retaliation or assistance coming to us, and we did not know what was going on to the left or rear, as we were the advanced right …

We had nothing to eat or drink the whole day and were awfully done. My sole consolation was a soda water bottle of weak brandy and water hanging to my side, and that had now been shot through and the liquor wasted. We were under arms all night, as they attacked us all through the dark.<sup>28</sup>

Unnerved by the loss of Nicholson, aware that Bakht Khan's advance up to Hindu Rao's House threatened to encircle and cut off his troops from their camp, and becoming hourly 'more anxious and depressed', Wilson was now visibly cracking under the strain. He was prevented from ordering an immediate withdrawal from the city only by his officers, led by the engineer Richard Baird-Smith, the man who had planned the details of the assault and who now 'insisted that "we *must* hold on" in such a determined and uncompromising tone that it put an end to all discussion'.<sup>29</sup>

One of Wilson's senior officers, Neville Chamberlain, wrote to Lawrence in Lahore to express his urgent concern that Wilson's frazzled nerves were going to lose the battle for Delhi single-handedly: 'he has frequently been more like an insane man than a General commanding a victorious army,' wrote Chamberlain, 'and it is so clear that his head, as he so frequently informs everyone, is gone'.

You must take these matters in hand or otherwise nothing will be done. The General attends to no one except in fits and starts when in difficulties; his answer to all suggestions is, 'It is impossible,' and he is always raising difficulties. He told me once that it was his intention to go to the hills after the fall of Delhi, and [frankly] it is a pity that he does not carry out this intention.<sup>30</sup>

When news of Wilson's wish to retreat reached the dying Nicholson up in the field hospital on the Ridge, he was, characteristically, even more forthright. Despite his pain and exhaustion, he reached for his pistol: 'Thank God', roared Nicholson, 'that I still have the strength yet to shoot him, if necessary.'<sup>31</sup>

The following day, calmer, he got a surgeon to take down a note to Lawrence in Lahore, seconding Chamberlain's letter. 'Tell Sir John', he dictated, 'that I recommend his doing what he can to supersede Wilson, who is broken down, and is moreover aware of it himself. I consider it trifling with our National Destiny keeping a man like Wilson in command of this force.'<sup>32</sup>

Zahir Dehlavi had woken early on 14 September and rode as usual across town to his duties in the Red Fort. Used by now to the sound of heavy gunfire, he was quite unaware of the significance of the fighting taking place less than a mile to the north. The first sign he saw of anything unusual was when he emerged from Chandni Chowk and encountered another royal official, heading in the opposite direction, who told him there was no point going on, since the Fort gates were locked.

It was only then that I noticed that nearly all the shops of the city were closed, and that the bazaar was unusually deserted, with only one or two men walking around. I thought that I should go and see for myself what the matter was, but when I reached the Lahore Gate [of the Fort] I saw it was barred, and that in front of the gate there were two loaded cannon. Nearby a crowd was standing around listening to a havildar give an account of the morning's fighting.

At this point a regiment of mounted soldiers rode up from within, and shouted to the guards to open the gates as they wanted to get out. The Havildar instructed them to go to the city's Kabul Gate as that was where the reinforcements were gathering. Hearing this, I turned towards my house.

I had not gone far when I saw the *Purbias* running out fast from the side of Bhawani Shankar's house, clearly fleeing from the fighting. The townspeople were disgusted at the sight of the cowardly Tilangas and asked them, 'after involving our city in this war, why are you now running away?' On hearing this, the *Purbias* threw down their guns and swords and said, 'we have been fighting, now why don't you give it a try?'<sup>33</sup>

Zahir decided it was time to head home, and warn his family; but when he got to Ballimaran, he found that the *muhalla* gate had already been locked. He then ran back towards the gate of the Chota Dariba on Chandni Chowk.

There also the gate was locked, but the small wicket had been left open. He squeezed through it, only to find that the fighting had now reached the kotwali: by pure bad fortune he had run straight into Theo's column heading for the Jama Masjid:

A volley of shots was now directed towards me from the side of the Kotwali, and the shots came and hit the road and the drains just like a hailstorm. A unit of the English army was standing directly in front of the Kotwali, shooting anyone they could see. A man standing next to me doubled over, shot in the stomach. I pulled him to safety through the wicket of the gate and then ran straight home …

On arrival I went to my room, and lay down, shocked to the marrow. I had just seen with my own eyes that the English army had entered the city, that the *Purbias* had run away, and now the English soldiers were going to come inside homes and start murdering. I thought the time to die had arrived, and that there was nothing to do but to pray, and wait and see what was going to happen.

I did not tell my mother or the members of my family anything that I had seen, and instead stayed in my room praying. After about an hour and a half there was a loud series of reports from a cannon, which sounded like it was coming from just outside my house. I was surprised as to how a cannon had entered our lane, so I took along two or three servants, and went out of the house to see what was happening.<sup>34</sup>

When Zahir's party reached the main road they asked the passers-by where the English Army had gone, and someone said that they had just been chased out. Zahir then went to the Chauri Bazaar, behind the Great Mosque, and there they saw that people were moving around armed with swords, knives, sharpened bamboo lathis and whatever weapons they could find.

When I came to the side of the Jama Masjid I saw such a huge pile of dead bodies that for a moment it looked like a woodseller's stall. More dead bodies lay scattered all around the Kilhih Bazaar and the

lanes between the mosque and the Kotwali. I asked the people in the streets what had happened, and they told me that a unit of the English army had come right up to the stairs of the Jama Masjid; at the same time some of the English soldiers had gone into the homes of the people and started looting them.

Then the soldiers had tried to enter the Jama Masjid, and the men who were inside thought that if they come in they will start killing inside the sanctuary, so it is better to go out of the mosque and confront them. So they charged out of the mosque with their guns … Many of the English troops were killed and injured … Eventually they retreated towards the Kashmiri Gate. There the English made their stand and positioned their cannon.<sup>35</sup>

Zahir went home again, and tried to get some sleep. The following morning, however, rumours were spreading through the city that the English troops had gone from house to house during the night, climbing into rooms through ladders, and barging into people's zenanas, where they killed the women as they slept, then stole their jewellery. It was not clear how much truth there was to the rumour – the looting at this stage seems to have been limited to the areas that had already fallen to the British around Kashmiri Gate – but the feeling of triumph that had swept through the town the previous day after the English had been driven back from the Jama Masjid quickly began to give way, in house after house across the city, to feelings of increasing panic.

![](_page_14_Picture_3.jpeg)

Sarvar ul-Mulk's family had heard at breakfast on the 14th that the British had got within the walls, and decided not to wait to be killed: instead they consulted with a cousin, Nawab Zia ud-Daula, and decided to take their chances and attempt to make it through to their cousin's house in Alwar in Rajputana while it was still possible to escape. Only Sarvar ul-Mulk's uncle

was against the plan: he had decided from his astrological calculations that the English were definitely going to be defeated.

My father with great regret returned [to his house near] the Delhi Gate, so that he should escort his own people, with the necessary things, to his elder brother's house; but he did not succeed in this, for suddenly a great hue and cry was raised in the [northern portion of the] City, and in every street and by-lane, hand-to-hand fights ensued. White soldiers, together with their Indian and Pathan allies, armed with all sorts of weapons, drunk with victory and full of the spirit of looting, made no distinction between woman and child, or young and old; and rivers of blood flowed. Then entering the zenanas, the various bodies of men began to loot and rob while the ladies – of whom Firdausi has correctly said, 'Not even the sun had penetrated to the skin of their bodies, which were so closely veiled' – unaware of the fate of their husbands, fled in all directions.

The [Delhi, or southern] gate of the city was close to our house, and my father and my maternal uncle, with the ladies and children and servants, fled through it in a great hurry and terror, and took refuge in a saint's tomb [outside the walls]. It was only when we were joined by our old servants, that we learned of the death of my uncle and Nawab Zia ud-Daula. It appeared that having armed themselves, they had left the house on foot with the ladies of the house and the children and servants, but that in the Chowk or close to it, they had encountered 'One-eyed Metcalfe' [Theo] and that in the fighting that ensued, both had been killed. It was not known what had become of the women and children.

The effect of this news on the audience was so sad it can barely be described. Our own state was little better, for we were in fear of our lives and property from both sides – on the one hand the Mutineers, and on the other, the English and their supporters; and it appeared to us that the two parties were vying with each other as to which should carry the day in pillage or robbery?<sup>36</sup>

Sarvar ul-Mulk's family was not alone. In all the areas that the British now precariously controlled – the north-eastern quarter of the city – all the

houses were considered fair game for plunder, and no males of fighting age were considered non-combatants. A significant proportion of the inhabitants of Delhi, especially the moneylenders and those with property or businesses, having suffered four months of plunder at the hands of the sepoys, had longed for the end of the anarchy, believing that the return of the Company, for all its irritations and manifest injustices, would at least bring a return of law and order to the town. Moreover, the British were well aware of this tacit support through their many spies. None of the inhabitants of Delhi had expected a general plunder, still less a mass slaughter. But once within the walls, the British conveniently forgot all their allies and supporters. Even their most devoted spies were not safe, as Maulvi Muhammad Baqar discovered on or around 15 September when, without explanation, he was picked up and arrested.<sup>37</sup>

The extreme injustice of all this was something that horrified even the most sycophantic Anglophiles: 'In the city no one life's was safe,' wrote Muin ud-Din Husain Khan. 'All able-bodied men who were seen were taken for rebels and shot.' Ghalib, who had disliked the sepoys from the beginning, was now no less horrified by the barbarity of the returning British. 'The victors killed all whom they found on the streets,' he wrote in *Dastanbuy*. 'When the angry lions entered the town, they killed the helpless and weak and they burned their houses. Mass slaughter was rampant and streets were filled with horror. It may be that such atrocities always occur after conquest.'<sup>38</sup>

Some of the most brutal killers were those who had lost friends or members of their own family at the outbreak. Soon after the British entered the city, Charles Griffiths met John Clifford, the former collector of Gurgaon, who was the elder brother of Annie Jennings' friend and fellow choir-mistress, Miss Clifford. John had dropped his sister off to stay with the Jenningses in the Red Fort the night before the outbreak, and now blamed himself for her death, preceded – so British myth had it – by gang rape. Griffiths was no peace-loving liberal, but he was profoundly chilled by what he saw: 'My old school friend had become a changed being,' he wrote. 'All his passions were aroused to their fullest extent, and he thought of nothing but revenge.'

Armed with sword, revolver and rifle, he had been present at almost every engagement with the mutineers since leaving Meerut …

dealing death with his rifle and giving no quarter. Caring nothing for his own life, so long as he succeeded in glutting his vengeance on the murderers of this sister, he exposed himself most recklessly …

I met him in one of the streets after we had gained entrance into the city. He shook my hands, saying that he had put to death all he had come across, not excepting women and children, and from his excited manner and the appearance of his dress – which was covered with blood stains – I quite believe he told the truth … There were other officers of the army in camp who had lost wives and relations at Delhi who behaved in the same manner as Clifford.<sup>39</sup>

Over and over again, however, the British found it possible to justify such brutal war crimes with the quasi-religious reasoning that they were somehow handing out God's justice on men who were not men, but were instead more like devils. In the eyes of Victorian Evangelicals, mass murder was no longer mass murder, but instead had become divine vengeance, and the troops were thus executors of divine justice. Padre Rotton, for one, was quite explicit about the degree to which the mass murder of the inhabitants of Delhi was actually, in his view, God's own work: 'I thought of God, and what He had already done for us … and then I thought of man, and the precious blood which he must shed in copious and living streams, ere God, by him, could avenge atrocity and wrong without parallel in the history of nations both ancient and modern.'<sup>40</sup> Even Edward Campbell, a gentle figure who was by the standards of the time no fundamentalist, still wrote of the assault on Delhi as 'my Saviour's battle' and liked to think of himself performing his duty as 'a good soldier of Christ'.<sup>41</sup>

'Truly these were fearful times,' agreed Charles Griffiths, 'when Christian men and gallant soldiers, maddened by the foul murder of those nearest and dearest to them, steeled their hearts to pity and swore vengeance against the mutineers.'

The same feelings to some extent pervaded the breasts of all those who were engaged in the suppression of the Mutiny. Every soldier in our ranks knew that the day of reckoning had come for the

atrocities which had been committed, and with unrelenting spirit dedicated himself to the accomplishment of that purpose … It was a war of extermination, in which no prisoners were taken and no mercy shown – in short one of the most cruel and vindictive wars this world has seen … Dead bodies lay thick in the streets and open spaces, and numbers were killed in their houses … Many noncombatants lost their lives, our men, mad and excited, making no distinction. There is no more terrible spectacle than a city taken by storm.<sup>42</sup>

The attitude of many of the British to the people who fell under their sway was well put by one soldier, who wrote from Delhi to the *Bombay Telegraph* decrying what he called General Wilson's 'hokum' that women and children must be spared. This 'was a mistake', he wrote, as they were 'not human beings but fiends, or, at best, wild beasts deserving only the death of dogs'.

All the city people found within the walls when our troops entered were bayoneted on the spot; and the number was considerable, as you may suppose when I tell you that some forty or fifty persons were often found hiding in one house. They were not mutineers, but residents of the city, who trusted to our well-known mild rule for pardon. I am glad to say that they were to be disappointed.<sup>43</sup>

Throughout the 15 and 16 September, the fate of Delhi hung in the balance.

The British made no further advances, except to inch forward from Delhi College and, on the morning of the 16th, to take the magazine immediately to its south; they also moved slowly from house to house from Skinner's haveli in the direction of Chandni Chowk. As Charles Griffiths put it, 'A few houses were taken in advance of our positions, but no further

movement on any large scale was attempted, owing to the demoralised state of the great proportion of the European infantry.'<sup>44</sup>

These modest advances now brought the British within mortar range of the Red Fort: unable to move any further owing to the strength of the resistance, they took out their frustration by setting up a battery in the garden of Delhi College and pouring shells down on Shah Jahan's magnificient palace. On the western front, they made no further advances of any sort along the city walls, and remained pinned down by Bakht Khan's troops and his artillery massed on the Burn Bastion. Frustrated, the British troops slowly dissipated themselves in drink and plunder, and soon lost all semblance of discipline. Our men were disorderly and unmanageable,' wrote Major William Ireland, 'and even the sense of the danger of our position could not keep them to the ranks.'<sup>45</sup>

In the headquarters at Skinner's House, Wilson's officers had their hands full trying to stop their general withdrawing altogether to the Ridge, or even, in his blacker moods, to Karnal. As he wrote to his wife on the evening of the 15th, 'we are now holding what we have taken but nothing more … The Europeans in the column with me have got hold of lots of beer in the shops, and made themselves helpless … This street fighting is fearful work. We have lost very heavily, both in officers and men. I am knocked up and unequal to any exertion. Altogether our prospects are not good. I cannot write more'.<sup>46</sup>

At this stage the city could have gone to either side, and a really concerted rebel counter-attack, especially one that aimed to take the now virtually undefended British rear, or captured the camp on the Ridge, would have forced an immediate British retreat from the city. What could have been achieved was shown on the evening of the 15th when a modest counter-attack, supported by the fire of the rebel artillery on the bastions of Selimgarh, drove the British from their new conquests back into their old Delhi College positions.<sup>47</sup>

For many of the rebel leaders, as for the people of the city, the frustration at this failure to fight back more effectively grew more acute as the hours passed. There were further instances of fleeing and depressed sepoys being attacked by mobs of Delhiwallahs, 'who in return for the bad treatment to which they had been subjected deprived them of their arms, beat them with shoes and disgraced them in every possible way, crying out

"Where is your boasted courage? What has become of your power, that you can no longer oppress and tyrannize over us?"'<sup>48</sup>

Then, in the late morning of the 16th, the people of the city spontaneously began to gather outside the Red Fort. With them were many of the jihadis, led by Maulvi Sarfaraz Ali, and 'several of the principal officers of the mutineer army', who went into the Palace and begged Zafar to lead them into battle, 'assuring him', according to Sa'id Mubarak Shah, 'that the entire army, the citizens of Delhi, and the people of the surrounding country would all follow, fight and die for him and expel the British'.<sup>49</sup> As more and more jihadis and city dwellers massed outside the Fort, 'some armed just with sticks, a few with swords, others with old muskets', this suddenly looked like a turning point.

Inside the Palace, the mood had been growing progressively more sombre. On the 14th Mirza Mughal had sent an urgent message to Zafar, and begged him to provide additional funds to pay the troops so that they could eat and fight properly. Zafar replied, 'send the horse harness, and the silver howdahs and chairs, to Mirza Mughal that he may sell them and pay all with the proceeds. I have nothing else left'.50° Shells were now falling almost every minute somewhere within the Palace walls: 'The King's residence must be a very warm one,' reported Neville Chamberlain to Lahore on the evening of the 17th, 'for we are pitting shells throughout the length of the palace enclosure, from north to south.'<sup>51</sup> To add to the gloom, the trickle of food supplies into the city had completely stopped, and people – including the princes and *salatin* – were literally dying of starvation.

Now, with the maulvis and jihadis gathering and asking him personally to lead a counter-attack, a moment of truth had come, but Zafar did not know what to do. Since 'Id, the Emperor had oscillated incoherently between a depressed hatred of the sepoys and all they had done to his city and palace, and a tacit if unenthusiastic support of Mirza Mughal's cause. At other times he seemed to have persuaded himself that he was a neutral observer in a struggle that had nothing to do with him. Now such indecision was impossible: however ambivalent and confused he felt, he must either lead the counter-attack, as requested, or refuse to do so. 'The King, afraid for his life, hesitated,' wrote Sa'id Mubarak Shah.

But they now earnestly entreated him saying, 'Your end is now approaching – you will be captured. Why die a shameful, dishonoured death? Why not die fighting and leave an imperishable name?' The King replied that he would place himself at the head of the troops at 12 o'clock that day.

As soon as the royal intention of leading the army to battle was known, further masses of mutineers, ghazees and townsmen collected in front of the Palace, not less than seventy thousand men. Presently the royal 'tomjon' [litter] was seen slowly issuing forth from the great gates, on which the troops and citizens advanced towards the magazine but halted about two hundred yards from it, as all who went further fell by the British bullets which bounced down the street like rain.

The King's tomjon had by this time almost reached another of the gates of the Palace and he sent continually to ascertain how far his army had advanced, but they were no nearer to the magazine when Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, forcing his way to his Royal master, told him that if he went any further he would to a certainty be shot, as European riflemen were concealed in the different houses. 'Moreover', whispered the Hakim, 'if you go out with the army to fight, how can I possibly explain your conduct tomorrow to the British, what excuse can I advance for you after you have joined the mutineers in battle?'

Zafar could no longer sit on the fence. He had to make up his mind one way or another, but still he hesitated, and as he dithered and swithered, the Anglophile hakim continued playing on his fears. According to his own account, he told his master, 'God forbid that the sepoys should take your Majesty out to the front of the battle, and then run off and you be taken prisoner. Never … These people bring disgrace on your Majesty for nothing. You ought never to have ridden forth.'<sup>52</sup>

'On hearing these words,' wrote Sa'id Mubarak Shah, 'the King left the procession and re-entered the Palace on the plea of going to the evening prayer. The mass of people and troops now became confused, then alarmed, and eventually they dispersed.'<sup>53</sup>

![](_page_22_Picture_0.jpeg)

If Zafar's decision to bless the Uprising on the afternoon of 11 May was a crucial turning point that transformed an army mutiny into the largest rebellion against their empire that the British would face in the course of the entire nineteenth century, so Zafar's catastrophic failure of nerve on the evening of 16 September was the decisive moment that marked the beginning of the end of that rebellion. The different Urdu sources are clear that the confidence and determination needed to resist the British, which had held up remarkably well up to that point, now began to fail the rebels in Delhi.

It was not that they had been defeated. Far from it: the British were on the point of collapse, as the morale and spirit of their troops continued to disintegrate; as late as the 18th, Wilson was still writing home that 'our men have a great dislike of street fighting … and get a panic and will not advance. I cannot see my way at all'.<sup>54</sup> But the rebels' confidence had been fatally eroded by Zafar's frightened retreat, and panic, once begun, now proceeded to pass swiftly through their ranks. The two armies had eyeballed each other for three days now, and thanks at least partly to Zafar's failure of leadership, it was the rebels who blinked first.

The people of Delhi, aware now that collapse was imminent, began to pack up and flee to safety: the British lookouts stationed on the roof of Hindu Rao's House reported that evening that 'streams of people and animals have issued from Ajmeri Gate'.<sup>55</sup> The trickle of sepoys leaving the city was now also becoming a flood, and Hodson saw from the 'Idgah that the Bareilly troops had begun blowing up their ammunition stores in preparation for flight. It was also reported by spies that the Bareilly and Nimach troops had sent off their baggage down the road towards Mathura, intending to follow it by forced marches as soon as the opportunity to escape from the town presented itself.<sup>56</sup>

'The spirit of the mutineers now completely deserted them,' wrote Sa'id Mubarak Shah,

and they contemplated the entire evacuation of the capital. Whenever the Europeans saw an opportunity, they made their way into the main streets and bazaars, and shot all who opposed them … Soon along the whole of the Chandni Chowk to the Palace, and even to the Lahore Gate, only scattered parties of sepoys and ghazees were to be seen – all the rest had fled.

That night, the 16th, was the last, after more than two hundred years, that a Mughal emperor spent in the Red Fort of Shahjahanabad.

According to the tradition preserved by the family of his favourite daughter, Kulsum Zamani Begum, Zafar retired to the *tasbih khana* (his oratory), praying and thinking, as outside the sound of fighting drew closer and closer to the Red Fort. Then at eleven o'clock one of the eunuchs was sent to summon Kulsum Zamani Begum:

There were gunshots everywhere … The Emperor told me, 'I give you over into the hands of God. Go now with your husband. I don't want to be separated from you, but it will be safer for you now to stay away from me.' Then he prayed aloud for our safety, blessed us and handed over some jewellery and other valuables, and asked my husband Mirza Ziauddin to take us away. Our caravan left the Fort late at night. We reached the village of Korali, where we ate a simple meal of barley bread and yoghurt, but the next day, heading towards Meerut [the destination of so many of the British refugees from Delhi four months earlier], a party of Gujars attacked us and virtually stripped us naked.<sup>57</sup>

Some time after midnight and before dawn, in the early morning of the 17th, Zafar quietly slipped out of the Red Fort by the water gate, without telling his prime minister or even Zinat Mahal. He was alone but for a party of attendants, and brought with him only a selection of his ancestral treasures, including 'the state jewels & property with lists of the same', as well as a palanquin.<sup>58</sup> As dawn broke, Zafar took a boat down the Yamuna, probably to the jetty at the Old Fort, the Purana Qila, from where he made his way to the great Sufi shrine of Nizamuddin three miles southeast of Shahjahanabad.<sup>59</sup>

According to traditions preserved by the family of the shrine keepers, the Nizami family, Zafar then handed over his ancestral relics into their safe keeping. These included a reliquary that he had specially carried from the Red Fort. The box contained three sacred hairs from the beard of the Prophet which had passed as a sacred trust from father to son in the House of Timur since the fourteenth century, and to which Zafar had been especially attached: the Palace diary and other accounts refer to him personally bathing the hairs in rosewater. <sup>60</sup> Having prayed at the shine, and eaten a simple breakfast given to him by the *pirzadas*, Zafar then allegedly burst into tears, telling the head Sufi:

I always thought these rebel soldiers would bring disaster down on our heads. I had apprehensions from the beginning; now they have come true. These soldiers have fled before the English. Brother! Though my inclinations are those of a faqir and a mystic, yet in my veins runs that great blood which would keep me fighting to the last drop in my body. My forefathers have had worse days than these and they never lost heart. But I have read the writing on the wall. I see with my own eyes the fast approaching tragedy which must end the glory of my dynasty. Now there is not a shadow of doubt left that of the great House of Timur I am the last to be seated on the throne of India. The lamp of Mughal dominion is fast burning out; it will remain but a few hours more. Since I know this, why should I cause more bloodshed? For this reason I left the Fort. The country belongs to God. He may give it to whomsoever he likes.<sup>61</sup>

Saying this, Zafar delivered the relics into the custody of the shrine keepers, and set off by palanquin towards his summer palace abutting the Sufi shrine of Qutb Sahib in Mehrauli, where he had agreed to meet Bakht Khan. But after he had gone some way, Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh rode up, and told him that bands of Gujars were robbing anyone who set off in that direction, just as they had earlier robbed the British.

What Ilahe Bakhsh said was quite true, but what Zafar did not know was that Ilahe Bakhsh was in the pay of Hodson, and that he had come directly on Hodson's bidding, promising his paymaster that he would do his best to betray his cousin and to prevent Zafar from fleeing far from the city. In this way, although he had consulted no higher authority as to the terms he was

busy negotiating, Hodson hoped to make his name as a great imperial hero, and so cement his return to grace by bringing in the Emperor to be imprisoned and tried.<sup>62</sup> To the same end, Hodson had now quite separately concluded his deal with Zinat Mahal and her father, Mirza Quli Khan, who were still in Zinat Mahal's haveli in Lal Kuan. After much indecision, they had also promised to persuade Zafar to surrender, in return for the guarantee of Zinat's life, and that of the three men in her life: her father; her son Mirza Jawan Bakht; and her husband, Zafar. The guarantee that Zinat and her father negotiated very pointedly did not include any of her husband's sons by different wives.\* 63

Having been persuaded to change his mind, Zafar ordered that his palanquin be turned around and returned to Nizamuddin, where he waited for Zinat Mahal to join him.<sup>64</sup> Then together they made for the great mausoleum of Zafar's ancestors, which lay close by. This was the great marble-domed tomb of Humayun, the second Mughal Emperor. It was the first great monumental tomb to be built by the Mughals almost three hundred years earlier, in the mid-sixteenth century, and was still the most magnificent Mughal monument in Delhi.<sup>65</sup>

Here Zafar sent a message, instructing that elephants should be sent to the haveli of Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, telling him to join the imperial family at the tomb.<sup>66</sup>

Then Zafar retired into the tomb chamber of his ancestor, to wait and to pray.

![](_page_25_Picture_4.jpeg)

The news that Zafar had finally done what he had threatened to do for so long – to leave the Fort and make for the shrine of Khwaja Qutb – spread through the *muhallas* of the town like wildfire on the morning of the 17th.

By mid-morning great streams of people were pouring out of the Ajmeri Gate, while others – wrongly – decided they had less to fear from the British than the Gujars, and took their chances, heading out of the Britishoccupied Kashmiri Gate. Here many men and teenage boys were shot dead,

while the women and children were allowed to proceed only after they had been systematically stripped by the guards of the money, jewellery and bundles they carried.<sup>67</sup>

Some of these refugees headed up the same routes – the Karnal and Meerut roads – that the fleeing British had taken four months earlier. Harriet Tytler, who herself had had to flee the town on 11 May, watched them go; almost alone among British observers, she found room in her heart to feel for them in their plight: 'What an experience it was to behold the myriads of women and children coming out of the Kashmir and Mori Gates,' she wrote.

Women who had never seen the outside of their zenana walls or walked but a few steps across their tiny courtyards, surrounded only by their own family or their slaves, now to have to face the gaze of European soldiers as well as their own … I was sorry for the poor things, more especially for the poor high-casted Hindu women to whom it was agonizing pain to be jostled along with sweeperesses and other women of low birth and caste.<sup>68</sup>

Zahir Dehlavi's family anxiously watched the people around them leave throughout the morning of the 17th, unsure of what to do. That evening, however, Nawab Hamid Ali Khan, the leader of Delhi's Shia community, came to beg the family to come with him and leave the city before it was too late.

'How are you sitting so coolly in your house,' he asked my father, 'when the King has left the Fort, and now all his subjects are also leaving the city? For goodness sake, leave your house and flee the city with your family this evening. Can't you see that killing and looting is going on all over Delhi? I am now going to take my wife and children, and leave this place. Please: put the women of your family with my family in the carriage.'

Nawab Hamid Ali Khan's house was next to the Kashmiri Gate, but a month earlier [after the British began shelling the area] he had rented a house next to mine [off Chandni Chowk] and was living there. My father decided to take the Nawab's advice, and though the sun was now setting, he gave the order that we should leave. In the

panic, everyone left in whatever dress they were wearing. My mother was so panicky that she did not carry even a ring other than those she was wearing at the time. At least my wife had kept her wedding clothes which were worth about two thousand five hundred rupees. She also had with her a small case of jewellery. She wrapped all the things in a cotton mattress and rolled it up like a bolster, then spread the mattress in the bullock rath.

The party set off through the streets of the city in which they had lived all their lives but which was now almost unrecognisable:

In the streets there were terrible scenes: as we left we saw the agony and helplessness of the people, as well as their fear and poverty. We saw the plight of the women who had always observed pardah and had never come out like this on the streets, and who were evidently unaccustomed to walking. We heard the howling and crying of the children. It was such a heart-rending scene that only the person who has ever witnessed such a thing can really comprehend it.

We all – men, women and children – came out of the Delhi Gate, and the ground outside was like a scene from Hell. Thousands of women in pardah with little children, along with their harassed and worried men, were all leaving the city. Nobody was conscious of what sort of condition they were in, or where they were heading, they were just moving. After a lot of trouble and problems, our group reached the *Barf Khana* [Ice House, situated under what is now Connaught Place]. The whole place had been hired from its owners by Nawab Hamid Ali Khan Sahab. We all spent the night there, glad to be safe and under cover, though none of us had anything to eat.<sup>69</sup>

Late that afternoon, Bakht Khan's troops had finally abandoned their forward positions in Kishenganj which had so seriously worried General Wilson. Now that his rear, the Ridge and the camp, were no longer threatened, the general at long last felt capable of pushing on with some vigour. Though the Burn Bastion still held out, and the western half of the town continued to defy the British, in the eastern half British troops were

now making steady progress through the streets, and by the evening of the 17th, just after Zahir had left his house, they had taken up positions along Chandni Chowk.

As they moved forward, the British troops paused to loot the houses that they passed. The lucky inhabitants were expelled, the unlucky ones killed. Either way, no house was left inhabited behind the advance of the British troops: the conquered parts of the city were left echoingly empty. Maulvi Muhammad Baqar's son, the poet and critic Muhammad Husain Azad, was one of the luckier ones, at least relatively speaking. Unlike many of the young men of Delhi, he was not shot. He was in his house that evening with his wife and the whole joint family when, according to his later account,

The soldiers of the victorious army suddenly entered the house. They flourished their rifles and shouted: 'Leave here at once!' The world turned black before my eyes. A whole houseful of goods was before me and I stood petrified: 'What shall I take with me?' All the jewels and jewellery were locked in a box and were thrown into a well. But my eye fell on the packet of [Zauq's] Ghazals [of which Azad, Zauq's devoted pupil, was meant to be preparing the critical edition for publication following his master's death in 1854]. I thought, 'Muhammad Husain, if God is gracious, and you live, then all these material goods can be restored. But where will another ustad [master] come from, who can compose these ghazals again? While these exist Zauq lives even after his death; if these are lost his name cannot survive either.'

So I picked up the packet [of Zauq's verse] and tucked it under my arm. Abandoning a well-furnished home, with twenty-two half dead souls, I left the house – or rather the city. And the words fell from my lips, 'Hazrat Adam left paradise; and Delhi is paradise too. But if I am Adam's descendant – why shouldn't I leave my paradise just as he did?'<sup>70</sup>

As Azad's family limped out of Delhi, a stray bullet or a piece of shrapnel from an exploding shell struck Azad's year-old baby daughter; she slipped into a coma, and after a few days, she died.

That night, Azad's family also took shelter in the same Ice House in which Zahir was sheltering, though neither Azad's account nor that of Zahir mentions the other. Like Zahir's family, Azad's had left in a great panic, but by pooling their resources, they found they had a little flour, 'which was now as expensive as gold', and kneaded it on a piece of broken pot. A fire was built of leaves and dry twigs, and from some of the other refugees they borrowed garlic, chilli and salt to make chutney. Despite the conditions and the primitive nature of the food, Azad used to tell his children that he 'enjoyed the garlic chutney and half-cooked rotis more than any of the finest biryani, kormas or pullao' that he was to enjoy later in life.<sup>71</sup>

The next day bullock carts were found, and the party left for Sonepat under the care of a maulvi. But Azad did not go with them. He had already lost his home and his daughter, but he still had a father. Despite the extraordinary risk, the following day he headed back into Delhi to try to find and help Maulvi Muhammad Baqar, who was now locked up in British custody. Azad somehow managed to track down a Sikh general who was a friend of his father, and who agreed to help him. He also gave him both shelter and a cover by pretending that Azad was his groom. In this disguise, the general led Azad to the field where Baqar and the other prisoners were awaiting their trial and execution. Under these conditions, as Muhammad Baqar was led to the scaffold, father and son exchanged a long last look.

Soon afterwards, Maulvi Muhammad Baqar was hanged, and Azad, who believed that there was an arrest warrant out for him, was smuggled out of the city and began a life of wandering that would see him spend four years drifting alone and in extreme poverty through the length and breadth of India – to Madras and the Nilgiri Hills, then Lucknow, and eventually to Lahore, carrying his master's ghazals all the way.

It was only in 1861, when he managed to secure a low-level job in the postmaster general's office in Lahore, that he was able to begin rebuilding his life. It was here that he set to work preparing the edition of Zauq's work he had promised his master he would produce, and which would stand as a monument to a city, and a moment of intellectual and artistic creativity, that had now been utterly destroyed.<sup>72</sup>

![](_page_30_Picture_0.jpeg)

In the middle of the following morning, 18 September, the sun was completely eclipsed for five minutes. The city darkened ominously for nearly three hours, before the light slowly returned.

The British soldiers were unnerved by the event since no one had warned them to expect it. But for the Hindus it was an event of far greater significance. Even today in India, some high-caste Hindus will not go outside during an eclipse, and for twenty-four hours either side of the moment of eclipse Hindu temples are all locked and barred. In the syncretic atmosphere of Mughal Delhi, and especially in the Mughal court where Hindus were employed as astrologers, the eclipse was an event of terrifying significance: it was the ultimate ill omen, a signal of extreme divine displeasure.\* Although an eclipse was considered the worst possible moment to begin any journey, it was on this occasion taken as indicating that for the last lingering sepoys now was the moment to abandon the hopeless fight, and to escape the doomed city. 73

That evening, as the heavens opened for a late monsoon downpour, the sepoys fled down the Agra road – which was already clogged with trudging Delhiwallahs heading away as fast as they could from the advancing British and their no less violent Sikh, Pathan and Gurkha allies. 'The darkness worked on their superstitious fears,' wrote Charles Griffiths, 'and hastened their flight from the city on which the wrath of the Almighty had descended.'

That night it was reported that the rebels in great numbers were evacuating the city by the south side, and the Bareilly and Nimach brigades making off in the direction of Gwalior. Certain it was from this period that signs of waning strength appeared among the enemy, and fewer attempts at assault were made on our outposts …

Few crossed the Bridge of Boats by day owing to it being commanded by our guns. But on the night of the 19th, when sitting in the church compound watching the shells exploding over the Palace and Selimgarh, we heard distinctly, through the intervals of

firing, a distant confused hum of voices, like the murmur of a great multitude. The sound came from the direction of the river, and was caused by multitudes of human beings, who, escaping by the Bridge of Boats, to the opposite side, were deserting the city which was so soon to fall into our hands.<sup>74</sup>

On the afternoon of the 19th the British finally captured the Burn Bastion, having been repulsed yet again with huge losses the day before. Later that evening they captured the Delhi Bank building, and so positioned themselves for an assault on the Palace the following morning, the 20th.

![](_page_31_Picture_2.jpeg)

The fate of the Delhi refugees of the 17th, 18th and 19th September was every bit as grim as that of their British predecessors in early May. Passing along the same roads, in the same panic, they were attacked and robbed by the same predatory Gujar and Mewati tribes who had stripped the British earlier in the summer. Although there are few surviving contemporary firstperson accounts of these Indian refugees surviving, certainly compared to the voluminous British accounts of 11 May which appeared in print within a few months of the end of the Uprising, there still survives among some old Delhi families a rich oral tradition of the misadventures that befell their great-grandparents in 1857. Some of these were collected from old people in the early twentieth century by Khwaja Hasan Nizami in a book called *Begmat ke Aansu* (Tears of the Begums), finally published in 1952.

Typical was the story of Mirza Shahzor, who fled Delhi with his pregnant wife, younger sister and mother in a pair of carts 'soon after Emperor left the court'. Like many of the Mughal refugees, they headed first for the shrine of Qutb Sahib in Mehrauli, where they spent a night. The following morning they set off again, but were attacked and looted by Gujars a few kilometres away near Chhatarpur. The tribesmen took everything they had, but spared their lives. 'The women were crying,' remembered Mirza Shahzor. 'I tried my best to console them. There was a

village nearby. My mother would stumble at every step and kept lamenting the fate that was making her see such severe hardships at that age. But the village was inhabited by Muslim Mewaties, who gave us shelter in the communal *chaupal* at the centre of the village.'

The villagers took the refugees in, and fed them, but after a few days asked Mirza Shahzor to make some sort of contribution in return:

'Why do you sit all day?' they asked. 'Why don't you do something?' I said I was happy to work: 'I come from a martial family. I can fire a gun and known how to wield a sword.' But at this the villagers started laughing saying, 'here we don't need you to fire bullets, but to manage the plough and dig the earth.' There were tears in my eyes at this and seeing this the villagers took pity and said, 'alright, why don't you look after our fields, and your women can sew things and we will give you a share of the harvest.' So that was how our lives developed: I would be in the fields all day, chasing birds, and the women sewed clothes at home.<sup>75</sup>

For two years they lived with the villagers and suffered as they did: they learned what it was to experience real hunger; monsoon floods nearly washed them away; and with no doctor to attend her, Mirza Shahzor's wife died in childbirth. Soon after, what remained of the family was able to return to Delhi, to begin a new life on the pension of five rupees a month that the British offered the few surviving members of the imperial family.

Many others suffered a similar fate. Zafar Sultan was the favourite son of Mirza Babur, the Emperor's Anglophile younger brother, who was famous for wearing foppish British clothes and for building an Englishstyle bungalow within the Red Fort. On 19 September, as the fall of the Palace drew nearer, he put his blind mother in a bullock cart and got a driver to take them through the Ajmeri Gate and up the road to Karnal. The first night, having successfully evaded both the British and the Gujars, they halted near a village, and fell fast asleep. The following morning they woke to discover that the driver had made off alone, taking the bullocks with him.

They found shelter in a Jat village, where they were given a meal, but before long the Jats fell on them, suspecting – correctly – that they had brought with them some priceless jewellery. When Zafar Sultan came to, he saw everything had been taken from them, they had been dumped in the

jungle, and that his elderly mother, who had been struck on the head with a lathi, was now dying. 'I asked her how she was, and she said, "I am the sister-in-law of the Emperor of India and look at my fate – I am dying in the jungle, and will not even get a shroud for a burial." So saying she passed away. I somehow gathered the strength to bury her as well as I could.'

Zafar Sultan became a fakir, travelling from city to city. He went to Bombay, and thence to Mecca, where he lived for a decade on the charity of pilgrims. Eventually he returned, via Karachi, to Delhi, 'because I could not forget this city … Here I worked as *thelewala*, carting bricks to help build the new railway, and eventually saved up enough to buy my own brick cart'. He refused the offer of a government pension because he thought it was better 'to earn a living by hard work than to survive on a pension'.

When Khwaja Hasan Nizami came across Mirza Zafar Sultan in 1917, he was a deaf old man. His identity had been revealed when he had been taken to court after getting into a fight 'with a rich intoxicated Punjabi businessman' who had taken out his riding whip and started beating the old man after his brick cart had collided with the businessman's car. He had taken the first few blows quietly, but finally had mustered the courage to resist, and hit the businessman so hard he broke his nose. 'The rich do not think anything of the poor,' Zafar Sultan told the court. 'But sixty years ago this man's forefathers would have been my slaves. And not just them, but the whole of Hindustan used to obey my orders. I have not forgotten my lineage, so how could I tolerate such insults? Just look how that coward ran away when I hit him. It is not easy to endure a Timurid's slap.'<sup>76</sup>

On 20 September, the British advanced on the Red Fort from their front-line position in the ruins of the Delhi Bank. During the night of the 19th the guns lined up in front of the Palace were spiked, and at ten o'clock on the morning of the 20th an explosion party ran forward under covering fire to place the powder bags under the gates. Unlike the taking of the Kashmiri Gate, at the Palace there was virtually no resistance, and it became obvious that most of the Palace's defenders had already fled, except for a few

determined jihadis who had preferred to die rather than hand over the seat of their emperor – Caliph of the Age, He who is Surrounded by Hosts of Angels – without a struggle.<sup>77</sup>

Edward Campbell was one of those commanding the assault, but much the fullest account was left by his deputy, a young army captain named Fred Maisey. 'After an interval of suspense, the powder bags blew up with a tremendous explosion,' he wrote to his mother and sisters in Switzerland. 'Half of the huge gate fell heavily over, then with a shout in we all went: officers, sappers, Europeans, natives, all pell mell, and with a want of order which had there been any steady resistance, would have made a terrible mess.'

I tried to get one or two officers to get their men into something like order – but away they all scampered, and all I or anyone else could do was to scamper also. There was some brisk musketry firing in the arched passage leading to the first courtyard and sundry Pandies, who were idiotic enough to fight, were slain. There was more danger from our own bullets than from theirs, so we were glad to get out of the passage and into the open.

I went to the left as that was the way towards Selimgarh, and someone said that the King was in that direction. I led the party accompanied by an Afghan sirdar, Meer Khan, who had aided our side with a body of *very* irregular horse. Such a handsome, black bearded eagle-eyed fellow, and so excited at the thought of capturing the King (whom he would most infallibly have killed). We went plunging along through several gateways and narrow streets, for you must understand that there is a complete town within the palace walls. We expected every moment to meet with a volley, but we only saw two men on our route – both of whom our Afghan friend fired on and dropped like partridges …

[Eventually] I caught hold of a man who peeped out of a doorway and made him come along by my side. He was not armed and appeared to be a bullock driver. I told him if he would stay near me and show us the way and give good information, I would see that he would come to no harm – but my guarantees that day were worthless. My Afghan friend was at my heels. I told him that the old fellow was my prisoner and that I had promised him that he

should not be hurt. The man rubbed his head on the ground and thanked him as well as his fright would allow him. The poor wretch ran along by my side pointing out the way. We had scarcely gone ten yards when I felt a whiz and a flash, and down fell my prisoner shot through the body. That rascally Afghan had shot him, and almost set me alight in doing so. I was very angry – but the sirdar was quite independent of me, and could not understand why a promise made to a *badmash* caught in the enemy's stronghold should be binding.

After a while, Maisey and his companions heard firing from the centre of the Palace enclosure, and decided to join the centre party, as their part of the Palace seemed completely deserted.

We found the party – men, officers and horses all jumbled together, brought to a standstill by huge metal studded gates [of the Naqqar Khana Darwaza] strongly padlocked. What with bangs with heavy beams, shots from muskets, and other violent measures, the gates were forced, and then, with a rush, we went pell mell into the central square of the palace, at the far side of which is the *Diwan-i Am*, or Public Hall of Audience. The court was full of looted carriages, buggies, carts, palanquins. A gun or two was there, evidently hastily abandoned.

On we pressed to the *Diwan-i Am* which we found had been made into a sort of barrack. There were some fifteen sick or wounded men there whom the men sorely wanted to fly at. However, the officers held the men in check and we began to question the fellows. One young Musalman, evidently very ill, was close to me and I asked him where the troops were, and where was the king … The man begged for his life, and I told him I would protect him if he could come with me, on the condition that he disclosed where the King was. He declared the King and his wife and younger sons were in the Private Apartments which were in the next or innermost court. The rascal lied. The King had gone days before and he knew it well. However we believed him. Then a shout was raised to search the next court.

Just then up came Black Beard, and no sooner did he see the Pandies than he flew at them with his men. No one could stop him and indeed I do not think the men wished to. As to the officers, such was the crash and confusion that we scarcely knew what was going on and we were quite powerless even had we known. A few screams and groans told the tale. I left the man I had spoken to alive and in the care of some privates – for I could not stay there when all were rushing ahead – but he too was afterwards killed. I heard that out of 12 or 15 men, Meer Khan had himself killed eight. I never saw such a bloodthirsty savage.<sup>78</sup>

It was a measure of the secrecy with which Hodson had conducted his negotiations that no one in the storming party seemed to know that the Emperor was no longer in his palace, although Hodson was in direct communication with Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh, and knew the exact whereabouts of almost all the senior members of the imperial family. Having broken through the Lal Pardah, the British troops then poured into the inner courtyards, running down the cloister arcades searching for the royal family, who they believed still to be there.

Soon the armed heel and the ring of weapons clashed through the cloistered precincts of the *Diwan-i Khas* and within the still more exclusive chambers where never before had English feet trodden: the private rooms of the Mughal Emperors, the bowers of Nur Mahal and odalisques unnumbered, store rooms, pantries, cubbies, baths, all were ransacked by the outside barbarian without any thought at first save of discovering the King and his family. But we soon found that 'the cupboard was bare', and then the genie of plunder arose and such a scene ensued as I fancy has never yet been equalled.

A motley crowd of troops and followers ransacked every hole and corner, turning everything topsy-turvey (themselves included very often) in the search for loot. Muskets were being fired right and left to force the locks off doors. As the men got more and more scattered, the bullets flew more and more avidly, and the risk was considerable. I never saw such confusion. All sorts of loot had been brought into the palace by the mutineers and presented to the king

and members of the court, and this and the palace furniture, men and women's clothing, dancing girls' frippery, vessels of food and drink, rich hangings and trappings, books and manuscripts had all been tumbled higgledy piggledy into various small rooms about, and were all retumbled and tossed over and over again by our excited soldiery.

Here you saw a group fumbling among mysterious boxes in search of jewels, there others laden with stuff of various kinds – pictures, books, guns, pistols, anything that took their fancy. Some tried the sweetmeats and sherbets, others, less lucky, took long steep draughts of what seemed some right royal drink – and alas turned out to be medicine, and found out, too late, that the old King has a passion for pharmacy, and kept large supplies close to the royal elbow.

We did not find a soul in the private apartments, and as to the plunder, the greatest part was the merest trash, and there was nothing whatever of any value. I picked up in the King's private pavilion a perfect new air cushion which Kate [Maisey's wife] now has in her *janpan* or hill litter. That was the only thing I looted at Delhi, but this little souvenir, however, I was determined to keep, and I told the Prize Agent [Edward Campbell] so. The men at last began to quieten down from sheer fatigue and were collected by the officers. A deputation was sent to report the capture of the palace to the General.<sup>79</sup>

That evening, as British soldiers danced jigs inside the Jama Masjid and as the Sikhs lit victory fires next to the mosque's holy *mihrab*, General Wilson and his headquarters staff moved in from St James's Church to the Fort's Diwan i-Khas, where a dinner of eggs and ham was eaten ('I wonder what the *genius loci* thought of this,' pondered Fred Maisey). The general proposed a toast to Queen Victoria: 'The Queen, God Bless Her'.<sup>80</sup> Later a telegram was sent by one of his officers to Lahore, proudly announcing that 'Our struggle has ended here. The widespread rebellion of mutinous Bengal army has received a complete defeat in Upper India. The days of Clive and Lake are again revived among us'.<sup>81</sup>

The news was also brought to Nicholson, who lay gasping and clinging on to life in his tent on the Ridge, attended by his great Pathan manservant and bodyguard. When Neville Chamberlain went to visit him to bring him the news he found him 'helpless as an infant, breathing with difficulty, and only able to jerk out his words in syllables at long intervals, and with pain'. He was, however, still well enough to fire a shot from his pistol through the side of the tent to shut up his irregular cavalry, who had gathered in vigil outside his tent.<sup>82</sup>

When told that the city was now in British hands, he replied, 'My desire was that Delhi should be taken before I die, and it has been granted.'<sup>83</sup>

He died three days later, and was buried beneath a marble plinth plundered for the purpose from Zafar's beloved Moonlight Garden, the Mehtab Bagh.

While the Palace was being stormed, and toasts to Queen Victoria proposed, elsewhere in the city some of the worst massacres of the entire Uprising were taking place. The struggle may have ended for the British, but for many of the inhabitants of Delhi the worst trials were only now beginning.

In the morning, the British had swept around the city walls, capturing the Lahore and Ajmeri gates, and the Garstin Bastion. At the same time Hodson and his irregular cavalry rode around the outside of the city walls to the large sepoy camps outside the Ajmeri and Delhi gates, so finally encircling the city. They were deserted except for some 'sick and wounded [sepoys] who could not walk', who were immediately put to the sword. Their corpses were left with the litter of the camp debris – ammunition, clothes and plunder as well as 'their drums, band instruments, bedding, cooking pots etc, and all their luxuries', which had been abandoned in their flight.<sup>84</sup>

Soon afterwards, the order was given to 'clear' the area around Delhi Gate. Edward Vibart was one of those who took part in the massacre that followed. 'I have seen many bloody and awful sights lately,' he wrote to his

Uncle Gordon in a letter that oscillated between bloody bravado and flashes of awareness at the horrors he was committing. 'But such a one as I witnessed yesterday please God I pray I never see again.'

The regiment was ordered to clear the houses between the Delhi and Turkman Gates, which are the two gates that we have to hold, and the orders were to shoot every soul. I think I must have seen about 30 or 40 defenceless people shot down before me. It was literally murder and I was perfectly horrified. The women were all spared, but their screams, on seeing their husbands and sons butchered, were most terrible.

The town as you may imagine presents an awful spectacle now … heaps of dead bodies scattered throughout the place and every house broken into and sacked – but it is the [ordinary] townspeople who are now falling victims to our infuriated soldiery.

You can easily fancy with what feelings I visited all my old haunts yesterday, I went to all the old remembered places, and almost [succeeded in] imagining that nothing had taken place; but on looking around, the delusion was soon expelled for the marks of cannon and musketry were to be seen on all sides, telling but too well the mortal conflict that had been raging here not long before. A little further on you would come across a heap of dead bodies in the last stage of putrefaction, or some old woman in a state of starvation, and you could not help wondering how you could ever delight in bloodshed and war. And a few yards further on still some [of our] drunken soldiers would reel past, exciting your pity not unmixed with disgust. Wherever you go, you see some unfortunate man or other being dragged out of his hiding place, and barbarously put to death.

Heaven knows I feel no pity – but when some old grey bearded man is brought and shot before your very eyes – hard must be that man's heart I think who can look on with indifference. And yet it must be so for these black wretches shall atone with their blood for our murdered countrymen – my own father and mother – sister and brother all cry aloud for vengeance, and their son will avenge them. Yes! He shall be seen in the fight, and shall never shrink [from bloodshed,] for God have given him both strength and courage.<sup>85</sup>

Worse still was the slaughter in Kucha Chelan, where an estimated 1,400 Delhiwallahs were cut down. Here Nawab Muhammad Ali Khan had attempted to resist the plundering and had shot dead three British soldiers who had climbed over his haveli wall and entered his zenana. Their companions went back to get the rest of their regiment, and returned with a field gun with which they blew the haveli apart.

There followed the mass murder of everyone in that quarter of the city. After the British and their allies had tired of bayoneting the inhabitants, they marched forty survivors out to the Yamuna, lined them up below the walls of the Fort, and shot them. Among the dead were some of the most talented poets and artists in Delhi, for Kucha Chelan was famous for being the most intellectual *muhalla* in the city. 'They were well-known and welloff people, men who were the pride of Delhi,' wrote Zahir Dehlavi. 'They had had no parallels in their own day, nor will we ever see their like again.'

For example, there was Miyan Amir Panja-kash, the great calligrapher, who had no one comparable to him on this earth. Then there was one of our greatest poets, Maulvi Imam Bakhsh Sahbai and his two sons, and Mir Niyaz Ali, the celebrated story teller of Kucha Chelan. About fourteen hundred people of that Muhalla were killed. Some were arrested and taken through the Rajghat gate to the river side and there were shot. The bodies were all thrown into the river. Meanwhile many of their women were so disturbed by what they saw that they left their homes with their children and jumped into the wells. For months afterwards, all the wells of Kucha Chelan were stacked with dead bodies. My pen refuses to describe this further. 86

One survivor was Qadir Ali, a nephew of the poet Sahbai who lived with him in Delhi, and who in his old age told the story of his escape to the Delhi historian Rashid ul-Khairi. 'Delhi was like the Place of Judgement,' he said, 'and prisoners were being shot rather than hanged.'

The soldiers readied their guns. Just then a Muslim officer came to us and said, 'Your death is imminent. There are guns in front of you and the river behind. So those among you who can swim should

jump in the river and escape.' I was a good swimmer, but Mamun Sahib [Sahbai] and his son, Maulana Soz, had never learned the art. I could not bear to save my life and leave them behind, but Mamun Sahib urged me on, so I jumped in the river and swam away. I kept looking back, and after I had gone fifty or sixty yards, I heard the gunshots and saw the line of people falling dead.<sup>87</sup>

Zahir Dehlavi had another, more personal loss that day. His father-in-law, who had quietly sheltered three Englishwomen throughout the siege, felt confident that the women would guarantee his safety, and so stayed on in the city after the rest of the family fled. But he was gunned down by looting Englishmen regardless, alongside his son and two servants.<sup>88</sup>

That night, while the officers feasted in the Diwan i-Khas, the plundering of the city continued. One officer who was aware of what was happening was Major William Ireland. 'The Sikh soldiers had dreamt of carrying away jewels and treasures that would make their families rich for ever,' he wrote. 'General Wilson had promised that the plunder of the city should, when realized, be distributed to the army … So guards were placed at all the gates, who seized everything that was attempted to be passed through, [but] the Sikhs were not so easily foiled.'

They got bullock wagons to be driven at night to the walls, and dropped their booty down to their friends below. Many women, too, were seized and carried away by them. It was not till the spoils of Delhi were seen passing up the Punjab, that the news of its capture was fully believed in the great Musalman cities of the North West … Many of the citizens were shot, clasping their hands for mercy. It was known, too, that a large proportion had wished us well. Helplessness ought to be respected in either sex, especially in those who have never done us wrong. It is as unmanly for an officer to drive his sword through a trembling old man, or a soldier to blow out the brains of a wounded boy, as to strike a woman.<sup>89</sup>

By the morning of the 21st, reports began to reach Zahir and his family in the Ice House that all the pro-British loyalists at court who had stayed behind in the city, confident of good treatment, had nevertheless been murdered by the British. Among these was Mir Haidar Ali, one of the

leading figures in the pro-British faction at court. Realising that anyone who had any connection with the court was now regarded as a legitimate target, Zahir understood that it was time that he and his brother separated from the rest of the family, and fled to safety. 'We heard that the spies who had been supporting the English were now continuing to work as informers, helping them to loot and kill and find people to hang, for which they received two rupees for each name …'

Nawab Hamid Ali Khan told my mother that he did not feel safe with my brother and me living in the Ice House. He said, 'send them away, they should go to where ever they can feel safe. These people [the British and their informers] will not leave anyone alive who has been connected with the court.' So I respectfully said to my father 'It is true: we should leave, and you will have to bear with our separation and permit my brother and me to go. We will go wherever God takes us. I am particularly concerned about my brother's safety since he has been working for the Royal Army, and the British will never spare him. If God wills to keep us alive then we will come back and find you.'

I then took a few thin pieces of silver and lined them in my shoes, between the top and the sole, and put two pieces in the fold of my pyjama string. I tied a dupatta around my waist, and took a stick in my hand. My wife, who was very shy, was weeping quietly. She had just lost her father and her brother, and now her husband was going too. As I was leaving, I whispered in her ear that she was now in the care of God: 'If I survive, I will come back for you, but if I am killed then please forgive me.' So saying, I called on the name of the Almighty and strode out towards the shrine of Khwaja Sahab [in Mehrauli].<sup>90</sup>

Zahir had hardly gone more than half a mile when he saw a troop of cavalry coming towards them. 'On reaching us they surrounded us and said they wanted to see what we were carrying. They did not find anything but one fellow took off my turban and carried it away. I then tied the dupatta from around my waist on my head, a little later another bandit saw it, and came and took it away too.'

It was the inauspicious beginning of what would be an entirely nomadic life for the next five years, wandering the roads of northern India, hiding and avoiding British patrols. Although he returned several times to Delhi, he was never again able to make it home, and survived as best he could by trading in horses, and travelling from court to court where his skills in calligraphy and Urdu poetry assured him at least some food and shelter.

On the night of the 20th, General Bakht Khan stopped at Humayun's Tomb and tried to persuade Zafar to accompany him to Lucknow, where he intended to continue the resistance. Again it was Hakim Ahsanullah Khan who convinced Zafar to stay: '"Recollect that you are the King," he said. "It is not right for you to go. The army of the English mutinied against their masters, fought with them, and have been utterly routed and dispersed. What has your Highness to do with them? Be of good courage, the English will not regard you as guilty." With such words he restrained the King from accompanying the army in its flight.'<sup>91</sup> Mirza Mughal, meanwhile, was persuaded to stay by the devious Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh.<sup>92</sup>

That night, Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh came into Delhi and told Hodson where Zafar and Mirza Mughal were sheltering, possibly at the instigation of Zinat Mahal and Hakim Ahsanullah Khan.<sup>93</sup> He also informed Hodson that Zafar had with him 'the state jewels and property lists of the same'.<sup>94</sup> Hodson promptly went straight to see Wilson and asked for permission to go and capture Zafar, arguing that 'victory would be incomplete if the king and his male relatives were allowed to remain at large'. Wilson at first said the enterprise was 'too dangerous', but under pressure from Hodson and Neville Chamberlain allowed Hodson to go if he took his own men and did not require a large force, adding, 'don't let me be bothered with them'; if Hodson wanted to go he could do so at his own risk, but would have to manage the whole business himself.<sup>95</sup>

On the morning of the 21st, 'a royal salute at sunrise proclaimed that Delhi was once more a dependency of the British crown'.<sup>96</sup> But the

captured city – the ancient capital of Hindustan, the great Mughal metropolis – was now a desolate city of the dead, except for parties of drunken British looters. Major William Ireland, a consistent critic of the brutality of his own colleagues throughout the campaign, was horrified by the sight of the 'liberated' city. 'The desolation of the great city was eloquent of the miseries of war,' he wrote. 'Save in the immediate vicinity of the houses in which soldiers were quartered, all was silent and deserted.'

There were no merchants sitting in the bazaars; no strings of camels or bullock wagons toiling through the gate; no passers-by in the thoroughfares; no men talking by the doors of the houses; no children playing in the dust; no women's voices from behind the screens. Household furniture of all kind was lying in the streets.

The spectacle was made only more melancholy by traces of recent inhabitants. The ashes were still black in the hearths, and domestic animals were roaming up and down in all directions in search of their late possessors. The houses were here and there burnt or shattered by cannon shot, and the fragments of shells scattered about, with rotten corpses now and then to be seen, half eaten by crows and jackals. The merchants had stuck to their shops to the last, and had been driven out only by the bombardment and the report of the fierce doings of our soldiers.<sup>97</sup>

Lieutenant Edward Ommaney of the Guides, an Urdu and Persian scholar who knew something of the history of the city, was also aghast at what he saw as the sun rose. 'The whole city is depopulated,' he wrote.

One only sees now and then, a body of sixty or so men and women going along the street to one of the gates, to leave the place; barring this, not one of the sepoys or the city people are seen. Our men may be seen in the empty houses, looting, and that is all. Of the 150,000 inhabitants, the whole nearly have left. Even when Nadir Shah conquered the city, this was not the case.\* 98

Soon afterwards, William Hodson sent off Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh accompanied by his 'Chief Intelligencer', Maulvi Rajab Ali, and a small

escort of Punjabi irregular cavalry; Hodson set off himself from the Fort towards Humayun's Tomb with a second body of cavalry, around fifty strong, 'after a brief interval'.<sup>99</sup> It was an expedition that he hoped would not only complete the restoration of his reputation in the army, but also put his name permanently in the history books.

Everything had now been arranged. The moment had come to arrest and bring back as his captive the man many of the British were now convinced lay at the heart of the whole rebellion, the spider at the centre of the web.
