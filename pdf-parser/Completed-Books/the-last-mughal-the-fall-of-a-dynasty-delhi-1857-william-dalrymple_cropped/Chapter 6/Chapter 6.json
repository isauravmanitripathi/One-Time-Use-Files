Far from the scene of mourning that might have been expected, he found instead a dry-eyed Emperor with a letter to the Governor General ready written in which he pressed yet again for the succession of Mirza Jawan Bakht; the body of Mirza Fakhru, he heard, had already been interred near the Sufi shrine of Qutb Sahib in Mehrauli. Zafar's letter argued that Jawan Bakht was suitable for the position, on the basis that his birth was legitimate and that he was, in the eyes of his adoring father at least, 'gifted with all the endowments, qualifications and virtuous habits necessary for a Prince, he having obtained a complete education under my guidance.

He strongly urged Canning that none of the princes should be recognised as heir apparent – least of all Jawan Bakht – and argued that the death of Mirza Fakhru, following closely upon the momentous annexation of the rich and independent kingdom of Avadh five months earlier, in February 1856, provided the perfect opportunity to prepare the Mughals for the imminent extinction of their line. This, he believed, should take place on the death of Zafar – an event which could not now be far away: 'It appears to me inexpedient to recognise any of the sons as Heir Apparent,' he concluded. 'The princes generally are not men of prominent influence or high personal character … little public interest is felt in the fortunes of the family and a favourable opportunity is presented, by the removal from the scene of the most respected member of the family, for</p>",

Before his departure he had had no previous interest in India, and by July he had yet to leave the heat and damp of Calcutta. Indeed, for almost all of his first few months in India he had found himself imprisoned in the 'miserably furnished' if outwardly magnificent Government House (which, he was horrified to note, did not possess a single water closet, 'there being no fall for drainage in Calcutta', surrounded by his Himalayan piles of dispatch boxes.

Britain's Indian Empire, wrote Canning, had never been so strong, so secure or so happy: 'The last few years have seen not only an extension but a remarkable consolidation of British power in India; its supremacy has become more uniform and unbroken even within the earlier limits of the Empire.' For this reason, 'the preservation of a titular King Paramount of Hindustan has thereby grown to be a greater anomaly than ever', and he therefore decided, in agreement with Fraser's views, that no Mughal prince would now be recognised as heir apparent. He concluded, 'The Upper Provinces of India are not now, as they were in 1849 or 1850, in an unsettled and uneasy condition. There is every appearance that the presence of a Royal House in Dehlie has become a matter of indifference even to the Mahometans.'<sup>20</sup></p>",

But they do not seem to have got any closer to Delhi than this, and even there no one seems to have understood what their significance was;* as far as the Delhi papers were concerned, it was certainly a matter given far less space than the reports of a fatwa being posted in Madras, 'calling on all believers to rise against the infidels … he who fell in such a war would be a martyr', and the excitable rumours that either the Russians or the Persian Army, or possibly both, were on the march and about to appear in Delhi. Most prominent of all were reports, which began to appear from late March onwards, of unrest in the army in Bengal, especially at Berhampore and Barrackpore: according to Theo, by the spring of 1857, the people of Delhi 'were perfectly aware of the want of fidelity in the sepoy army and the subject was frequently discussed'.<sup>23</sup></p>",

The excuse for this was that its Nawab, the poet, dancer and epicure Wajd Ali Shah, was 'excessively debauched'.* The people of Delhi were used to the British bullying and plundering the Nawabs as they had done for nearly a century now; but the outright annexation of the kingdom had nevertheless caused far more alarm across northern India than the British seem to have realised or indeed anticipated, and increased awareness of the precariousness of the Mughals' own position. More importantly, it greatly unsettled the sepoys of the Company's army, most of whom were drawn from uppercaste Hindu families in rural</p>",

Even British officials were aware that what had happened was not one of the more honourable episodes in the history of the Honourable Company. One Company servant, Robert Bird, had gone so far as to produce an anonymously published book entitled <i>Dacoitee in</i> <i>Excelsis, or the Spoliation of Oude by the East India Company</i><sup>24</sup> In it Bird, an insider in all that had happened, exposed the degree to which a largely fictional dossier – eventually published as the parliamentary <i>Oude Blue</i> <i>Book</i> – had been assembled by interested parties within the Company to push for Avadh's annexation. The dossier had depicted a province 'given up to crime, havoc, and anarchy by the misrule of a government at once imbecile and corrupt'. This image, wrote Bird, was little more than 'a fiction of official penmanship, [an] Oriental romance' and was refuted 'by one simple and obstinate fact' – that the people of Avadh clearly 'preferred the slandered regime' of the Nawab 'to the grasping but rose-coloured government of the Company'.</p>",

After a brief introduction praising the Queen for being 'as splendid as the stars' and flattering her Governor General 'as magnificent as Alexander, as splendid as Feridun', Ghalib quickly moved on to the main business: namely reminding the Queen of the long-established convention that sovereigns should support the poets of their dominions in return for being immortalised in verse.</p>",

But it had long been British policy to enlist Hindus from the ritually sensitive higher castes, and particularly those from Avadh, Bihar and the area around Benares. Encouraged to regard themselves as an elite by the British, the northern Indian peasant farmers who became sepoys had grown to become very particular about the preparation and eating of their food, and notions of caste, which in India had traditionally been relatively fluid, underwent a process of hardening, or what some scholars have called 'Sanskritisation', as the sepoys came to understand such issues as being central to their notions of self-respect.*</p>",

According to the author, none of the best potential recruits in the villages now wished to join up with 'an army which may turn into a navy at any point'. There were also, so the officer maintained, great worries that the military profession was losing its status and respectability as the Company was now actively recruiting, and promoting, men of low caste. The Company high command now came to regard such men as less troublesome and ritually oversensitive; but for the existing troops they were 'men we cannot know and whom 1000 of the 1120 people in the village despise', as the officer put it. 'Great as is the Company's name and wealth, it is not so strong as the prejudice of caste.'<sup>49</sup></p>",

Harriet was half his age, and as fluent in Hindustani as her husband. This she had learned as her first language from her ayah during her army childhood, following her father's regiment across the plains of India. Together the two Tytlers pursued their amateur artistic enthusiasms, and – unexpectedly for an army couple – became pioneering photographers, carefully documenting the monuments of Delhi, most of which had never been photographed before.</p>",

In her memoirs Harriet wrote, 'They were very high caste men from Oudh and to make them go by sea to Burma would have caused a mutiny.

He suspected that it was something to do with the weak link in the cable, the section that ran under the Yamuna, which, owing to 'the deterioration in the insulating material with which the cables were constructed, were a source of constant trouble'. Brendish and Pilkington were sent out to check. To their surprise they found that the cable was fine as far as the east bank of the Yamuna, and they had no problem signalling back to Todd from the far bank; the problem clearly lay somewhere towards Meerut. But by this stage it was six o'clock and too late to do anything more that day. So 'Todd made arrangements to go out himself next morning to endeavour to restore communication'.
