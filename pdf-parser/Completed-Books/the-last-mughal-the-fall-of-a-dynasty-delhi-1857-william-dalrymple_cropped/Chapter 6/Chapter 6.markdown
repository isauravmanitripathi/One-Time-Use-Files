## **4 THE NEAR APPROACH OF THE STORM**

Sir Thomas began to suspect that he had been poisoned towards the end of the summer of 1853.

He was not a man who usually suffered from ill health and by sticking to his carefully regulated schedule, by eating in moderation and by rarely going out or staying up late, he made sure he remained fit and well. Then, quite suddenly, at the beginning of the monsoon of 1853, he began to feel horribly sick. The vomiting started soon afterwards. For weeks on end he found he was unable to keep any food down. His daughter Emily was horrified by the speed with which he sank: 'He was looking thin and ill – so white," she wrote after she saw him. 'He continually suffered from sickness – an irritating vomiting of watery stuff. The small pox marks on his face, generally very slight, became more pronounced. It was easy to see he was ill, though he suffered no pain whatever.'<sup>1</sup>

The previous December the whole family had gathered to celebrate a Delhi Christmas amid the roaring wood fires of Metcalfe House. Theo was there, as more unusually was his wife Charlotte, who had chosen to stay on in Simla after her husband was posted to Delhi; it was on this trip to

Metcalfe House that she became pregnant with their first child. Also in the house was Georgina, whose hunger strike had eventually had the desired effect of forcing her father to permit her to correspond with Edward Campbell; shortly afterwards she had accepted Sir Edward's proposal of marriage. To this her father had finally given his consent, to the delight of GG and the relief of all the rest of the family. Georgina's elder sister Emily was in Delhi too, down from Kangra with her new baby Annie and husband Edward, who had just been given one of the most sought-after jobs in the service, that of Commissioner of that cool and beautiful hill region: 'It was a long journey for only one month's leave,' wrote Emily.

But father decided we should go. We had all a most happy meeting there and such a joyous Christmas … Dear Daddy was so proud of his grandchildren and thought 'Motee' Annie [Emily's baby daughter], the most beautiful child he had ever seen and in fact, she was a most lovely babe … There were some other guests in the house and altogether we were a large party, and such a bright happy one. Daddy was so well and in great spirits in having so many of his children around him at once. The weather was glorious with plenty of riding and driving and picnics and dinner parties going on. But alas! It was the last Christmas …<sup>2</sup>

In the course of the celebrations, Sir Thomas had confided the details of his secret agreement with Mirza Fakhru to Emily and her husband:

The officials through whom these negotiations were being carried on were the foreign secretary, Sir Henry Elliot, the Lieutenant Governor, Mr Thomason, and the Resident at Delhi – my Daddy, Sir Thomas … The negotiations had been going on for more than a year and a half, until at last the Heir Apparent agreed to the terms offered … So far matters had gone on more favourably than my father expected, because he knew that there was a powerful clique in the palace, who were straining every nerve to prevent the Heir Apparent giving his adhesion to the proposals of Government. This clique was headed by the Queen – a clever, wicked woman … Her rage, therefore, when she heard that the Heir Apparent had consented to the arrangements was unbounded and she determined

to take her revenge. My father knew her character well, and that she would not let any obstacle stand in the way of her ambition. My Father knew also that her revenge would not stop, and he said to us, 'The first act in the drama is played out – what will be the next?'<sup>3</sup>

Sir Thomas therefore strongly suspected what was happening as his digestion disintegrated in the autumn of 1853 – although, of course, he had no proof; nor was he at all surprised when he heard that Sir Henry Elliot and Mr Thomason were reporting similar symptoms. Despite his illness, however, he was determined to keep his promise to attend GG's wedding in Simla in October, particularly as the trip would also allow him to see Theo's new baby, the future heir to the family baronetcy. He made only one condition. His wife Felicity had died in Simla a decade earlier, on 26 September, and he said he was unwilling to go to the town until the anniversary had passed.

The family began collecting in Theo and Charlotte's house near the church in Simla towards the end of August. GG had been there since the beginning of the hot weather, helping look after her pregnant sister-in-law, and Emily joined them on the 31st, having ridden over from Kangra. A week later, a little prematurely, and before Theo had arrived from his work in Delhi, Charlotte gave birth to a healthy little boy. 'The infant was a fine child and all seemed full of promise for a speedy recovery,' wrote Emily.

She was kept perfectly quiet … when Theo arrived unexpectedly on the eighth day after the Baby's birth. It was a surprise to her – but a great pleasure and both were intensely happy over their boy. On the 9th day, she was moved to a sofa and I went out for an hour, leaving Theo sitting by her side. When I returned home, I was told she had had a shivering fit. She did not seem ill, but from that evening, she seemed to be less and less conscious of what was going on, took less interest in her baby, apparently dozing a great deal, and did not appear to be awake even while taking food.

The doctors looked graver and graver each day, and both looked as shocked as I was to hear her harping on one thing, What day is it? Your mother died on 26th September, did she not? It was the only idea that seemed to fill her thoughts and though in accordance with the doctor's orders we tried to reassure her that that date was

passed, it would not do – 'No,' she said, 'your mother died on that day, and I too shall die on the 26th.'

September 22nd she was so ill that the Holy Communion was administered to her. Theo quite broke down. The next day she lay in a stupor, not turning in her bed and not taking notice of anything… At last the Doctor told Theo to ask if she had any particular wish to express to him or about the baby. She simply shook her head, and Theo thinking she did not understand said – 'Darling, do you not know who I am?' She looked at him with the sweetest smile and said – 'Yes, I know, you are little baby's papa.' Poor Theo! He broke down completely, and had to be taken out of the room, wild with grief.

Then began a series of convulsions which lasted through several hours, and were terrible to witness by those who loved her so dearly. At last, when she was quieter, she turned to me and said – 'Annie don't you hear them?' I said – 'What is it you hear darling?' 'Oh!' she said, 'the angels singing and the harps. I can hear them plainly.' After a little while, in the dead of the night, she turned to me and said – 'Annie, when will be September 26th?' I tried to persuade her by the doctor's orders, that the date was already passed, for they said, this idea fixed in her mind was killing her. But though dead to all else, her mind was clear on that point. After midnight the convulsions began again …

Just as the sun was rising and shining on her bed, she suddenly rose up in her bed and poured forth a song so wild and unearthly, not a word in it – only music – with her face in a rapturous glow that we could only look on in silence and wonder. She had not moved for days, and yet with supernatural strength, she raised herself thus suddenly. Theo rushed to support her with his arm – she took no notice of him, but when her song ceased, she fell back in her bed and never moved again. She died at 3 PM, on September 26th … Dearest Charlotte was buried by my mother's grave in the old cemetery in Simla, on 28th September, 1853. Her loss wrecked dear Theo's life.<sup>4</sup>

The news was taken down to Sir Thomas, who was camping at Kalka on the edge of the plains and at the foot of the road leading up to Simla, waiting for the anniversary of his wife's death to pass. He was now severely ill

himself, pale and drawn and unable to keep down anything more than a thin soup. When the family saw him, they decided to cancel the grand church wedding that had been planned for GG and Edward Campbell, and instead to have a sombre family service in Theo's sitting room. A week later, after the bride and groom departed for their honeymoon in the hills beyond Simla, the now skeletal Sir Thomas set off back to Delhi accompanied by a greiving Theo. They made slow progress. Sir Thomas was now clearly dying. According to Emily,

he suffered no pain, only sank from weakness caused by perpetual vomiting and retching. I followed him as quickly as possible, but on reaching Ambala – I received a message from Theo, that my loved father had died quite peaceably [in Metcalfe House] on November 3rd. The poisons which were undoubtedly used were vegetable [based and] prepared in such a way as to leave no trace behind them. But they do their work, slowly but surely – a secret well known to the famous native hakims.<sup>5</sup>

According to the court diary prepared every day for Sir Thomas, on the final night, a distraught and desperate Theo had sent for Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, Zafar's personal physician, to 'ascertain if possible the disease under which the Agent was suffering'. The hakim had duly driven up to Metcalfe House, but on arrival 'the surgeon in attendance however had observed there was no necessity for consulting him [the hakim] and he had therefore left'.<sup>6</sup> The desperate situation can easily be imagined: Sir Thomas in his death throes; Theo willing to try anything to save his father; Dr Ross refusing to allow in a man he strongly suspected could have been involved in Sir Thomas's demise.

By the end of the year, both Sir Henry Elliot and Mr Thomason were also dead, though as with Sir Thomas there was no hard evidence to show they had been poisoned, other than their suspicious symptoms.<sup>7</sup> As Hakim Ahsanullah Khan boasted to Harriet Tytler when asked many years later if he could poison *ad libitum*, he replied: 'I can. Show me your victim and tell me when you want him to die. In a year? Six months? One month or a day? He shall die, and what is more, your physicians will never find out the real cause of his death.'<sup>8</sup> True or not, the rumours of Metcalfe's poisoning, and

Zinat Mahal's culpability, came to be widely believed in Company circles, and helped make its officials regard the Mughal family with an even more jaundiced eye than before.

Before he died, Sir Thomas had predicted that Mirza Fakhru would not long outlive him. It was therefore something of a surprise to everyone that he lived for nearly two and a half years longer, and that when he died in the prime of his life, on 10 July 1856, it was in fact of cholera, and not of poisoning.

![](_page_5_Picture_2.jpeg)

If anyone in the Palace had hoped that a new Resident would reverse Sir Thomas's policy on the Mughal court, they were soon to be disappointed.

Simon Fraser was a distant kinsman of Ochterlony's old assistant William Fraser, but as different a man as could be imagined: an amiable, pious, plump and somewhat lonely old widower who was fond of singing and whose principal pleasure in life was to organise small musical evenings for his friends. A cousin of the Evangelical East India Company director Charles Grant, who had initially helped him to get a job in India, Fraser agreed on arrival to be the Patron of Padre Jennings' mission: 'Altho' I do not agree with him on many of his opinions,' wrote Fraser, 'he is a good Christian and I have a great regard for him.'<sup>9</sup>

Shortly afterwards Simon Fraser went as far as joining the choir of St James's Church, which was now being organised by Jennings' newly arrived daughter: a pretty, enthusiastic blonde twenty-one-year-old named Annie. Since Annie and her equally attractive friend Miss Clifford had begun to organise the singing, the number of soldiers driving in from the cantonments to attend the lengthy Sunday services at St James's had increased to a remarkable degree, and before long not only was the tenor and bass portion of the choir wonderfully consolidated, but one of the basses, Lieutenant Charlie Thomason of the Bengal Engineers, had succeeded in becoming engaged to the padre's daughter. 10

As with Sir Thomas, Simon Fraser's wife had died young; but unlike Metcalfe, he had never been properly reunited with his children, who had been brought up in English boarding schools and then had chosen to stay on in England, barely even corresponding with their father, except occasionally to ask for money. As he chided his eldest son, 'I have literally no details of your private life. This is no doubt a very unsatisfactory state of affairs but a horror of epistolary correspondence appears to be more or less the characteristic of the members of our family.'<sup>11</sup> When another of his children, the Reverend Simon J. Fraser, was posted to India, Fraser went to meet him, but the two walked past each other without recognition.<sup>12</sup>

Fraser had spent a lifetime in the service of the Company without greatly distinguishing himself in any way. As Delhi was to be his last posting, and he had no further ambitions, he was determined to enjoy himself and make the most of the opportunities this appointment afforded. 'I am very well satisfied with my position,' he wrote to his son Simon in 1854.

Delhi agrees with me and I am shaking off the little ailments which for some time I have suffered from … We have lately been making great exertions [in the choir and] got up a beautiful anthem, appropriate of course to the day. Nothing untoward occurred, and all our church going community expressed themselves highly gratified with the effort. We have one or two very fair performers at this place and I hope that throughout the hot weather I might be able to bring people together every fortnight for a little secular music, although the whole trouble always devolves upon me as master of the ceremonies. Whether the assemblies are at my own house or elsewhere, people become so apathetic that although they will take part in all that you arrange for them, still they will not take the trouble of arranging for themselves, and music cannot be properly got up without practising.<sup>13</sup>

Busy with his choir practice, Fraser had no intention of letting his official duties take up more of his time than they had to, and he spent an entire month in Delhi before bothering to visit the Emperor. He even failed to turn up to the first reception arranged for him by Zafar on 1 December 1853, in the great Mughal garden of Raushanara Bagh. This left Zafar's begums, who had come to camp in the garden for the duration of the welcoming

ceremonies, complaining of the 'extreme cold', while 'several concubines complained that sepoys about the Garden indulged in improper remarks'.<sup>14</sup>

Fraser had announced his forthcoming retirement from the service two days before news came through of the death of Mirza Fakhru, and his response to this new succession crisis bore all the marks of an old man who had had his peaceful slumbers interrupted: 'The surviving sons of the King, have no special marks of nobility, or peculiar recommendations calculated to attract the sympathy of the native population,' he wrote to the new Governor General, Lord Canning, though there is no record that Fraser had actually bothered to meet any of them before running them down to Calcutta.<sup>15</sup>

The day after the death of Mirza Fakhru, he explained in his letter, he had paid a rare visit to the Palace to commiserate with the Emperor. Far from the scene of mourning that might have been expected, he found instead a dry-eyed Emperor with a letter to the Governor General ready written in which he pressed yet again for the succession of Mirza Jawan Bakht; the body of Mirza Fakhru, he heard, had already been interred near the Sufi shrine of Qutb Sahib in Mehrauli. Zafar's letter argued that Jawan Bakht was suitable for the position, on the basis that his birth was legitimate and that he was, in the eyes of his adoring father at least, 'gifted with all the endowments, qualifications and virtuous habits necessary for a Prince, he having obtained a complete education under my guidance. The rest [of my sons] have no comparison with him. He [alone] merits my favour'.<sup>16</sup>

Fraser, however, had other ideas. He strongly urged Canning that none of the princes should be recognised as heir apparent – least of all Jawan Bakht – and argued that the death of Mirza Fakhru, following closely upon the momentous annexation of the rich and independent kingdom of Avadh five months earlier, in February 1856, provided the perfect opportunity to prepare the Mughals for the imminent extinction of their line. This, he believed, should take place on the death of Zafar – an event which could not now be far away: 'It appears to me inexpedient to recognise any of the sons as Heir Apparent,' he concluded. 'The princes generally are not men of prominent influence or high personal character … little public interest is felt in the fortunes of the family and a favourable opportunity is presented, by the removal from the scene of the most respected member of the family, for

the introduction of changes adapted to the altered condition of the family and the Country.'<sup>17</sup>

It was an idea that the new Lieutenant Governor, C.B. Thornhill, wholeheartedly supported. From his summer retreat in the hills of Nainital he wrote to Calcutta urging Canning to listen to Fraser and seize the moment, saying he would 'much regret if advantage were not taken of the favourable and easy opportunity now afforded for introducing a change which while it is obviously fitting in the actual condition of the Indian Empire, [is also] for the best interests of the Princess themselves'. He went on to explain why he believed it was in the best interests of the Mughal princes to be expelled from their homes and for them to have their privy purses – their only source of income – immediately stopped: 'The abolition of the names and forms of royal state will, it may reasonably be hoped, wean them the more readily from the habits of idle, and too often vicious and discreditable frivolities, with which their lives have hitherto been wasted.'

Lord Canning did not hesitate to take the advice offered him. After all, he had arrived in India only five months earlier, to take over from his predecessor Lord Dalhousie. Canning was a handsome, industrious if somewhat reserved Tory politician in his early forties, who had accepted the appointment of Governor General only because of his frustration at his consistent failure to gain a senior cabinet berth in London. Before his departure he had had no previous interest in India, and by July he had yet to leave the heat and damp of Calcutta. Indeed, for almost all of his first few months in India he had found himself imprisoned in the 'miserably furnished' if outwardly magnificent Government House (which, he was horrified to note, did not possess a single water closet, 'there being no fall for drainage in Calcutta', surrounded by his Himalayan piles of dispatch boxes. It was a life he described as 'little better than [that of] a galley slave'.<sup>18</sup>

None of this, however, prevented him from taking a confidently dismissive attitude to 'the farce of Mughal pretensions': 'Nearly all the everyday signs of authority which the native mind associates with royalty have for state reasons already been taken from the Crown of Delhie,' he wrote in a minute in response to Fraser's recommendations.

The presents which were at one time offered to the King by the Governor General and the Commander in Chief have been discontinued; the privilege of a coinage bearing his mark is now denied to him; the Governor General's seal no longer bears a device of vassalage; and even the native chiefs have been prohibited from using one. It has been determined that these appearances of subordination and deference could not be kept up consistently with a due respect for the real and solid power of the British Government. This may also be said of the title of the King of Dehlie,\* with the fiction of paramount sovereignty which attaches to it.<sup>19</sup>

Despite his lack of Indian experience, Canning was quite clear that now was the moment to take the dramatic and historic step of deposing the Mughal dynasty, which had ruled northern India for more than three hundred years: Babur, the first Mughal, took Delhi while Henry VIII was just beginning his rule in England. Britain's Indian Empire, wrote Canning, had never been so strong, so secure or so happy: 'The last few years have seen not only an extension but a remarkable consolidation of British power in India; its supremacy has become more uniform and unbroken even within the earlier limits of the Empire.' For this reason, 'the preservation of a titular King Paramount of Hindustan has thereby grown to be a greater anomaly than ever', and he therefore decided, in agreement with Fraser's views, that no Mughal prince would now be recognised as heir apparent. He concluded, 'The Upper Provinces of India are not now, as they were in 1849 or 1850, in an unsettled and uneasy condition. There is every appearance that the presence of a Royal House in Dehlie has become a matter of indifference even to the Mahometans.'<sup>20</sup>

Given his situation and his recent arrival in India, Canning could not have been expected to know better. But as events were shortly to show, his minute represented as comprehensive a misreading of the situation in northern India as could possibly be contained within a single passage. So removed had the British now become from their Indian subjects, and so dismissive were they of Indian opinion, that they had lost all ability to read the omens around them or to analyse their own position with any degree of accuracy. Arrogance and imperial self-confidence had diminished the desire

to seek accurate information or gain any real knowledge of the state of the country.

More specifically, as far as Delhi was concerned, by extinguishing even the faintest hope of any of the princes of the royal house ever succeeding Zafar, the British created a situation where no one in the imperial family had anything to lose, and all were sufficiently disaffected to risk anything to try to save their position. It was a fatal error for which the British would shortly pay a high price.

![](_page_10_Picture_2.jpeg)

In Delhi, one sign of the growing unrest showed itself only eight months after the death of Mirza Fakhru. Early in the morning on 18 March 1857, a flyer – 'a small dirty piece of paper, with a naked sword and shield depicted', according to Theo – was placed on the back wall of the Jama Masjid in Delhi.<sup>21</sup> Purporting to be a proclamation from the Shah of Iran, it announced that a British expeditionary force had just suffered a massive defeat in Persia, and that the Persian Army had crossed the Afghan border and was now marching from Herat to come and liberate Delhi from Christian rule:

God willing, the time is not far when I shall appear in the land of Hind and shall delight and make happy both the rulers and subjects of that place. Just as the English have deprived them of food and comfort, to the same measure I shall endeavour to increase their prosperity, and let it be known that I have no objections to anyone's religion … By the 6th March, 900 Irani soldiers, along with senior officers will have entered India and there are already five hundred soldiers present in Delhi disguised in dress and appearance … [In the meantime] the Muslims must refrain from helping or supporting the Christians, and it is necessary that so far as possible they should remain loyal and faithful towards their fellow Muslims.<sup>22</sup>

The notice was posted for three hours and a huge crowd gathered to read it, until Theo Metcalfe, who happened to be passing, rode up and ripped it down. The following day, however, the contents of the notice were reprinted in full in the court newspaper, the *Siraj ulAkabhar*, creating a ripple of excitement across the city, although the paper also questioned – rightly – both the veracity of the proclamation and the truth of the claim of a Persian victory over the British.

Already there had been brief reports in the Urdu newspapers of mysterious chapattis (or 'fried puris', as the Delhi papers reported) being passed by nightwatchmen from village to village across Hindustan: one report in the *Nur-i Maghrebi* in February had mentioned their passing between some villages near Bulandshahr; by early March they had reached Mathura, on the main road to Agra. But they do not seem to have got any closer to Delhi than this, and even there no one seems to have understood what their significance was;\* as far as the Delhi papers were concerned, it was certainly a matter given far less space than the reports of a fatwa being posted in Madras, 'calling on all believers to rise against the infidels … he who fell in such a war would be a martyr', and the excitable rumours that either the Russians or the Persian Army, or possibly both, were on the march and about to appear in Delhi. Most prominent of all were reports, which began to appear from late March onwards, of unrest in the army in Bengal, especially at Berhampore and Barrackpore: according to Theo, by the spring of 1857, the people of Delhi 'were perfectly aware of the want of fidelity in the sepoy army and the subject was frequently discussed'.<sup>23</sup>

This growing unrest in Delhi could be traced back at least to the previous winter when, on 7 February 1856, the British had unilaterally annexed the prosperous kingdom of Avadh (or Oudh, as the British called it), to the east of Delhi. The excuse for this was that its Nawab, the poet, dancer and epicure Wajd Ali Shah, was 'excessively debauched'.\* The people of Delhi were used to the British bullying and plundering the Nawabs as they had done for nearly a century now; but the outright annexation of the kingdom had nevertheless caused far more alarm across northern India than the British seem to have realised or indeed anticipated, and increased awareness of the precariousness of the Mughals' own position. More importantly, it greatly unsettled the sepoys of the Company's army, most of whom were drawn from uppercaste Hindu families in rural

Avadh, and who now found themselves compelled to reduce their own country to vassalage.

The venal and occasionally brutal way the annexation had been carried out caused particular distress. Even British officials were aware that what had happened was not one of the more honourable episodes in the history of the Honourable Company. One Company servant, Robert Bird, had gone so far as to produce an anonymously published book entitled *Dacoitee in Excelsis, or the Spoliation of Oude by the East India Company*<sup>24</sup> In it Bird, an insider in all that had happened, exposed the degree to which a largely fictional dossier – eventually published as the parliamentary *Oude Blue Book* – had been assembled by interested parties within the Company to push for Avadh's annexation. The dossier had depicted a province 'given up to crime, havoc, and anarchy by the misrule of a government at once imbecile and corrupt'. This image, wrote Bird, was little more than 'a fiction of official penmanship, [an] Oriental romance' and was refuted 'by one simple and obstinate fact' – that the people of Avadh clearly 'preferred the slandered regime' of the Nawab 'to the grasping but rose-coloured government of the Company'.

Bird pointed out, in particular, 'that those who had experience of both [governments], to the number of some 50,000 employed as sepoys by the Company', felt and resented the difference in the two regimes especially strongly:

Not only does the annexation itself appear to have been accompanied by acts of violence and spoliation wholly indefensible, but the foundation of all property seems to have been unsettled to an extent unheard of under any civilised rule. We hear on all sides of landowners dispossessed – in short of the Company dealing with the province as if it were not merely entitled to the revenues of it, but as if all the property within it had become the spoil of its bow and spear; as if, in fact, it was an uninhabited island newly discovered with which the discoverers had a right to do what they willed.<sup>25</sup>

Already many smaller kingdoms had been quietly – and profitably – annexed by the Company. The policy of Governor General Dalhousie (1812–60), known as the Doctrine of Lapse, had banned the age-old Hindu

practice of adopted sons succeeding to their father's throne, and led to the unpopular and deeply resented annexations of Satara in 1848, Jhansi in 1853 and Nagpur in 1854; but Avadh was an acquisition on a far different scale from anything yet attempted, and was practised on 'a faithful and unresisting ally' without even the nominal justification of the absence of a recognised heir, and with only the 'fictitious charges' and 'fallacious bearings of the *Oude Blue Book*' as an excuse.<sup>26</sup>

![](_page_13_Picture_1.jpeg)

After the annexation of Avadh and the death of Mirza Fakhru, the end of the Mughal line was clearly imminent.

For Zafar, now aged eighty-one, it was a particular shock. He had long made it clear that he had no wish for anything other than to preserve and hand on what little he had inherited. As early as 1843 he had attempted to write direct to Queen Victoria, asking for this bare minimum: 'From unfortunate circumstances', he wrote,

the flower of my kingdom has faded, and the dominion of this house is placed in your hands … to diminish or enhance its dignity … I am now old, and have no ambition left for grandeur. I would devote my days entirely to religion, but I feel anxious that the name and dignity of my predecessors should be maintained, and that they may descend to my children unimpaired, according to the original engagements made by the British Government.<sup>27</sup>

Now, with the example of Avadh in front of him, Zafar set his sights much lower. His first action on hearing of the annexation of Avadh was to write a series of anxious begging letters to Dalhousie, saying that as the 'days of our pilgrimage on Earth are numbered … [and] as no reliance can be placed in one's life at the advanced age of 80 years, we have been of late engaged in reflecting on the future welfare of our family, especially of the Nawab Zinat Mahal Begum and her offspring, the Prince Mirza Jawan Bakht Bahadur, that no distress or hardships be experienced by them'. Zafar asked

only for a guarantee that both would be looked after following his death. Yet Dalhousie's response was, characteristically, both dismissive and ungenerous; he got one of his secretaries to reply that 'the grants which your Majesty has made to the Begums and Prince your Majesty must be sensible cannot be upheld; they may be maintained during your Majesty's own lifetime, but cannot now be extended beyond that; for this would be contrary to former practice'.<sup>28</sup>

Zafar was not alone in his alarm. The demise of the Mughal and his court was something that could only cast a cloud over the whole of Delhi, much of whose prosperity and patronage derived directly or indirectly from the Red Fort. With the end of the Mughals, many in the city would find themselves out of a job: the courtiers and Palace civil servants, the jewellers and silversmiths, the cooks and palanquin bearers, the guards and eunuchs, the musicians and the dancing girls. None of these could expect employment under British rule, whose administrators for the North West Provinces were anyway based 150 miles to the south in Agra.

It also boded extremely badly for the court poets: 'Although I am a stranger to Avadh and its affairs,' wrote Ghalib on 23 February 1856, 'the destruction of the state depresses me all the more, and I maintain that no Indian who was not devoid of all sense of justice could feel otherwise.'<sup>29</sup> Ghalib had received a small pension from the Nawab which he lost at the annexation in February; with the death of his pupil in poetry, Mirza Fakhru, in July, his income was further reduced: 'You must bear in mind', he wrote to a friend on 27 July 1856,

that the death of the heir apparent has been a great blow to me. It means that my ties with the court will now last only as long as the king does. God knows who the new heir apparent will be. He who appreciated my worth has died. Who will recognise me now? I put my trust in my Creator, and resign myself to His will. And there is this immediate loss: he [Mirza Fakhru] used to give me ten rupees a month to buy fruit for my [two adopted] boys. Who will give me that now?<sup>30</sup>

Ghalib, like many writers before and since, suffered from the potentially combustible combination of expensive tastes, a keen sense of his own worth

and insufficient financial resources to support either. Always precarious, his finances had become especially troubled after his sense of personal honour compelled him to turn down the lucrative chance to become the Persian Professor at Delhi College. Ghalib had arrived at Delhi College in his palanquin having being invited to apply for the new post. But after reaching the college gate, he refused to enter until Mr Thomason, the secretary, came and welcomed him, as he insisted his aristocratic status dictated. After a long stand-off, Mr Thomason

came out personally and explained that a formal welcome was appropriate when he attended the Governor's durbar, but not in the present case, when he came as a candidate for employment. Ghalib replied, 'I contemplated taking a government appointment in the expectation that this would bring me greater honour than I now receive, not a reduction in those already accorded to me.' The secretary replied, 'I am bound by regulations.' 'Then I hope you will excuse me,' Ghalib said, and came away. 31

In such a situation, it was an increasing irritation to Ghalib that Zafar did not value him more highly, and instead bestowed most of his favour, and the bounteous pension that went with it, on that obvious second-rater Zauq. It was something Ghalib could never understand, as he was once bold enough to point out to Zafar: 'I swear that you too must feel pride', he wrote,

in the great kindness of fortune, that you possess a slave like Ghalib, whose song has all the power of fire. Turn your attention towards me as my skill demands, treasure me as the apple of your eye and open your heart for me to enter in… See my perfection, look upon my skill … Why talk of the poets of the Emperor Akbar's day? My presence alone bears witness that your age excels his.<sup>32</sup>

When Zauq died in 1854, Zafar finally appointed Ghalib as his *ustad* (guru or master, but in this case poetry teacher), with the salary that went with it, and Ghalib (at least according to Delhi tradition) was able to breathe a sigh of relief that 'the man who spoke in the language of a lodging house keeper' was no more.<sup>33</sup> Insufficient as Zafar's regard for Ghalib's skills

may have been, the court still represented a financial lifeline Ghalib depended on. As early as 1852, when the King had been ill, Ghalib had written anxiously: 'What will happen now? And what will become of me, who sleeps in the shade of his wall?'<sup>34</sup> A little later he added, 'The Mughal princes gather in the Red Fort and recite their ghazals … This court will not last many days more. How can it be permanent? Who knows if they will meet tomorrow, and if they do whether they will meet after that? The assembly can vanish at any moment.'<sup>35</sup>

One reason for Ghalib's pessimism was that, unlike many in Delhi, he had always been aware of the scientific advances achieved by the West, which he had seen on display on a visit to Calcutta in 1827. When Sayyid Ahmad Khan tried to interest him in writing an introduction to an edition of the *Ain i-Akbari*, the celebrated account of the court of the Emperor Akbar, Ghalib had written back that Khan should not always be looking back to the Mughals of old, but should embrace the future: 'See the sahibs of England!' he wrote.

They have gone far ahead of our Oriental forebears. Wind and wave they have rendered useless. They are sailing their ships under fire and steam. They are creating music without the use of the *mizrab* [plucker]. With their magic, words fly through the air like birds. Air has been set on fire … Cities are being lighted without oil lamps. This new law makes all other laws obsolete. Why must you pick up straws out of old time-swept barns while a treasure trove of pearls lies at your feet?<sup>36</sup>

Now, after the death of Mirza Fakhru and the annexation of Avadh, Ghalib thought it prudent to take immediate steps to look for other sources of income, while also teaching the English the courtly manners they so clearly lacked. To this end he forwarded a Persian ode or *qasida* to Queen Victoria via Canning. After a brief introduction praising the Queen for being 'as splendid as the stars' and flattering her Governor General 'as magnificent as Alexander, as splendid as Feridun', Ghalib quickly moved on to the main business: namely reminding the Queen of the long-established convention that sovereigns should support the poets of their dominions in return for being immortalised in verse.

As the great Begum of London was clearly not as familiar with the delicate etiquette of these matters as she should have been, Ghalib made himself a little more explicit in his covering letter. The truly great rulers of history, he reminded Queen Victoria, 'rewarded their poets and well wishers by filling their mouths with pearls, weighing them in gold, and granting them villages and recompense'. In the same way it was the duty of 'the exalted Queen to bestow upon Ghalib, the petitioner, the title of *Mihr-Khwan*, and present him with the robe of honour and a few crumbs from her bounteous table – that is, in plain English, a "pension"<sup>37</sup>

Ghalib waited eagerly for the Queen's grateful response, and her gift of a generous stipend. It never came; but this ode would soon perform the far more important function of helping to save his life.

If Ghalib found himself deeply anxious and depressed as 1856 gave way to 1857, then Theo Metcalfe was also in a very bad state.

After the sudden loss of his wife and his father, he tried to throw himself into his work and to soldier on as Joint Magistrate in Delhi. But the stress of bringing up his child on his own, and the depressing job of selling his father's library, as well as much of the other contents of Metcalfe House, all weighed down on him. He clung to his son as a last memory of his wife: 'I never can part with him,' he wrote to GG early in 1856. 'Altho' I feel the great disadvantage of leaving him many hours alone everyday, without the company of a lady, I do try to show him an affection which I never experienced when a child, the loss of which I always mourned.'<sup>38</sup>

As 1856 progressed, however, the stress of his mental state began to have an adverse physical effect on him, and especially on his eyes. 'You will be sorry to hear that I have been suffering greatly from pain and weakness in my left eye for months,' he finally admitted to GG in August 1856 from Meerut,

which has necessitated the abandonment of all use of it and has compelled me to give up work for a period of three months … It is quite possible that even this rest may not be quite sufficient for its perfect recovery … I am ordered to live in a dark room so that I have no very cheering prospects before me; at present to go to Delhi to put all our father's things [in Metcalfe House] in order. If I find that my eye is stronger at the end of a month, I propose taking a trip to the hills … Do you know any widow who wants to take care of a single gentleman, for I am comparatively helpless and am forbidden all reading or writing.<sup>39</sup>

Georgina, who was summering in Kashmir, immediately offered to look after Charlie, Theo's son. Theo reluctantly, but gratefully, agreed. Soon after ripping down the flyer from the walls of the Jama Masjid, he wrote to his brother-in-law, Edward Campbell, repeating how much he needed a holiday, and that with luck, in May 1857, he would be able to join him and GG in the hills: 'I cannot account for this numbness of feeling that weighs me down and makes me helpless,' he wrote sadly to Edward. 'I think without a relief from all work, without a long and perfect holiday, I will never rise.'<sup>40</sup>

Edward was less sympathetic than GG to Theo's plight. Following the departure from India of his patron, Sir Charles Napier, to whom he had been ADC at headquarters in Fort William, Calcutta, Campbell's career had floundered. He and his company of the 60th Rifles were now employed in the far from prestigious or lucrative job of surveying the area around Multan on the Punjab-Sindh border, reputedly the hottest place in the entire subcontinent; it was certainly a far cry from the luxuries of Fort William. To hear how much of his meagre income was now being eaten up by Theo's baby and nanny made him furious: 'I am very much vexed with Theo,' he wrote to GG in Kashmir.

About the rent, I think there is no use asking him, and not the slightest in giving hints for he *will not* take them. I think we might just make out a little memo, showing him the actual expense we were put to by having Mrs Baxter and Charlie boarded on us, and then ask him to pay. 41

But Campbell had other worries that were causing rather more irritation than his lack of money and his insensitive brother-in-law. For the army had just put him in charge of training the troops in the Punjab with their latest and most advanced new armament: 'I am deep in all sorts of regimental affairs,' he explained to GG,

and am taking a leading part as concerns the management of the new Enfield rifles. Our fellows don't like them as much as the old ones. I think they will, but at present do not see how. It is a disfavourable circumstance because we cannot afford to unload and clean them as often as we would wish. We have so little ammunition … and after firing a few rounds, they get very foul and hard to load.<sup>42</sup>

Edward didn't trouble his wife with the technical details, but the problem with the new Enfield guns was that, unlike their predecessors, the smoothbarrelled Brown Bess muskets, they had grooved (or rifled) barrels. While this made them much more accurate and gave them a longer range, it did mean they were more difficult to load, and in order to get the ball down the barrel, quantities of grease were needed, as well as a great deal of pushing with the ramrod. The drill Edward had to teach his troops involved biting off the top of the cartridge, pouring the powder into the rifle, then stuffing the ball and the rest of the fatty cartridge down after it with the rod.<sup>43</sup>

This was all new technology, however, and the Company had decided, unwisely, to have the cartridges manufactured at the Dumdum arsenal in Calcutta, which had no previous experience of manufacturing this type of ammunition. As a result there were inevitably teething problems, in particular with the first few batches of Dumdum-manufactured cartridges, which seemed to have been coated with far too much grease. This had two results. First, as Edward wrote to GG, it meant that the barrels quickly fouled up with the excess fat, and needed frequent cleaning.<sup>44</sup> The second problem was that the greasy coating of the cartridge was deeply unpleasant to put in your mouth, and biting became thoroughly repellent to any rifleman.

It was into this fertile soil that a rumour quickly took root: that the quantities of grease used were not only unpleasant, they were actually

defiling, and made from a mixture of cow fat (offensive to the majority of sepoys, who were high-caste and vegetarian Hindus, and who would also be extremely upset at having to touch anything that had caused suffering to the much-revered cow) and pig fat (an unclean animal to both Hindus and Muslims and so offensive to just about all sepoys).

The rumours do seem to have been based on truth: initially, the unpleasant grease had indeed been made from these defiling ingredients, as Lord Canning later admitted.<sup>45</sup> The ingredients of the grease were quickly changed, and in many cases the sepoys were allowed to make up their own lubricant of beeswax and ghee, clarified butter. But the damage was done. It was not just that most of the sepoys totally refused to touch the new rifles. More dangerously still, the idea quickly gained acceptance that the mistake was far from accidental and was part of a wider Company conspiracy to break the sepoys' caste and ritual purity before embarking on a project of mass conversion.

The rumours were given some genuine credibility by the crassly tactless activities of the missionaries and their supporters among the Evangelicals of the army and administration. Had the Company chosen to recruit their sepoy armies from the lower castes this would possibly have been less important. But it had long been British policy to enlist Hindus from the ritually sensitive higher castes, and particularly those from Avadh, Bihar and the area around Benares. Encouraged to regard themselves as an elite by the British, the northern Indian peasant farmers who became sepoys had grown to become very particular about the preparation and eating of their food, and notions of caste, which in India had traditionally been relatively fluid, underwent a process of hardening, or what some scholars have called 'Sanskritisation', as the sepoys came to understand such issues as being central to their notions of self-respect.\*

To make matters worse, and the situation even more combustible, the army was already on the verge of mutiny over quite separate – and more secular – issues of pay and regulations. One of the first among the senior officers to realise this was Edward Campbell's old boss, Sir Charles Napier, who had resigned as Commander-in-Chief in 1850, specifically because his growing worries that British India was in 'great peril' from the unrest among its own sepoys were comprehensively ignored by Lord Dalhousie. 'There is no justification for the cry that India is in danger,' wrote Dalhousie in answer to a written report of Napier's. 'Free from all threat of

hostilities from without, and secure, through the submission of its new subjects, from insurrection within, the safety of India has never for one moment been imperilled by the partial insubordination in the ranks of its army.'<sup>46</sup>

Having been close to Napier, and so aware of the extent of the discontent, Edward Campbell was quick to realise the danger that this new threat posed. There were, after all, already very many good reasons for the extreme unhappiness of the sepoys. Many sons of established sepoy families in Hindustan now found themselves refused jobs in the army as the Company was busy filling its ranks with Gurkhas and Sikhs, whose fighting skills had come to impress the British during the closely fought Gurkha and Sikh wars of the early and mid nineteenth century. And for those who could get positions, there was little chance of promotion: even after years of gallant and faithful service, no Indian could rise above the ranks of subahdar (or officer, of whom there were ten to a regiment) or subahdarmajor (senior officer, one per regiment); real authority remained entirely with the British.<sup>47</sup>

Moreover, the British officers, who once mixed with their men – and not infrequently cohabited with the men's sisters – had become increasingly distant, rude and dismissive. Gone were the days of the White Mughals, who used to join their men wrestling or dancing in the lines, and who used to send ahead to the next village on a march to have the best chess player ready and waiting. According to Sitaram Pandey, a sepoy who wrote his memoirs after 1857,

In those days the sahibs could speak our language much better than they do now, and they mixed more with us. Although officers today have to pass the language examination, and have to read books, they do not understand our language … the Sahibs used to give nautches [dance displays] for the regiment, and they attended all men's games. They took us with them when they went out hunting. Now they seldom attend nautches as their Padre Sahibs have told them it is wrong. These Padre Sahibs have done, and are still doing, many things to estrange British officers from their sepoys. When I was a sepoy the captain of my company would have some men at his house all day and he talked with them … I have lived to see great changes in the Sahibs' attitudes towards us. I know that many

officers nowadays only speak to their men when obliged to do so, and they show that the business is irksome and try to get rid of the sepoys as quickly as possible. One sahib told us he never knew what to say to us. The sahibs always knew what to say, and how to say it, when I was a young soldier. 48

To add to their unhappiness, the relative value of the sepoys' pay had seriously declined – valuable perks such as free postage and an extra wartime allowance called *bhatta* had been slowly whittled away – yet conditions of service were now more demanding than ever: around the same time as the Company annexed Avadh, the home of many of the sepoys, it had also passed the hugely unpopular General Service Enlistment Act, which required that all sepoys should be prepared to serve abroad. Since 'Crossing the Black Water' was forbidden to orthodox high-caste Hindus, this only went further to confirm the fears of the sepoys that the Company was actively conspiring to take away their status and their religion.

In May 1855 a long article was published in the *Delhi Gazette* purporting to have been written by 'an old sepoy officer just invalided and settled in my village for the remainder of my days', but which in fact was almost certainly penned by an English officer. According to the author, none of the best potential recruits in the villages now wished to join up with 'an army which may turn into a navy at any point'. There were also, so the officer maintained, great worries that the military profession was losing its status and respectability as the Company was now actively recruiting, and promoting, men of low caste. The Company high command now came to regard such men as less troublesome and ritually oversensitive; but for the existing troops they were 'men we cannot know and whom 1000 of the 1120 people in the village despise', as the officer put it. 'Great as is the Company's name and wealth, it is not so strong as the prejudice of caste.'<sup>49</sup>

![](_page_22_Picture_3.jpeg)

One very strong candidate for the authorship of the *Delhi Gazette* piece was Captain Robert Tytler.

Tytler was a veteran of the 38th Native Infantry, and an officer of the old school who was close to his sepoys, concerned for their well-being, and completely fluent in Hindustani. Tytler appears to have been a kind and sensitive man, a widower with two little children who had recently remarried, this time to the brisk and resilient Harriet. Harriet was half his age, and as fluent in Hindustani as her husband. This she had learned as her first language from her ayah during her army childhood, following her father's regiment across the plains of India. Together the two Tytlers pursued their amateur artistic enthusiasms, and – unexpectedly for an army couple – became pioneering photographers, carefully documenting the monuments of Delhi, most of which had never been photographed before.

Several years earlier, during the Second Anglo-Burmese War, Tytler's regiment had been ordered to cross the sea to Rangoon by Dalhousie – 'a very obstinate Scotchman', according to Harriet. Tytler had been mortified by the dilemma this presented to his sepoys. In her memoirs Harriet wrote, 'They were very high caste men from Oudh and to make them go by sea to Burma would have caused a mutiny. What they should have done was to ask for volunteers … My husband said, "I know my men will never go if ordered, but if the Government would only ask them to volunteer, they would go to a man."'

Tytler was ignored, and the order to sail was given. The response from the sepoys was that they would go, but not by sea. As a punishment, the entire regiment was ordered by Dalhousie to march, by land, not to Rangoon but to Dacca, one of the most unhealthy postings in India; within five months all but three men in the entire regiment either were dead or had been hospitalised. In Harriet's view, 'it was most unChristianlike to wish these poor men, who had only upheld their religious rights, to go where they were to die like dogs'.<sup>50</sup>

Understanding and sympathising with his sepoys' religious feelings, Tytler was therefore extremely anxious when his sepoys began to hear the rumours about the new Enfield rifle and asked him about the truth of them. By the spring of 1857 none had yet been issued to the troops stationed in the Delhi cantonments, but orders duly came that two companies from each of the regiments stationed in Delhi should be sent to Ambala, 100 miles up the Grand Trunk Road, for training with the new guns. 'Our men marched to that station,' wrote Harriet, 'and though before leaving Delhi they evinced some insubordination, still the officers hoped it would pass off as

soon as they saw we had no desire to destroy their caste and turn them into Christians.'51 The hope was quickly disappointed.

Bulletins kept coming in from Ambala to the Brigadier stating the great dissatisfaction the men were showing to the use of the Enfield rifle and its greased cartridge, and my husband often said to me, 'if our natives were to rebel against us, India is lost.' He really became very anxious as days went on and symptoms of disaffection were showing themselves everywhere.<sup>52</sup>

The signs of disaffection were certainly becoming more and more apparent. On 29 March at Barrackpore in Bengal, one sepoy named Mangal Pandey called upon his fellow sepoys to rise up, and shot and wounded two officers; he was promptly tried and hanged. Soon afterwards in Ambala, so Tytler learned, the earnest requests of the British officers for the new rifles to be withdrawn were ignored by the Commander-in-Chief, General George Anson, a gambling man renowned as 'the best whist player in Europe', who had won the 1842 Derby with a horse he had bought for only £120.<sup>53</sup> His touch with his sepoys was, however, less sure than his feel for racehorses: 'I will never give into their beastly prejudices,' Anson said, when told that the troops were on the verge of mutiny. <sup>54</sup> As a result, from that evening until May, the Ambala cantonments were hit by a wave of arson attacks; meanwhile any sepoy who bit the cartridges – including those from the Delhi regiments – was made outcaste by his fellows and taunted as a Christian. 'Feeling is as bad as can be,' wrote the commander of the depot, Captain E. M. Martineau,

and matters have gone so far that I can hardly devise any suitable remedy … I know that at the present moment an unusual agitation is pervading the ranks of the entire native army, but what exactly it will result in I am afraid to say. I can detect the near approach of the storm, I can hear the moaning of the hurricane, but I can't say how, when or where it will break forth … I don't think they know themselves what they will do, or that they have any plan of action except resistance of invasion of their religion, and their faith.<sup>55</sup>

By the end of April the trouble had spread to Meerut, where the 3rd Light Infantry also refused to fire the cartridge. The ringleaders were arrested, and at the end of the first week of May, Tytler's subahdar-major and close friend, Mansur Ali, travelled up from Delhi to sit as President of the Court Martial. Before he went he told Robert, '"Sir if I find these men guilty, I will give them the severest punishment in my power.'

He was true to his word. On 9 May, Mansur Ali duly sentenced no fewer than eighty-five sepoys of the regiment to ten years' penal servitude. That evening placards were seen in the Meerut bazaar calling on all true Musalmans to rise up and slaughter the Christians.<sup>56</sup>

The tenth day of May 1857 dawned suffocatingly hot and dusty in Delhi: it was now reaching the peak of the summer heat, and 1857 had proved an even hotter and drier year than usual.

As was their habit, the Tytlers drove down from the cantonments to the morning service at St James's, and on the way met one of their brother officers, who had just returned from the rifle training in Ambala. 'My husband called out, "Well Burrowes what about the men?" His reply was, "Oh they are all right now Tytler, and are on their way back."'

Robert, however, remained worried and alert. That evening he heard the 'tootooing of the *dak gharree* [post carriage] bugle in the [sepoy] lines, a very unusual thing for native soldiers never travel in a *dak gharree*. My husband came to the conclusion it must be Mansur Ali, our subahdar-major returning from the court martial. Presently the bearer came back to say Mansur Ali had not returned, but some men from Meerut had come to see their friends in the lines. My husband thought it was a strange thing, but never gave the matter any serious consideration.'<sup>57</sup>

Tytler was not the only person in Delhi to notice odd happenings connected with Meerut. On their drive to church, the Tytlers would have passed the city telegraph office, which was situated in the Civil Lines outside Kashmiri Gate. Inside, Charles Todd and his two young assistants,

Brendish and Pilkington, were chatting with their friends in the Meerut telegraph office. There was great excitement and unrest in that town, they heard, due to the sentences that had just been given out. At nine o'clock both offices closed for the hottest part of the day.

When Todd returned at 4 p.m., at the end of his siesta, he found that communication with Meerut had been severed. He suspected that it was something to do with the weak link in the cable, the section that ran under the Yamuna, which, owing to 'the deterioration in the insulating material with which the cables were constructed, were a source of constant trouble'. Brendish and Pilkington were sent out to check. To their surprise they found that the cable was fine as far as the east bank of the Yamuna, and they had no problem signalling back to Todd from the far bank; the problem clearly lay somewhere towards Meerut. But by this stage it was six o'clock and too late to do anything more that day. So 'Todd made arrangements to go out himself next morning to endeavour to restore communication'. He then closed the office and went off back to his bungalow to have his dinner. 58

As Todd was closing the office, George and Elizabeth Wagen-trieber were riding past it on their way back from Jennings' evening service. That night, they had a visitor. More unusually, it was a prominent Delhi nobleman, Zia ud-Din Khan, the Nawab of Loharu, a cousin of Ghalib whose father had been a business partner and great friend of Elizabeth's father, James Skinner. According to their daughter Julia, George and Elizabeth sat huddled in earnest conversation with the Nawab on the veranda, but

as I seldom went out to native visitors, I walked in at once and did not come out again. But when he had gone they spoke of some words of warning which he had been given about the troopers at Meerut being put in prison, that 'it was not wise policy and the Government would be sorry for it.' They thought it right to inform Sir T Metcalfe [Theo] of the Nawab's hints and my father sent him a letter that night.<sup>59</sup>

Theo, however, was otherwise engaged in packing for his holidays: he was due to leave on his journey to join GG and his son Charlie in Kashmir early the following morning, and he was too exhausted and depressed to act on the letter that night.

While the Nawab was visiting the Wagentriebers, another letter was given to Simon Fraser as he stepped out of the evening service at St James's. But it was a Sunday, and Fraser's mind was no doubt still on his beloved weekly performance with the choir. Whatever the reason, he put the envelope in his pocket and did not remember it until the following morning.<sup>60</sup>

The letter, which Fraser finally opened and read over his breakfast, was a warning that the sepoys had finally decided to rise up in Meerut, and that they intended to massacre the entire Christian population of the station on Sunday evening. Fraser was horrified and called for his buggy to take immediate action; but by then, of course, it was too late.

The Meerut sepoys had not only risen and committed a massacre, they had also ridden south-eastwards throughout the night, and at that very moment were pouring over the Bridge of Boats, and into the walled city, in search of their Emperor.
