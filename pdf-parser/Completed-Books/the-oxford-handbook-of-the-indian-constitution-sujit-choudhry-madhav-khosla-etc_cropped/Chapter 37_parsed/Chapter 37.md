# **PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION**

### SHYAM DIVAN

### **I. INTRODUCTION**

BUILT in dark basalt, the Bombay High Court rises at the edge of the Oval *maidan*. <sup>1</sup> Here, on 22 October 1975, Jayantilal Gandhi J commenced dictating his oral judgment in the *Backbay* case. <sup>2</sup> The task continued over several weeks and eventually ended 953 pages later with the judge substantially allowing the petition. The lead petitioner, Piloo Mody, an architect and Member of Parliament, was President of the Swatantra Party. The co-petitioner, Mrinal Gore, was a member of the Maharashtra Legislature. The petitioners, residents of Bombay, were concerned about haphazard development in a recently reclaimed portion of the city known as Backbay Reclamation. They complained that the government, acting at the bidding of Chief Minister VP Naik and two other ministers, had allotted prime real estate to preferred builders in a secretive manner at an undervalued price.<sup>3</sup> The respondents sought dismissal. They argued that the petitioners lacked legal standing, the allotments were contractual and beyond the Court's power of judicial review, and the process adopted was of no concern to anyone other than the government itself, which had acted in good faith.

With few precedents to guide him, Gandhi J upheld the standing of the petitioners. As citizens, they had an interest in the development of their city. Where the disposal of government property was 'arbitrary and capricious' and important constitutional questions were involved, 'no injustice can be tolerated and technical plea of *locus standi* will not come in the way of the court exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226'.<sup>4</sup> Ministers occupy a position analogous to trustees and they were bound to dispose of resources for the benefit of the State, not for the benefit of private persons. Judicial review was available to ensure that ministers did not arbitrarily and capriciously dispose of government property. There was a public duty on the State and its officials to ascertain the market price before disposing of the land.

Gandhi J found that the State and its ministers had acted with reckless negligence in allotting plots without a public auction or due publicity and without ascertaining the correct market price.<sup>5</sup> Having struck a blow for government accountability, the judge crafted an ingenious order. While asserting jurisdiction to direct the private builders to return possession to the State, the judge preferred a pragmatic resolution. He allowed the builders to retain their plots, provided they agreed to undo the gross undervaluation by paying the exchequer a further one-third of the allotment value.<sup>6</sup> In this manner, the High Court staked out an expanded oversight turf, declared valuable principles for improved governance, and issued remedial directions that were accepted by all the parties. <sup>7</sup> *Backbay* with its heady mix of politicians, builders, and a scam was closely reported in newspapers. $\frac{8}{5}$  It is amongst the earliest cases where judicial review was exercised in the public interest to enhance government accountability.<sup>9</sup> By lowering the standing threshold, articulating a quasi-trustee standard for the exercise of all government power, and fashioning a resolution that was prospective and ameliorative, *Backbay* anticipated the robust administrative law and public interest litigation (PIL)

jurisprudence developed by the Supreme Court in later years.<sup>10</sup>

Front and centre, PIL now occupies an unrivalled space in Indian constitutional law that bridges the citizen, the court, and the State. It arose in response to citizens seeking to curb widespread human rights violations or illegalities in government functioning that harmed public administration or the environment. Despair over an apathetic executive with no real possibility of near-term improvements spurred both litigant and judge to fix a broken system. How did PIL jurisprudence expand this swiftly? The Supreme Court, anxious to restore its prestige in the wake of the Emergency, stretched traditional doctrine so that judges could reach out and assist the destitute whose existence was forgotten by a callous State. The result of this extended oversight was to redefine public law. Matters traditionally considered within the exclusive sphere of the executive or the legislature are now debated in court. The Supreme Court has shifted from being a mere constitutional or appellate court to an institution of governance. PIL has become a vehicle of choice for those seeking redress of public grievances. Rather than pursuing elected representatives or public officials in the hope of governance reforms, a strategic judicial intervention mandating government action is simpler, cheaper, and possibly quicker. Amongst several difficult options to improve governance, activists view PILs as the least bad. PILs are a new way to work a democratic constitution. While a large part of PIL activity takes place in the High Courts, particularly with respect to local issues, the warp and weft of PIL jurisprudence was provided by the Supreme Court. In this chapter, while acknowledging the High Courts' contribution, we focus on the Supreme Court.

#### **II. CHARACTERISTICS**

PILs are a type of judicial business carried out by the High Courts and the Supreme Court in the exercise of their writ jurisdictions under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution. $\frac{11}{1}$  In contrast to private dispute adjudications affecting individual rights, PILs deal with public grievances such as flagrant human rights violations by the State or seek to vindicate the public policies embodied in statutes or constitutional provisions.<sup>12</sup> Early in PIL's evolution, the Supreme Court explained the scope of this nascent field:

Public Interest Litigation, as we conceive it, is essentially a cooperative or collaborative effort on the part of the petitioner, the State or public authority and the court to secure observance of the constitutional or legal rights, benefits and privileges conferred upon the vulnerable sections of the community and to reach social justice to them.<sup>13</sup>

In a PIL, the focus dictates the principal features of the litigation. Since the litigation is not strictly adversarial, the scope of the controversy is flexible. Parties and officials may be joined as the litigation unfolds; and new and unexpected issues may emerge to dominate the case. The orientation of the case is prospective. The petitioner seeks to prevent an egregious state of affairs or an illegitimate policy from continuing into the future. Because the relief sought is corrective rather than compensatory, it is not shaped as an injunction or monetary award in the traditional sense. It does not always derive logically from the right asserted. Instead, it is fashioned for the special purpose of the case, sometimes by a quasi-negotiating process between the court and the responsible agencies. It is difficult to delimit the duration and effect of PIL. The parties often return to the court for fresh directions and orders and, in many situations, the court's anxiety to view tangible results persuades the judge to retain *seisin* over a case and monitor implementation. Finally, because the relief is

sometimes directed against government policies, it may have an impact that extends beyond the parties in the case. In view of these features, judges play a large role in organising and shaping the litigation and in supervising the implementation of relief. This activist role of the PIL judge contrasts with the passive umpireship traditionally associated with judicial functions. $\frac{14}{1}$  As the characteristics make it easy to see, the litigation landscape was transformed with the advent of PIL in India. The orthodox bilateral dispute yielded space in the dockets of the constitutional courts to a polycentric, problem-solving exercise, often with a strong legislative flavour in terms of sweep, policy content, and reformative focus.<sup>15</sup>

#### **III. EVOLUTION**

PIL, drawn in many ways from radical changes in American public law adjudication, arrived in India several years after these changes in the United States.<sup>16</sup> Many scholars trace the beginnings of PIL to the landmark desegregation decisions of the 1950s when the US Supreme Court required schools in southern American States to end racial segregation.<sup>17</sup> By the 1980s, just as PIL jurisprudence was gaining momentum in India, the allure of public law litigation began to fade in the United States.<sup>18</sup> Quite apart from the personalities of the judges of the Supreme Court who actively fostered PIL, four distinct influences contributed to its growth, $\frac{19}{12}$  first, the 1970s trend that broadened the reach of administrative law to keep pace with the expanding role of government in a welfare state. The great leap forward in judicial oversight occurred when the Supreme Court through a process of judicial interpretation introduced the notion of 'due process of law' in its 1978 decision in *Maneka Gandhi*. 20 The framers of the Indian Constitution chose not to employ the expression 'due process of law' used in the US Constitution, and this omission was initially viewed as limiting judicial review of executive action.<sup>21</sup> Prior to 1978, Article 21 of the Constitution was interpreted narrowly to mean that as long as there was some statute enacted by the legislature impinging upon a person's life or personal liberty, the action could not be challenged as violating fundamental rights. *Maneka Gandhi* reversed this approach by reading Articles 14, 19, and 21 together, and the judgment effectively empowered the judiciary in India 'to supervise and invalidate any union or State action, whether legislative or executive or of any public authority perceived by the court to be "arbitrary" or "unreasonable"  $\frac{22}{2}$ The right to equality guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution was made even more muscular in a triad of decisions rendered in quick succession: *Ramana Dayaram Shetty v International Airport Authority of India*, <sup>23</sup> *Kasturi Lal Lakshmir Reddy v State of Jammu and Kashmir*, <sup>24</sup> and *Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib Sehravardi*. <sup>25</sup> The upshot of these judgments was that all government action was required to be based on some rational and relevant principle that was non-discriminatory, failing which the action would be treated as 'arbitrary' and violating Article 14. It is this administrative law doctrine that serves as the bedrock of PILin India.

The second influence, closely intertwined with the expansion of PIL, was a new imagination that informed Supreme Court judgments on the content of Article 21. The expression 'life' was interpreted broadly and positively to include every aspect of life that enabled a person to live with dignity.<sup>26</sup> The Supreme Court also recognised several unarticulated liberties that were implied by Article 21.<sup>27</sup> For this it turned to the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in **Part IV** of the Constitution, which

indicate goals to guide government.<sup>28</sup> Although unenforceable as per Article 37, the Directive Principles (DPSPs) were increasingly cited by judges as complementary to fundamental rights, and a justification for lending content and depth to the fundamental right to life. $\frac{29}{29}$ 

The third factor was the disposition of the Supreme Court to increase access to justice. Legal aid as an instrument of enabling the poor and disadvantaged to enforce their constitutional and statutory rights was the subject of three government reports.  $\frac{30}{2}$  These reports were the extrajudicial work of judges who steered early PILs in the Supreme Court, and who were sensitive to the peculiar problems of India's multitudinous poor. $31$  The reports recognised (to varying degrees) the necessity of courts altering their procedures so that those who were socio-economically handicapped were not denied their rights. Legal aid camps, voluntary mediation through Lok Adalats, and PILs were all part of a raft of initiatives by the Supreme Court to enable the poor to secure redress for their grievances.<sup>32</sup> As with other jurisdictions that adopted group litigations in the public law sphere, <sup>33</sup> access to justice served as an important impetus to PIL in India. $\frac{34}{3}$ 

The judicial renaissance of the late 1970s and 1980s followed upon a dark period when the Supreme Court justices abdicated their primary function as custodians of the Constitution. The anxiety of the Supreme Court to reclaim institutional legitimacy in the aftermath of the internal Emergency may be considered a fourth factor that propelled forward PIL jurisprudence. On 25 June 1975, an Emergency was declared on the ground of 'internal disturbance' threatening the security of India. $\frac{35}{10}$  A widespread denial of civil and political rights followed, including the arrest and detention of persons opposed to Indira Gandhi's government.<sup>36</sup> Overturning the decisions of several High Courts that had upheld the citizen's liberty during the Emergency, the Supreme Court capitulated to the executive's bidding and held that during the Emergency a person could be divested of his liberty even where he had not committed any breach of the law.<sup>37</sup> PIL enabled the Supreme Court to champion the protection of human rights and thereby rebuild its tarnished reputation.<sup>38</sup>

Looking back at three decades of PIL jurisprudence, the Supreme Court in 2010 classified the evolution of this field into three overlapping phases.<sup>39</sup> In its view, the earliest phase was when the Supreme Court issued directions to protect the right to life for the benefit of marginalised groups and sections of society who could not access courts because of their poverty, illiteracy, and ignorance. The second phase encompassed protection of environment, forests, natural resources, and cultural heritage such as historical monuments. This class of PILs may be termed as involving 'a collective right to a collective good'. $\frac{40}{10}$  The third phase comprised efforts by the Court to maintain probity, transparency, and integrity in governance. $\frac{41}{1}$  The trend line of PIL evolution indicates a drift away from the poverty and human rights focus of the early years to governance-related matters involving the democratic process.<sup>42</sup>

The pivot in the development of PIL jurisprudence in India has been Article 32 of the Constitution. Article 32 guarantees the remedy to petition the highest court for enforcement of any fundamental right assured in the Constitution. Consequently, in addition to its primary role as the final appellate court, Article 32 provides a direct link between the Supreme Court and citizens. This powerful, rolledtogether original and final remedy was wielded by the Supreme Court in the post-Emergency phase to target gross human rights violations. Not having to await an initial adjudication at the High Court tier, the Supreme Court was able to script rapid developments in PIL jurisprudence in cases it directly received.

#### **IV. STANDING**

To efficiently deploy judicial resources and decide genuine disputes of a legal character, courts regulate access by recognising only those persons with locus standi or legal standing.  $\frac{43}{12}$  But for this discipline, courts would get inundated by complaints from parties who have no legal stake in the resolution of the dispute. A competing vision, crucial for enhancing access to justice in respect of public grievances or with regard to the poor and disadvantaged, is the need for a liberal approach towards standing requirements. This latter vision was commended by the Supreme Court, anticipating the PILera:

Test litigations, representative actions, *pro bono publico* and like broadened forms of legal proceedings are in keeping with the current accent on justice to the common man and a necessary disincentive to those who wish to bypass the real issues on the merits by suspect reliance on peripheral, procedural shortcomings … Public interest is promoted by a spacious construction of locus standi in our socio-economic circumstances ...  $\frac{44}{3}$ 

Consistent with this approach and the recommendations in the legal aid reports authored by two of its judges, <sup>45</sup> the Supreme Court relaxed the traditional rules governing locus standi. Since a court will not hear a party unless he or she has sufficient stake in the controversy, judicial perception of who has sufficient interest (ie, 'the person aggrieved') is critical. In what is possibly the most significant factor that spurred the growth of PIL, the Supreme Court lowered the standing barriers by enlarging the concept of 'person aggrieved'.<sup>46</sup>

Traditionally, only a person whose own right was in jeopardy was entitled to seek a remedy. When extended to public actions, this meant that a person asserting a public right or interest had to show special circumstances, for example, that he or she had suffered some special injury over and above what members of the public had generally suffered. $\frac{47}{1}$  Thus, diffuse public injuries, such as air pollution affecting a large community or corruption in public administration, were difficult to redress through courts. Even under the orthodox standing doctrine, a narrow exception was available to citizens bringing before the court public grievances against local authorities. A rate payer, for example, could compel municipal authorities to perform their public duties, although the rate payer had suffered no individual harm.<sup>48</sup> The traditional view of standing also effectively prevented the grievances of India's poor from being heard by a court. Frequently, the poor and underprivileged are unwilling to assert their rights because of poverty, ignorance, or fear of social or economic reprisals from dominant sections of the community. These challenges could be reduced if, as in the case of a minor or a detained person, the law allowed a concerned citizen to sue on behalf of the underprivileged. In this section, we focus on three features of standing that are noticeable in PIL cases, developing upon an initial typology posited by Clark Cunningham in his classic study of the topic.<sup>49</sup>

# **1. Representative Standing**

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, in cases involving the underprivileged, the Supreme Court began to override the procedural obstacles and technicalities that had until then obstructed redress. Rather than reject a petition for lack of standing, the Court chose to expand standing so that it could decide the substantive issues affecting the rights of the underprivileged. This modification of the traditional rule of standing which permits the poor and oppressed to be represented by volunteers may be described as 'representative standing'.<sup>50</sup> Early representative standing cases in the Supreme Court helped secure the release of bonded labourers,  $\frac{51}{2}$  obtain pension for retired government employees,  $\frac{52}{2}$  and improve the living conditions of inmates at a protective home for women. 53 In *Hussainara Khatoon v Home Secretary*,<sup>54</sup> the Court implicitly recognised the standing of a public-spirited lawyer to move a petition on behalf of eighteen prisoners awaiting trials for very long periods in jails in the State of Bihar. The petition led to the discovery of over  $80,000$  prisoners,  $\frac{55}{2}$  some of whom had been languishing in prisons for periods longer than they would have served, if convicted.<sup>56</sup> Likewise, in *PUDR*,<sup>57</sup> the Court allowed a group of social activists to petition on behalf of exploited government construction workers, who were being paid less than the statutory minimum wage. The Court observed:

Here the workmen whose rights are said to have been violated and to whom a life of basic human dignity has been denied are poor, ignorant, illiterate humans who, by reason of their poverty and social and economic disability, are unable to approach the courts for judicial redress and hence the petitioners have, under the liberalised rule of standing, locus standi to maintain the present writ petition espousing the cause of the workmen.<sup>58</sup>

Thus, where a section of people have been denied access to the administration of justice, the PIL jurisdiction is exercised generously.<sup>59</sup>

# **2. Citizen Standing**

The second modification of the classical standing doctrine may be termed 'citizen standing'.<sup>60</sup> Here a concerned citizen (or voluntary organisation) may sue, not as a representative of others but in his or her own right as a member of the citizenry to whom a public duty is owed. This liberalisation stemmed from the need to check the abuse of executive authority in a modern welfare state. Enormous regulatory and fiscal authority is vested in the administrative agencies of government. On occasion, these agencies misuse their power and funds. If a public authority acting illegally causes a specific legal injury to a person or a specific group of persons, a private action for redress would lie under the traditional doctrine of standing. At times, however, the injury arising may be diffuse, as where government policy threatens to undermine judicial independence, or where official inaction threatens to harm the environment. In such cases, the restrictive traditional doctrine precludes relief and renders the executive action immune from judicial scrutiny.

Under increasing pressure to curb instances of official lawlessness, the Supreme Court expanded standing to enable a citizen to challenge such government actions in public interest, even though the citizen had not suffered any individual harm. An early suggestion of this trend is present in *Fertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union v Union of India*, <sup>61</sup> where a trade union challenged the sale of old machinery and a plant belonging to a State-owned corporation on the ground that the sale was arbitrary and violated the workers' right to occupation. The Court rejected the petition, finding no merit in either claim. However, on the issue of the trade union's standing, the Court observed:

If public property is dissipated, it would require a strong argument to convince the court that representative segments of the public or at least a segment of the public which is directly interested and affected would have no right to complain of the infraction of public duties and obligations … We are not too sure if we would have refused relief to the workers if we had found that the sale was unjust, unfair or mala fide.<sup>62</sup>

A concurring opinion developed the theme further:

Public interest litigation is part of the process of participative justice and 'standing' in civil litigation of that pattern must have liberal reception at the judicial doorsteps … If a citizen is no more than a wayfarer or officious intervener without any interest or concern beyond what belongs to any one of the 660 million people of this country, the door of the court will not be ajar for him. But, if he belongs to an organization which has special interest in the subject-matter, if he has some concern deeper than that of a busybody, he cannot be told off at the gates, although whether the issue raised by him is justiciable may still remain to be considered.<sup>63</sup>

It was a small step from here for the Supreme Court to hold in the *Judges' Transfer* case,  $\frac{64}{ }$  that even where no specific legal injury had been suffered, any concerned citizen may sue to check the damage to the public interest and uphold the rule of law.  $65$  Citizen standing has enabled individuals to check the abuse of public office by high government functionaries;  $\frac{66}{6}$  to challenge government policies;  $\frac{67}{67}$  and to test the legality of a fiscal policy that favoured tax dodgers.<sup>68</sup>

# **3. Litigational Competence**

In 1981, a seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court delivered a definitive judgment on standing in the *Judges' Transfer* case. <sup>69</sup> Although every judge delivered a separate opinion, there was general agreement with Bhagwati J's view on the issue of locus standi. Bhagwati J upheld the standing of practising lawyers to challenge a government policy to transfer High Court judges, thereby undermining judicial independence. The transformation in the law of standing in the PIL jurisdiction has seen the notion of a 'person aggrieved' replaced by a more accommodative concept of 'litigational competence'. $\frac{70}{10}$  Today, recognising their constitutional obligation to protect fundamental rights and advance good governance, judges are primarily concerned about the issue raised in the PIL and will generally lower procedural barriers where the cause warrants judicial intervention.<sup>71</sup> Affirmatively, the threshold for litigational competence requires the petitioner to act in 'utmost good faith'.<sup>72</sup> There is a high expectation of civic responsibility from a PIL petitioner. Where a petitioner's *bona fides* are in doubt but the cause of action is genuine and in the general public interest, the Court may appoint an *amicus curae* to deal with the matter keeping the original petitioner out.<sup>73</sup> Negatively, the PIL jurisdiction cannot be invoked by a person pursuing a hidden agenda, $\frac{74}{1}$  acting as a 'surrogate for ... phantom lobbies',  $\frac{75}{2}$  seeking to pursue commercial gain,  $\frac{76}{2}$  using the court process merely for publicity, $\frac{77}{1}$  or similar oblique motivations.  $\frac{78}{10}$  To preserve the sanctity of the PIL jurisdiction, a court will impose heavy costs where the petitioner lacks *bona fides*. 79

### **V. PROCEDURAL INNOVATIONS**

A range of procedural innovations distinguish the PIL field from conventional litigation. Legal procedures that ensure fairness and uniformity at the trial of conventional, adversarial lawsuits may not be necessary in PIL cases. Strict rules of pleading do not apply in PIL.<sup>80</sup> Judges like to view PIL as a collaborative effort between the court, the citizen, and the public official, where procedural safeguards have a diminished utility and may be relaxed to enable relief: 'it has to be remembered
that every technicality in the procedural law is not available as a defence when a matter of grave public importance is for consideration before the court'.<sup>81</sup>

For instance, the Supreme Court and the High Court treat letters written to the court as writ petitions. These letters usually contain a bare outline of the grievance, the unsuccessful steps taken by the writer and a request to the court to set matters right. An early case in point is the *Dehradun Quarrying case*, <sup>82</sup> where the Supreme Court directed a letter to be treated as a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. The letter alleged that illegal limestone quarrying was devastating the fragile environment in the Himalayan foothills around Mussoorie. Satisfied that the matter merited inquiry, the Court first issued notices to the State and the collector of Dehradun to appear before the Court. Then, as a clearer picture of the facts, regulatory structures, and policies emerged, other affected parties—the Union Government, concerned government agencies and the mine owners were also impleaded. By August 1988, when the Supreme Court delivered its final order, five years after it had received the letter, the litigation had grown into a full-blown, complex environmental case. To streamline the procedure for letter petitions, the Supreme Court issued administrative guidelines indicating when letter petitions would be entertained and the procedure to be followed by its registry.<sup>83</sup> Moreover, acceptance of letter PILs indicates a departure from strict adherence to the rules of pleading. As a PIL progresses, the court generally does not insist upon formal amendments to the petition so long as the parties have notice of the issues being considered.<sup>84</sup> Akin to letter petitions, the *suo motu* PIL is occasionally resorted to where a High Court or Supreme Court bench learns about an emergent matter of public concern that troubles the judicial conscience. These cases are usually triggered by media reports.

As the flow of PILs grew, judges were pressed to evolve new procedures to facilitate resolution. Judicial innovation was required to: (1) secure detailed facts, since the petitioners' information was usually sketchy; (2) receive expert testimony in cases involving complex social or scientific issues; and (3) ensure the continuous supervision of prospective judicial orders. To construct the facts, the Court usually requires the concerned public officials to furnish comprehensive affidavits. Sometimes, as where a swift, impartial assessment of the facts is needed and the official machinery is unreliable, slow or biased, an affidavit may be unhelpful. Though site inspections to gauge the position in the field were initially tried by some judges,  $\frac{85}{5}$  this impracticable method yielded to court-appointed commissions to gather facts. <sup>86</sup> The commissioner's report is treated as prima facie evidence of the facts and data gathered.<sup>87</sup> Once the report is received by the Court, copies of it are supplied to the parties, who may choose to dispute the contents of the report in an affidavit. The Court then considers the report in light of the affidavits, and proceeds to decide the issues.<sup>88</sup>

In pollution cases in the 1990s, the Supreme Court relied on the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur to visit the affected locality and submit its field report. Confronted with severe pollution caused by the chemical industry, the Supreme Court directed NEERI to study the situation around Bichhri village in Rajasthan and submit a report suggesting remedial measures.<sup>89</sup> When tackling the pollution of the river Ganga by tannery clusters in Calcutta, the Supreme Court directed NEERI to report on the situation at the site and suggest solutions.<sup>90</sup> NEERI's role as an expert has extended to assessing the damage caused by polluters<sup>91</sup> or those who have caused other ecological harm.  $\frac{92}{2}$  The most notable expert body is the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) that assists the Supreme Court in forest cases and which has gained near-institutional status over a decade of functioning. <sup>93</sup> In December 1996, responding to a rapid decline in India's forests,

the Supreme Court asserted jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to the diversion of forests to nonforest use.  $\frac{94}{9}$  In discharging this role as custodian of national forests, the court relies heavily on the CEC for the purposes of assessing whether or not to permit forest clearance in individual cases and also to recommend measures to restore degraded areas.

Frequently, independent scientific expertise is essential to inform judicial decisionmaking. Judges in such cases usually appoint a committee of experts to probe scientific questions and advise the Court on a course of action. Since eminent scientists drawn from leading institutions compose these committees, the Court treats their opinion with great deference. For instance, faced with the allegation that imported Irish butter targeted for distribution was contaminated by the nuclear fallout from the Chernobyl disaster, the Supreme Court appointed an expert committee to determine whether the imported milk and dairy products were safe for human consumption. When the committee reported that the milk products were safe, the Court released the butter for distribution. 95 In the *Shriram Gas Leak* case, the Supreme Court solicited the help of several expert committees. The Nilay Choudhary committee was requested to advise the Court on whether Shriram's hazardous chemical plant, which was located in Delhi, should be allowed to recommence operations in view of the danger to the neighbourhood. The committee was also asked to suggest measures to reduce the environmental threat that the plan posed.<sup>96</sup> In the *Dehradun Quarrying* case,  $\frac{97}{2}$  the Supreme Court enlisted an expert committee to evaluate the environmental impact of limestone quarrying operations in the Mussoorie– Dehradun region. A 'monitoring committee' was formed to oversee the running of three limestone mines that had been allowed to continue operations, and to monitor reforestation measures in the region.<sup>98</sup> A 'rehabilitation committee' was also set up to rehabilitate the mine owners whose mines had been closed by the Court.<sup>99</sup>

In PIL jurisdiction, judges find that a deserving cause may at times suffer due to a lack of effective legal representation. To overcome this handicap, the Supreme Court has developed a practice of appointing *amicus curiae* to assist the Court *pro bono publico*. <sup>100</sup> Finally, in a conventional litigation, there are usually two stages: the interim hearing where the Court balances the equities and makes a temporary arrangement; and the final adjudication where relief is granted or denied. In contrast, the relief in most PIL cases is obtained through a series of interim directions. Since the judicial focus is on improving a deplorable state of affairs, judges are required to monitor compliance of their directions by periodically assessing progress in the case. This technique of monitoring compliance over several months or indeed, often years, is termed as a 'continuing mandamus', <sup>101</sup> another procedural innovation peculiar to PILs.

## **VI. JUSTICIABILITY**

The growth of PIL shattered traditional notions of justiciability. Matters involving State policy or technical intricacies were generally regarded beyond the judicial pale. This is because judges have no specialist knowledge, no support of a popular mandate, and no access to all competing viewpoints. With PIL creeping into areas of governance, notions of what could be decided by judges changed. The expanded reach of the right to life and the willingness of judges to declare policy based on technical and expert reports submitted to the court blurred the boundaries circumscribing adjudication. The main check on the ambit of justiciability is the judiciary itself because it is judges who decide on whether or not a particular issue is capable of judicial resolution. The sweep of PILs and the steady growth of its users testify to the erosion of this bulwark.

The earliest cases that we now recognise as PILs were brought by community-minded citizens seeking to hold government accountable for arbitrary conduct as in *Backbay <sup>102</sup>* or for human rights violations. As word spread about the low threshold requirements in instituting a PIL, the class of users expanded. The courts have entertained lawyers, journalists, law teachers, academics, environmentalists, social activists, students, eminent citizens, affected residents, farmers, and individuals with a special knowledge or concern on the subject of the petition. Seizing the opportunity opened up by the lowered standing barrier, numerous non-governmental organisations stepped forward to secure directions, frequently quasi-legislative in character, on a myriad subjects.<sup>103</sup> Often, established organisations extended their activism and reach by filing PILs, while on occasion groups coalesced to canvas a particular cause in court. PILs have been prosecuted by consumer rights groups, environmental groups, organisations focused on urban planning, human rights groups, housing societies, trade unions, animal rights organisations, judicial accountability forums, bar associations, child rights groups and forums established to redress the specific grievances of a community. Indeed, there are now organisations that are devoted to improving governance through PILs.<sup>104</sup> What are the causes espoused in PILs and entertained by the constitutional courts? Without building an exhaustive taxonomy, this short survey of a few Supreme Court decisions indicates the breadth of judicial discourse.<sup>105</sup>

A number of major PIL cases have involved human rights. For example, the Supreme Court has through its directions attempted to humanise prison administration. Prisoners languishing in Bihar's jails for years awaiting trial, and who had served time beyond the maximum sentence that could be imposed were released when the Court learnt about this horror.<sup>106</sup> The Court articulated the right to a speedy trial, <sup>107</sup> issued directions for the humane treatment of detainees, <sup>108</sup> including limits on solitary confinement of prisoners<sup>109</sup> and excessive handcuffing of prisoners.<sup>110</sup> Custodial violence and deaths have invoked a strong response from the Court to rein in police barbarity, <sup>111</sup> extending public law litigation to the award of compensation in cases of custodial death or torture.<sup>112</sup>

Children's rights have been another area of intervention. Finding that children were being illegally detained and harassed in prisons, the Supreme Court directed the establishment of juvenile courts with specially trained officers<sup>113</sup> who were sensitive to the special needs of children. Juveniles, when detained, could not be kept in the regular jails, but were sent to children's homes or special juvenile jails. The Court has also issued comprehensive directions governing inter-country adoptions.<sup>114</sup> The Supreme Court has intervened to prevent child labour employed in a match factory,  $\frac{115}{10}$  the carpet industry,  $\frac{116}{10}$  and circuses.  $\frac{117}{10}$  Relying on the fundamental right to education, the Supreme Court issued directions to ensure that school buildings comply with the national building code and are safe and secure for students.<sup>118</sup>

In several cases, the Supreme Court has paid special attention to the rights of women. Responding to a complaint about custodial violence against women prisoners, the Supreme Court framed guidelines for the proper treatment of women who are arrested.<sup>119</sup> Perhaps the most significant Supreme Court decision in a PIL relating to women in the workplace is when it laid down comprehensive guidelines with respect to the prevention of sexual harassment and establishing a machinery to redress complaints.<sup>120</sup> To redress nutritional deficiencies in children and pregnant women, the Supreme Court revised nutritional and feeding norms.<sup>121</sup>

Apart from civil-political rights, PIL has been a major instrument through which socio-economic rights adjudication has developed in India. Here, environmental protection has received special attention from the Supreme Court, possibly more than any other sphere of PIL activity. $\frac{122}{12}$  At a substantive level, the Court has enunciated numerous principles that form the bedrock of environmental jurisprudence in India. These principles include the fundamental right of every person to a healthful environment,  $\frac{123}{12}$  the principle of sustainable development,  $\frac{124}{124}$  the precautionary principle,  $\frac{125}{125}$  the polluter pays principle,  $\frac{126}{126}$  the public trust doctrine,  $\frac{127}{127}$  and the principle of intergenerational equity.<sup>128</sup> The tort liability regime was transformed in relation to accidents caused by hazardous industry with the articulation of the absolute liability principle.<sup>129</sup> The Supreme Court has required strict compliance with environmental laws,  $\frac{130}{130}$  set down policy when faced with an unresponsive administration,  $\frac{131}{2}$  and nudged the government to frame legislation.  $\frac{132}{2}$  The most farreaching exercise by the Supreme Court is with respect to the national forests resources, where the Court has acted as a custodian since 1996, permitting diversion of forests only where it is satisfied that the need is imperative.<sup>133</sup> The Supreme Court, through environmental PILs, has elevated the importance of ecological issues in developmental decision making, put a stop to some of the most egregious cases of pollution and illegal mining,  $\frac{134}{2}$  and worked to introduce a culture of compliance by insisting upon strict enforcement of environmental laws.

As noted previously, a major feature of PIL has been the transformation of the Supreme Court into an institution that mediates and adjudicates matters of governance. The Supreme Court has through its directions attempted to improve governance by increasing accountability and transparency. The voter's right to know the antecedents of candidates contesting elections was secured by the Court.<sup>135</sup> Abuse of discretion in allotting petrol pumps $\frac{136}{2}$  and government accommodation $\frac{137}{2}$  has been struck down. The Court has worked to unshackle the Central Bureau of Investigation from executive interference by monitoring criminal investigations against politically powerful persons.<sup>138</sup> Strengthening the appointment process regarding the Central Vigilance Commissioner, the Supreme Court has laid down parameters for ensuring that persons of high integrity are selected.<sup>139</sup> To restore public confidence in the criminal justice system, the Supreme Court has appointed special investigation teams  $\frac{140}{1}$  and directed retrial where there was an apparent failure of justice.  $\frac{141}{1}$  In an effort to deter backroom deals in the allocation of natural resources, the Court invalidated allocations and returned the resource to the State.<sup>142</sup>

These judicial forays challenge traditional notions of justiciability to the point where practitioners can scarcely predict whether a particular PIL will be entertained or not. There is no perceptible threshold to cross, except satisfying a judge that some aspect of governance can benefit from a judicial heave. The continuous search for judicially manageable standards lends creative uncertainty to a journey that commenced with *Backbay* in 1975.

## **VII. CONCLUSION**

For close to four decades, Indian courts have set apart judicial resources to foster PIL to a point where this jurisdiction defines public perception of the higher judiciary. In a milieu of rapid social transformation, a young aspiring population, and a vibrant civil society, courts directly speak to

citizens through judgments on issues of moment. Their decisions generally add to the prestige of the judiciary, often at the expense of other wings of government. As Indians work towards realising their constitutional goals and enforcing constitutional guarantees, they have secured to themselves a new manner of exerting pressure on the State to improve governance. Supplementing the electoral process, street agitations, and lobbying, constitutional courts are now a further means for connecting sections of the citizenry and government. The voice of the informed citizen, generally lost in the political din or unheard by the bureaucracy, is amplified by judicial notice. Although the PILdocket remains small, these cases are generally prioritised, having regard to the significant public interest element involved.<sup>143</sup> Electronic and print media increase the Court's visibility by widely reporting judicial observations in PILs, a heady experience for members of a cloistered calling. Indeed, PILs, in conjunction with the media, have provided a platform to the Supreme Court and the High Courts to enhance their own prestige by catalysing societal change in the face of moribund governance. While the courts recognise that major social engineering—or indeed even improvements—are scarcely possible through judicial intervention alone,  $\frac{144}{10}$  the justification for PIL remains the pursuit of constitutional goals by constitutional means. Guiding this new channel of citizen pressure, courts are now institutions of governance.

Inevitably, given the significance and nature of PIL, the revolution has led to numerous criticisms. Some suggest that the judiciary has lost its way, forsaking its initial constituency of the deprived and downtrodden to now address middle-class and elite concerns. Judicial intervention has hobbled agencies, which prefer to await court directions rather than perform their administrative functions. By wresting control over forests, monitoring pollution levels, and overseeing relief after a natural disaster, the court acts as a super-agency. Direct access to the constitutional courts through PIL tilts policymaking in favour of the minority who access these courts. Indeed, where policies are cast, multiple dimensions could well escape the attention of judges. The Court's efforts to cleanse government by overturning natural resource allocations result in massive economic disruptions. Business rivals and racketeers abuse the PIL processes to stall projects,  $\frac{145}{12}$  and on occasion, PILs have culminated in disastrous judgments re-criminalising homosexuals,  $\frac{146}{140}$  depriving millions of Mumbai's citizens access to green and recreational spaces,  $\frac{147}{147}$  and foisting on a nation a river interlinking project that could severely undermine the subcontinent's ecological integrity.<sup>148</sup> More modestly, the Court's directions are at times unenforceable.<sup>149</sup> The judicial incursion into the legislative and administrative sphere is potentially disruptive of the delicate institutional balance and constitutional framework of separation of powers.<sup>150</sup> Apart from the serious encroachment of turf, PIL judgments, with their ad hoc solutions, undermine certainty, predictability, and restraint—three cardinal values that nourish judicial legitimacy.

Important as these concerns are, the contributions of PIL in the fields of human rights and the environment—to pick two areas of activity—lend some justification to the judiciary's activism. Bonded labourers and illegally incarcerated prisoners, in their thousands, have been liberated. The fundamental principles of environmental law were all laid out in PILs, with the legislature catching up through subsequent legislation.<sup>151</sup> It is the Supreme Court that raised public awareness about the importance of environmental protection, long before any sustained executive initiative. Parliament too has recognised the value of PILs by empowering the National Human Rights Commission, as well as the National Legal Services Authority, to petition the Supreme Court or the High Court in the discharge of their functions. 152

The fears of limitless judicial review and an imperial judiciary are tempered by the changing

contours of PIL jurisprudence. New sector-specific statutes effectively shrink jurisdiction and the varied approaches to PIL.<sup>153</sup> Nevertheless, in a nation that persistently scores low on the human development index, it will be some time before the governance deficit shrinks to justify judicial retreat. Until then, PIL remains the judiciary's most visible tool for marketing constitutionalism.
