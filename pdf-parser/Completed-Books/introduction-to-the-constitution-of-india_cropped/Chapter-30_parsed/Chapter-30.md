# THE SERVICES AND PUBLIC **SERVICE COMMISSIONS**

ONE of the matters which do not usually find place in a constitutional document but have been included in our Constitution is the Public Services.

The wisdom of the makers of our Constitution in giving a constitutional

basis to such matters as are left to ordinary legislation and administrative regulations under other Constitutions may be appreciated if we properly assess the of importance of public servants in a modern democratic government.

A notable feature of the Parliamentary system of government is that while the policy of the administration is determined and laid down by ministers responsible to the Legislature, the policy is carried out and the administration of the country is actually run by a large body of officials who have no concern with politics. In the language of Political Science, the officials form the 'permanent' Executives as distinguished from the Ministers who constitute the 'political' Executive. While the political Executive is chosen from the party in majority in the Legislature and loses office as soon as that party loses its majority, the permanent Executive is appointed by a different procedure and does not necessarily belong to the party in power. It maintains the continuity of the administration and of the neutrality in politics that characterises the civil servants who constitute the permanent Executive and accounts for their efficiency. While the Ministers, generally, cannot claim any expert knowledge about the technique of administration and the details of the administrative departments, the civil servants, as a body, are supposed to be experts in the detailed working of government. One inherent vice in this system of carrying on the administration with the help of these 'permanent' civil servants is that they tend to be more and more tied to redtape and routine and lack that responsiveness to fresh ideas which the political Executive is sure to maintain owing to their responsibility to the Legislature. But with all this inherent vice, the civil servants are indispensable to the Parliamentary form of Government.

As the Joint Select Committee on Indian Constitutional Reforms<sup>1</sup> observed-

"The system of responsible Gcvernment, to be successful in practical working, requires the existence of a competent and independent Civil Service staffed by persons capable of giving to successive Ministers advice based on long administrative experience, secure in their positions, during good behaviour, but

required to carry out the policy upon which the Government and Legislature eventually decide.

The reason is that in the modern age, government is not only an art but also a science and, to that extent a business for experts. It has, therefore, naturally fallen into the hands of a very large army of people who have taken up the business of government, being in service of the Government, itself,-as their professional career. Since they cannot be dispensed with, the problem of a modern democracy is how to prevent them from converting the democratic system into a 'bureaucracy' or officialdom. The remedy lies not in the assumption of the work of government by the Legislature, for a direct democracy as prevailed in the ancient State is an impossibility under modern conditions. Nor does remedy lie in the assumption of the actual work of administration, as distinguished from the laying down of policies, by the Ministers or the political heads of the Departments, for, as has been already stated, the task is not only technical but enormous, and the Ministers might lose sight of the broader and serious questions of national urgency if they were to enter into the details of the day-to-day administration.

The proper solution of the problem, therefore is—firstly, to select the right type of men who shall be not only efficient but Matters which call also honest and who can be trusted with confidence for regulation.

that they would not abuse their position and would be strictly impartial, having no personal or political bias of their own and would be ready to faithfully carry out the policy once it is formulated by the government for the time being in power; secondly, to keep them under proper discipline so that they maintain the proper relationship with their employer, viz., the State; and thirdly, to ensure that for breaches of the rules of discipline, they can be brought under proper departmental action and, for breach of law, made answerable before the Courts of law. Once the interests of the State are thus secured, it is equally essential that the security of tenure of public servants who do not contravene the foregoing principles should be ensured. For, the best available talents would never be attracted unless there is a reasonable security against arbitrary action by superior officials who exercise the governmental power as to removal and discipline.

All the aforesaid objects can be achieved only if there are definite rules and proper safeguards in respect of what is broadly known as the 'conditions' of service' of public servants and our Constitution seeks to lay down some basic principles in this behalf.

It is not that our Constitution seeks to make detailed provisions relating

Power to prescribe conditions of Service.

to every matter concerning the Public Service. The makers of the Constitution realised that that was not practicable and therefore left the recruitment and conditions of service of the public servants of the

Union and of the State to be regulated by Acts of the appropriate Legislatures. Pending such legislation, however, these matters were to be regulated by Rules made by the President or by the Governor in connection with the services under the Union and the States respectively  $[Art. 309]$ . Once the legislature intervenes to enact a law, the power of the executive (the President/the Governor) is totally displaced and the Act of the legislature would have precedence over any rule made by the executive

#### **CHAP. 301** THE SERVICES AND PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONS

under Art. 309<sup>2</sup> but no rule can be framed which affects or impairs the vested rights.<sup>3</sup> However, these rules have equal force of law.<sup>4</sup> Though already some Acts have been passed, for instance, the All-India Services Act, 1951, the larger part of the field is still covered by Rules made by the Government, not only under the Constitution, but also those existing from before (that is, made under the Government of India Acts), which are to continue to be in force until superseded by the appropriate authority. It is to be noted, however, that neither a Rule nor any Act of the Legislature made in this behalf can have any validity if its provisions are contrary to those of the Constitution. As a matter of fact, our courts have already annulled a number of Service Rules on the ground of contravention of some of the constitutional provisions. For instance, if any rule or order enables the Government to dismiss a Government servant without giving him an opportunity to be heard, such rule would be struck down as unconstitutional owing to contravention of the requirement in Art. 311(2).<sup>5</sup>

The two matters which are substantively dealt with by our Constitution are-

(a) Tenure of office of the public servants and disciplinary action against them;

(b) The constitution and functions of the Public Service Commissions, which are independent bodies to advise the Government on some of the vital matters relating to Services.

We have inherited from the British system the maxim that all service is at the pleasure of the Crown, and our Constitution, **Tenure of office.** therefore, primarily declares that anybody who holds a post (civil or military) under the Union or a State holds his office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor, as the Service at case may be [Art. 310(1)]. The power to compulsory Pleasure. retire a government servant is one of the facets of the doctrine of pleasure incorporated in this Article.<sup>6</sup>

This means that any Government employee may be dismissed at any time and on *any* ground, without giving rise to any cause of action for wrongful dismissal, except where the dismissal is in contravention of the constitutional safeguards to be mentioned just now.

This right of the Government to dismiss a Government servant at its pleasure cannot be fettered by any contract and any contract made to this effect would be void, for contravention of Art. 310(1) **Cannot** be fettered of the Constitution which embodies the principle of by Contract.

service at pleasure. This rule is, however, subject to one exception specified in Art. 310(2) namely, that where Government is obliged to secure the services of technical personnel or specialists, not belonging to the regular Services, by entering into a special contract, without which such persons would not be available for employment under the Government. In such cases, compensation would be payable for premature termination of the service if the contract provides for such payment. But even in such cases, no compensation would be payable under the clause if the service is terminated within the contractual period, on the ground of his misconduct. It will be payable only-

### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 30

(a) if the post is abolished before the expiration of the contractual period; or,

(b) if the person is required to vacate his post before the expiry of the contractual period, for reasons unconnected with misconduct.

upon Limitations  $_{\mathrm{of}}$ exercise the Pleasure.

While, however, the pleasure of the Crown in England is absolutely unfettered, the Constitution of India subjects the above pleasure to certain exceptions and limitations:

A. In the case of certain high officials, the Constitution lays down specific procedures as to how their service may be terminated. Thus, as has

been noted in their proper places earlier, the Supreme Court Judges, the Auditor-General, the High Court Judges and the Chief Election Commissioner shall not be removed from their offices except in the manner laid down in Arts. 124, 148, 218, 324, respectively. These offices thus

constitute exceptions to the general rule of tenure 'during pleasure' of Government servants.

 $for$ **Safeguards** civil servants.

B. Though all other Government servants hold office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor (as the case may be), two procedural safeguards are provided for the security of tenure of 'civil' servants as distinguished

from military personnel, namely, that-

(a) A civil servant shall not be dismissed or removed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed. In other words, if he is to be removed from service, he is entitled to the consideration of his appointing authority or any other officer of corresponding rank before he is so removed. The object of this provision  $[Art. 311(1)]$  is to save a public servant from the caprices of officers of inferior rank.

(b) The other security which is guaranteed by the Constitution is that no dismissal, removal or reduction in rank shall be ordered against a civil servant unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of the charges brought against him.

A. Prior to 1976, this opportunity had to be given at two stages-(a) at the stage of inquiry into the charges; and (b) to make representation against the penalty (such as dismissal, removal, reduction in rank, censure) proposed to be imposed, after the inquiry had been concluded, holding the employee guilty of the charges.

B. But the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976, has omitted the right of the employee to make a representation against the penalty proposed, retaining, however, the safeguard that the penalty can be proposed only on the basis of the evidence adduced at the inquiry stage. The result is that the judicial decisions<sup>7</sup> prior to 1976, which required that the 'opportunity' under Art. 311(2) must be offered at two stages, have been superseded by the 42nd Amendment.

# CHAP. 30 THE SERVICES AND PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONS

Hence, after this amendment of 1976, the expression 'reasonable opportunity' must be interpreted to imply that the Government or other authority proceeding against a civil servant must give him-

(i) an opportunity to deny his guilt and establish his innocence, which he can only do if he is told what the charges levelled against him are and the allegations on which such charges are based;

ii) an opportunity to defend himself by cross-examining the witnesses produced against him and by examining himself or any other witnesses in support of his defence.

Hence, the authority must (i) frame specific charges with full particularity, (ii) intimate those charges to the Government servant concerned, (iii) give him an opportunity to answer those charges; (iv) after considering his answers, take its decision; and (v) the rules of natural justice should be observed in coming to the finding against the accused.

But no 'inquiry' need be held where the employee is given sufficient opportunity to explain his conduct but he does not wilfully avail himself of that opportunity<sup>8</sup> as was done in the case of dismissal of an absconder who failed to respond to show cause why his services be not terminated by way of dismissal as his further retention in service was not desirable.<sup>9</sup> This would not, however, apply where he fails to attend the inquiry owing to default of the Government in allowing him subsistence allowance.<sup>10</sup>

(iii) when the inquiry officer is not the disciplinary authority the delinquent employee has a right to receive a copy of the inquiry officers report before the disciplinary authority arrives at its conclusions. It is a part of the right to defence.

The inquiry must be held and the opportunity to be heard must be given if two conditions are satisfied:

In which cases the opportunity must be given.

(i) The employee is a member of a civil service of the Union or an all-India service or a civil service of a State or holds a civil post under the Union or a State.

(ii) Such employee is sought to be dismissed, removed or 'reduced in rank'.

While a person "dismissed" is ineligible for re-employment under the Government, no such disqualification attaches to a person 'removed'.<sup>12</sup> But two elements are common to 'dismissal' and 'removal':

(a) Both the *penalties* are awarded on the ground that the conduct of the Government servant is blameworthy or deficient in some respect.

(b) Both entail penal consequences, such as the forfeiture of the right to salary, allowances or pension already acquired, for past services.

What constitutes<br>Dismissal, Removal and Reduction in Rank.

Where no such penal consequence is involved, it would not constitute 'dismissal' or 'removal', e.g., where a Government servant is 'compulsorily retired', $5$ ,  $13$  without any further penal consequence attached to such order.<sup>14</sup>

#### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 30]

As would appear from the decisions of the Supreme Court,<sup>15</sup> the term actually used in the order terminating the officer's services is not conclusive. Words such as 'discharged' or 'retrenched' may constitute 'dismissal' or 'removal', if the order entails *penal consequences*, as referred to above. Termination of the services of a temporary employee during the pendency of his criminal trial, for the same assault, was held to be punitive amounting to dismissal.<sup>16</sup>

It is also clear that in order to attract Art. 311(2), the termination of services must be *against the will* of the civil servant. Hence, the following orders of termination of service have been held not to constitute 'dismissal' or 'removal':

(a) Termination in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment.<sup>17</sup>

(b) Termination in terms of the conditions of service as embodied in  $17-18$  the relevant Department Rules applicable to the Government servant, provided such conditions are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution.

(c) Fixing an age for superannuation or compulsory retirement<br> $\rm ^{19}$  and enforcement thereof.  $\rm ^{19}$ 

Reduction in rank means the degradation in rank or status of the officer, directed by way of penalty. It thus involves two elements-(a) reduction in the physical sense, meaning degradation; (b) such degradation or demotion must be by way of penalty.

(a) Reduction in rank in the *physical sense* takes place where the Government servant is reduced to a lower post or to a lower pay-scale. Even reduction to a lower stage in the pay-scale (ordered by way of penalty) would involve a reduction in rank, for the officer loses his rank or seniority in the gradation list of his substantive rank.

(b) As regards the *penal nature* of the reduction, the Supreme Court has applied the test of 'right to the rank' in question, in the same manner as the 'right to the post' test has been applied in the case of dismissal or removal. Reduction in rank takes place only when a person is reduced from his substantive rank. Hence,

(i) Where a Government servant has a right to a particular rank, the very reduction from that rank will be deemed to be by way of penalty and Art. 311(2) will be attracted, without more. Thus,

An officer who holds a permanent post in a substantive capacity, cannot be transferred to a lower post, without complying with Art. 311(2).

(ii) On the other hand, where a Government servant has no title to a particular rank, under the contract of his employment or conditions of service,-there will ordinarily be no reduction in rank within the meaning of Art. 311  $(2)$ ,<sup>20</sup>  $e.g.$ , where a person, who had been promoted to a higher post on an officiating basis<sup>21</sup> or contrary to the statutory recruitment rules<sup>22</sup>, is reverted to his substantive post as it is neither punitive nor illegal. But even in this case, the order of reversion will amount to 'reduction in rank' so as to attract Art. 311(2), if the reversion entails penal consequences, such as

postponement of future chances of promotion or the order contains a stigma which indicates that it was penal in nature;<sup>20</sup> though, in the absence of such penal features, the motive of the authority would be irrelevant.<sup>23</sup> Reversion of the employees from their confirmed posts by imposing additional qualifications and functions to their confirmed post would offend Art. 311.24

It is to be noted that even where a person holding a civil post is Exceptions to the dismissed, removed or reduced in rank, no inquiry of need be held and no opportunity need be given in requirement three classes of cases, which themselves explain the giving opportunity. reasons for the exceptions-

(a) Where a person is dismissed or removed or reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge; but such a charge must relate to a misconduct of such magnitude as would have deserved the penalty of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank<sup>25</sup>

(b) Where an authority empowered to dismiss or remove a person or to reduce him in rank is satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded by that authority in writing, it is not reasonably practicable to hold such inquiry the Supreme Court upheld the concurrent view taken by the disciplinary authority and the appellate authority that holding inquiry into the case of a Head Constable who was working for terrorists and preparing to murder some senior police officers, was not practicable.<sup>26</sup>; or

(c) Where the President or Governor, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to hold such inquiry [2nd Proviso to Art. 311 (2)].<sup>27</sup> In cases where the mere disclosure of the charge might affect the security of the State, the President or the Governor might exempt the holding of an inquiry<sup>28</sup> but such satisfaction should not be *mala fide*.<sup>29</sup> However, the satisfaction need not be personal as such power is exercised in compliance with Art. 166<sup>30</sup> but the Govt. is required to disclose the nature of activities of the employee which formed the basis of such satisfaction so that the court/tribunal may be able to determine whether there was any reasonable nexus between such activities and the security of the State or not<sup>31</sup> without which the dismissal might be held to be *ultra vires*.<sup>32</sup>

A radical change has taken place in the constitutional law relating to Services by the 42nd Constitution Amendment Act, 1976, which inserted

Article 323A of the Constitution and the Administrative **Tribunals** Act, 1985.

into the Constitution Art. 323A, to take out the adjudication of disputes relating to the recruitment and conditions of service of the public services of the Union and of the States from the hands of the Civil Courts and the High Courts and to place it before an Administrative Tribunal for the Union or of a State (as

the case may be).

This provision of the Constitution was to come into effect only if it was implemented by a law made by Parliament. That law has been enacted by Parliament in 1985 and brought into force on October 2, 1985, by setting up a Central Administrative Tribunal (with branches in the specified cities).

### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 30

According to this Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985 (as amended in 1986), the Central Administrative Tribunal will adjudicate disputes and complaints with respect to the 'recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union', excepting-

(a) Members of the Defence Forces.

(b) Officers and servants of the Supreme Court or of any High Court.

(c) Members of the secretarial staff of Parliament, or of any Legislature of any State or Union Territory.

Excluding the above categories, any public servant of the Union who is aggrieved, in the matter of his appointment, removal or reduction in rank or the like, shall have to be contented with administrative justice by a Tribunal instead of by a Court of law. The only Court to which the aggrieved person might run, as a last resort, is the Supreme Court, under Arts. 32 and 136.

The decisions of the Administrative Tribunal can, therefore, be challenged only before the Supreme Court and the High Court shall not be competent to interfere under Art. 226 or 227. But subsequently, the position turned out to be otherwise as the Supreme Court declared the Articles 323-A, Cl. 2(d) and 323-B, Cl. 3(d) and also the "exclusion of jurisdiction" clauses in all the legislations enacted in pursuance of these Articles, unconstitutional to the extent they excluded the jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme Court under Arts. 226/227 and 32.33

There shall be a Public Service Commission for the Union; and a

Service Public **Commissions** for the Union and the States.

Public Service Commission for each State or a Joint Public Service Commission for a group of States if the Parliament provides for the establishment of such a Joint Public<br>Service Commission in pursuance of a resolution to<br>that effect being passed by the State Legislatures<br>concerned. The Union Public Service Commission

also may, with the approval of the President, agree to serve the needs of a State, if so requested by the Governor of that State [Art. 315].

The number<sup>34</sup> of members of the Commission and their conditions of service shall be determined (a) by the President in the case of the Union or a Joint Commission, and (b) by the Governor of the State in the case of a State Commission; provided that the conditions of service of a member of a Commission shall not be altered to his disadvantage after his appointment.

Appointment and Term of office of Members.

The *appointment* of the Chairman and members of the Commission shall be made— $(a)$  in the case of the Union or a Joint Commission, by the President; and (b) in the case of a State Commission, by the Governor of the State. Half of the members of a Commission shall be persons

who have held office under the Government of India or of a State for at least ten years  $[Art. 316]$ .

The term of service of a member of a Commission shall be six years from the date of his entering upon office, or until he attains the age of sixty five years in the case of the Union Commission or of sixty two years<sup>35</sup> in the
## CHAP. 30] THE SERVICES AND PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONS

case of a State or a Joint Commission. But a member's office may be terminated earlier, in any of the following ways:

(i) By resignation in writing addressed to—the President in the case of the Union or a Joint Commission, or the Governor in the case of a State Commission.

(ii) By removal by the President-(a) if the member is adjudged insolvent; or engages himself during his term in paid employment outside the duties of his office; or is in the opinion of the President infirm in mind or body; (b) on the ground of misbehaviour according to the report of the Supreme Court which shall hold an enquiry on this matter on a reference being made by the President.

Thus, even in the case of a State Commission, it is only the President who can make a reference to the Supreme Court and make an order of removal in pursuance of the report of the Supreme Court. The Governor has only the power to pass an interim order of suspension pending the final order of the President on receipt of the report of the Supreme Court  $[Art. 317(1) - (2)].$ 

If a member's term comes to an end while a reference under Art. 317(1) is pending in the Supreme Court the reference<sup>36</sup> does not become infructuous and the court must answer it.

A member shall be deemed to be guilty of misbehaviour-(i) if he is in any way concerned or interested in any contract made on behalf of the Government of India or of a State; or (ii) if he participates in any way in the profit of such contract or agreement or in any benefit therefrom otherwise than as a member and in common with other members of an incorporated company  $[Art. 317(4)].$ 

The Constitution seeks to maintain the independence of the Public Service Commission from the Executive in several ways-

(a) The Chairman or a member of a Independence of Commission can be removed from office only in the the Commission. manner and on the grounds specified in the Constitution (see above).

(b) The conditions of service of a member of the Public Service Commission shall not be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment [Proviso to Art. 318].

(c) The expenses of the Commission are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India or of the State (as the case may be) [Art. 322].

(d) Certain disabilities are imposed upon the Chairman and members of the Commission with respect to future employment under the Government [Art. 319]. Thus, on ceasing to hold office-

a) The Chairman of the Union Public Service Commission shall be ineligible for further employment either under the Government of India or under the Government of a State;

Prohibition as to the holding of offices by Members of Commission on ceasing to be such Members.

(b) the Chairman of a State Public Service Commission shall be eligible for appointment as the Chairman or any other member of the Union Public Service Commission or as the Chairman of any other

### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA $[CHAP. 30]$

State Public Service Commission, but not for any other employment either under the Government of India or under the Government of a State;

(c) a member other than the Chairman of the Union Public Service Commission shall be eligible for appointment as the Chairman of the Union Public Service Commission or as the Chairman of a State Public Service Commission, but not for any other employment either under the Government of India or under the Government of a State;

(d) a member other than the Chairman of a State Public Service Commission shall be eligible for appointment as the Chairman or any other member of the Union Public Service Commission or as the Chairman of that or any other State Public Service Commission, but not for any other employment either under the Government of India or under the Government of a State.

In short, the bar against employment under the Government is absolute in the case of the Chairman of the Union Public Service Commission; while in the case of the Chairman of a State Public Service Commission or of the other members of the Union or State Commissions, there is scope of employment in a higher post within the Public Service Commission but not outside.

The Public Service Commissions are advisory bodies.<sup>37</sup> It is open to the government to accept the recommendation or depart from it:38

The following are the duties of the Union and the State Public Service Commissions-

(a) To conduct examination for appointments to the services of the Union and the services of the State respectively.  $\alpha$ f **Functions** 

Service Public Commissions.

(b) To advise on any matter so referred to them and on any other matter which the President, or, as the case may be, the Governor of a State may refer to

the appropriate Commission  $[Art. 320]$ .

(c) To exercise such additional functions as may be provided for by an act of Parliament or of the Legislature of a State—as respects the services of the Union or the State and also as respects the services of any local authority or other body corporate constituted by law or of any public institution  $[Art. 321].$ 

(d) To present annually to the President or the Governor a report as to the work done by the Union or the State Commission, as the case may be  $[Art. 323]$ .

(e) It shall be the duty of the Union Public Service Commission, if requested by any two or more States so to do, to assist those States in framing and operating schemes of joint recruitment for any services for which candidates possessing special qualifications are required  $[Art. 320(2)].$ 

(f) The Public Service Commission for the Union, if requested so to do by the Governor of a State, may, with the approval of the President, agree to serve all or any of the needs of the State.

# CHAP. 30] THE SERVICES AND PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONS

The Union Public Service Commission or the State Public Service Commission, as the case may be, shall be consulted-

(a) on all matters relating to methods of recruitment to civil services and for civil posts;

(b) on the principles to be followed in making appointments to civil services and posts and in making promotions and transfers from one service to another and on the suitability of candidates for such appointments, promotions or transfers;

(c) on all disciplinary matters affecting a person serving under the Government of India or the Government of a State in a civil capacity, including memorials or petitions relating to such matters;

(d) on any claim by or in respect of a person who is serving or has served under the Government of India or the Government of a State or under the Crown in India or under the Government of an Indian State, in a civil capacity, that any costs incurred by him in defending legal proceedings instituted against him in respect of acts done or purporting to be done in the execution of his duty should be paid out of the Consolidated Fund of India, or, as the case may be, out of the Consolidated Fund of the State;

(e) on any claim for the award of a pension in respect of injuries sustained by a person while serving under the Government of India or the Government of a State or under the Crown in India or under the Government of an Indian State, in a civil capacity, and any question as to the amount of any such award  $[Art. 320(3)].$ 

## But-

(i) The President or the Governor, as the case may be, as respects the services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State, may specify the matters in which either generally, or in any particular class of cases, or in any particular circumstances, it shall not be necessary for a Public Service Commission to be consulted. But all such regulations must be laid before the appropriate Legislature and be subject to such modifications as may be made by the Legislature.

(ii) It has been held by the Supreme Court<sup>39</sup> that the obligation of the Government to consult the Public Service Commission in any of the matters specified above does not confer any right upon any individual who may be affected by any act of the Government done without consulting the appropriate Commission as required by the Constitution. The reason assigned by the Court is that the consultation prescribed by the Constitution is to afford proper assistance to the Government, in the matter of assessing the guilt of a delinquent officer, the merits of a claim for reimbursement of legal expenses and the like; and that the function of the Commission being purely advisory,<sup>37</sup> if the Government fails to consult the Commission with respect to any of the specified matters, the resulting act of the Government is not invalidated by reason of such omission and no individual who is affected by such act can seek redress in a Court of law against the Government for such irregularity or omission.<sup>39</sup>

# INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 30

As stated already, it shall be the duty of the Union Commission to present annually to the President a report as to the work done by the Commission and on receipt of such report the President shall cause a copy

## Report of Public Service Commissions.

thereof together with a memorandum explaining, as respect the cases, if any, where the advice of the Commission was not accepted, the reason for such non-acceptance, to be laid before each House of

Parliament [Art. 323(1)]. A State Public Service Commission has a similar duty to submit an annual report to the Governor and the latter has a duty to lay a copy of such report before the State Legislature with a memorandum explaining the cases, if any, where the advice of the Commission was not accepted by the Government [Art. 323(2)].

As stated earlier, the function of the Public Service Commission is only advisory and the Constitution has no provision to make it obligatory upon the Government to act upon the advice of the Commission in any case.<sup>37</sup>

How far Commission's advice binding on the Government.

The reason is that, under the Parliamentary system of government, it is the Cabinet which is responsible for the proper administration of the country and its responsibility is to Parliament. They cannot, therefore, abjure this ultimate responsibility by binding

themselves by the opinion of any other body of persons. On the other hand, in matters relating to the recruitment to the Services and the like, it would be profitable for the Ministers to take the advice of a body of experts. It is in this light that Sir Samuel Hoare<sup>40</sup> justified the parallel provisions as to the Public Service Commissions in the Government of India Act, 1935-

"Experience goes to show that they are likely to have more influence if they are advisory than if they have mandatory powers. The danger is that if you give them mandatory powers you then set up two governments."

But, though the Simon Commission<sup>41</sup> was conscious of the fact that left alone, the Ministers might use their position "to promote family or communal interests at the expense of the efficiency or just administration of the services", no safeguard was prescribed in the Government of India Act, 1935 against a flagrant disregard of the recommendations of the Commissions by the Government. In view of the possibility of such abuse, the Constitution has provided the safeguard (referred to above) of the Commission's Report being laid before Parliament (or State Legislature), through the President (or the Governor) as the case may be. The Government is under an obligation, while presenting such Report, to explain the reasons why in any particular case the recommendation of the Commission has been overridden by the Government. In view of this obligation to submit to Parliament an explanation for non-acceptance of the advice of the Commission, the number of such cases may be said to have been kept at a minimum.

Notwithstanding the above safeguard, there is criticism from certain quarters that patronage is still exercised by the Government by resorting to some devices-

(a) One of these is the system of making ad hoc appointments for a temporary period without consulting the Public Service Commission, and

#### THE SERVICES AND PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONS **CHAP. 301**

then approaching the Commission to approve of the appointment at a time when the person appointed has already been in service for some time and the recommendations of his superiors are available to him, in addition to the experience already gained by him in the work, which puts him at an advantage over the new candidates. The Supreme Court has been deprecating this practice of making ad hoc appointments. The Supreme Court did not allow the services of the employees appointed de hors the rules, although officiating for a long period of 14 years;<sup>42</sup> that of the *ad hoc* appointees by bypassing the process of recruitment through open competition<sup>43</sup> and a temporary appointee on monthly basis during the period of strike,<sup>44</sup> to be regularised.

(b) Sometimes the rules laying down the qualifications for the office to which such appointment has been made is changed retrospectively to fit in the appointee.

(c) Another complaint is that sometimes the Reports are presented before Parliament (or State Legislature as the case may be) long after the year under review. This, however, does not appear to be permissible under the Constitution. So far as the duty of the Commission to report to the President or the Governor is concerned, the Constitution says that it must be done 'annually'. Hence, his obligation cannot be postponed for more than a few months from the end of the period under Report. The duty of the President or the Governor is to present the Report to Parliament or the State Legislature "on receipt of such Report". Though no specific time-limit is imposed, it is clear that it must be done as soon as possible after the receipt of the annual Report and it cannot be construed that the obligation is discharged by presenting the Report two or three years after the receipt or by presenting the Reports for two or three years in a lump. The presentation before the Legislature must also be an annual affair, and, if the President or the Governor makes delay, it should be the concern of the appropriate Legislature to demand an explanation for such delayed presentation, apart from anything else. If the Legislature slumbers, the entire machinery of Parliamentary government will succumb, not to speak of any particular object of scrutiny by the Legislature.

Another matter relating to the Services which is dealt with by the Constitution is the creation of All-India Services. The All-India Services should be distinguished from Central Services. The **All-India Services.** 'Central Services' is an expression which refers to certain Services under the Union, maintained on an all-India basis, for service throughout the country-for instance, the Indian Foreign Service, the Indian Audit and Accounts Service, the Indian Customs and Excise Service and the like. The expression "All-India Service", on the other hand, is a technical one, used by the Constitution to indicate only the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service and such other Services<sup>45</sup> which may be included in this category in the manner provided by Art. 312 of the Constitution. That Article provides that if the Council of States declares by a resolution, supported by not less than two-third of the members present and voting, that it is necessary and expedient in the national interest to create an All-India Service, common to the Union and the States, Parliament may provide for its creation by making a law. The practical incident of an AllINTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 30

India Service thus is that the recruitment to it and the conditions of service under it can be regulated only by an Act of the Parliament. It must be noted that it is by virtue of this power that Parliament has made the All-India Services Act, 1951 and that the conditions of service, recruitment, conduct, discipline and appeal of the members of the All-India Services are now regulated by Rules made under this Act. Since these Rules provide that the officers of the All-India Services shall be appointed and controlled by the Union Government, these Services constitute an additional agency of control of the Union over the State, insofar as members of these Services are posted in key posts in the States.

Fundamental Rights of Civil<br>Servants.

I. Subject to the power of Parliament, under Art. 33, to modify the fundamental rights in their application to members of<br>the Armed Forces and the Police Forces, the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution are in favour of all 'citizens', which obviously include

public servants.<sup>46</sup>

II. It follows, therefore, that a civil employee of the Government is entitled to the protection of a fundamental right such as Arts. 14,<sup>47</sup> 15,<sup>48</sup> 16,<sup>49</sup> 19,<sup>46</sup> 20 in the same manner as a private citizen. Thus-

If two sets of rules relating to disciplinary proceedings were in operation at the time when the inquiry was directed against a Government servant, and the inquiry was directed under the set of Rules which was more drastic and prejudicial to the interests of such Government servant, the proceedings against him are liable to be struck off as infringing Art. 14. In other words, if against two public servants similarly circumstanced enquiries may be directed according to procedure substantially different,<sup>47</sup> at the discretion of the Executive authority, exercise whereof is not governed by any principles having any rational relation to the purpose to be achieved by the inquiry, the order selecting a prejudicial procedure, out of the two open for selection, is hit by Art. 14.4

III. Restrictions upon the rights of the public servants under Art. 19 can, therefore, be imposed only on the grounds specified in Cls. (2)-(6), and to the extent that the restriction is reasonable.<sup>46</sup>

But while a public servant possesses the fundamental rights as a citizen, the State also possesses, under the Proviso to Art. 309, the power to regulate their 'conditions of service'. Now, the interests of service under the State require efficiency, honesty, impartiality and discipline and like qualities on the part of the public servant. The State has thus the constitutional power to ensure that every public servant possesses these qualities and to prevent any person who lacks these qualities from being in the public service. It seems, therefore, that State regulation of the conditions of service of public servants so as to restrict their fundamental rights will be valid only to the extent that such restriction is reasonably necessary in the interests of efficiency, integrity impartiality, discipline, responsibility and the like which have a 'direct, proximate and rational' relation to the conditions of public service as well as the general grounds (e.g., public order, under Art. 19) upon which the fundamental rights of all citizens may be restricted.<sup>46</sup>

The Supreme Court has directed the Government of India to take steps for setting up an All-India Judicial Service [All India Judges' Assocn v. Union of India, AIR 1992 S.C. 165 (para 10A)]. No such Service appears to have been created by now.
