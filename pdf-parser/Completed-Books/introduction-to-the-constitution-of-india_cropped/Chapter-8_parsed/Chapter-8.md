# **CHAPTER 8 FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES**

WAT BEEN PRINCE SENT OF WAISHING AND

Individual Rights<br>and Fundamental Rights.

THE Constitution of England is unwritten. Hence, there is, in England, no code of Fundamental Rights as exists in the Constitution of the United States or in other written Constitutions of the world. This does not mean, however, that in England there is no recognition of those basic

rights of the individual without which democracy becomes meaningless. The

The position in individual rights in England may be said to be England. and freedom to take whatever action he likes, so long

as he does not violate any rule of the ordinary law of the land. Individual liberty is secured by judicial decisions determining the rights of individuals in particular cases brought before the Courts.

The Judiciary is the guardian of individual rights in England as elsewhere; but there is a fundamental difference. While in England, the Courts have the fullest power to protect the individual against executive tyranny, the Courts are powerless as against legislative aggression upon individual rights. In short, there are no fundamental rights binding upon the Legislature in England. The English Parliament being theoretically 'omnipotent', there is no law which it cannot change. As has been already said, the individual has rights, but they are founded on the ordinary law of the land which can be changed by Parliament like other laws. So, there is no right<br>which may be said to be 'fundamental' in the strict sense of the term.<br>Another vital consequence of the supremacy of Parliament is that the<br>English cannot declare any law as unconstitutional on the ground of contravention of any supposed fundamental or natural right.

The fundamental difference in approach to the question of individual rights between England and the United States is that Bill of Rights in while the English were anxious to protect individual<br>the U.S.A. rights from the abuses of executive power, the framers

of the American Constitution were apprehensive of tyranny not only from the Executive but also from the Legislature,—*i.e.*, a body of men who for the time being form the majority in the Legislature.

So, the American Bill of Rights (contained in the first Ten Amendments of the Constitution of the U.S.A.) is equally binding upon the Legislature as upon the Executive. The result has been the establishment in the United States of a 'judicial supremacy', as opposed to the 'Parliamentary supremacy' in England. The Courts in the United States are competent to declare an Act of Congress as unconstitutional on the ground of contravention of any provision of the Bill of Rights. Further, it is beyond the competence of the Legislature to modify or adjust any of the fundamental rights in view of any emergency or danger to the State. That power has been assumed by the Judiciary in the United States.

of **History** the demand for Fundamental Rights in India.

In India, the Simon Commission and the Joint Parliamentary Committee which were responsible for the Government of India Act, 1935, had rejected the idea of enacting declarations of fundamental rights on the ground that "abstract declarations are useless, unless there exist<br>the will and the means to make them effective". But

nationalist opinion, since the time of the Nehru Report,<sup>1</sup> was definitely in favour of a Bill of Rights, because the experience gathered from the British regime was that a subservient Legislature might serve as a handmaid to the Executive in committing inroads upon individual liberty.

Regardless of the British opinion, therefore, the makers of our Constitution adopted Fundamental Rights to safeguard individual liberty and also for ensuring (together with the Directive Principles) social, economic and political justice for every member of the community.<sup>2</sup> That they have succeeded in this venture is the testimony of an ardent observer of the Indian Constitution.<sup>3</sup>

"In India it appears that the Fundamental Rights have both created a new equality... and have helped to preserve individual liberty... The number of rights cases brought before High Courts and the Supreme Court attest to t Rights, and the frequent use of prerogative writs testifies to their popular<br>acceptance as well. The classic arguments against the inclusion of written rights in a Constitution have not been borne out in India. In fact, the reverse may have been the

So, the Constitution of India has embodied a number of Fundamental

Courts have the power to declare as void laws contra-<br>vening Fundavening mental Rights.

Rights in Part III of the Constitution, which are (subject to exceptions, to be mentioned hereafter) to act as limitations not only upon the powers of the Executive but also upon the powers of the Legislature. Though the model has been taken from the Constitution of the United States, the Indian Constitution does not go so

far, and rather effects a compromise between the doctrines of Parliamentary sovereignty and judicial supremacy. On the other hand, the Parliament of India cannot be said to be sovereign in the English sense of legal omnipotence,-for, the very fact that the Parliament is created and limited by a written Constitution enables our Parliament to legislate only subject to the limitations and prohibitions imposed by the Constitution, such as, the Fundamental Rights, the distribution of legislative powers, etc. In case any of these limitations are transgressed, the Supreme Court and the High Courts are competent to declare a law as unconstitutional and void. So far as the contravention of Fundamental Rights is concerned, this duty is specially

enjoined upon the Courts by the Constitution  $[Art. 13]$ , by way of abundant caution. Clause (2) of Art. 13 says-

"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void."

To this extent, our Constitution follows the American model rather than the English.

But the powers of the Judiciary vis-a-vis the Legislature are weaker in India than in the United States in two respects:

Firstly, while the declarations in the American Bill of Rights are

**Fundamental** under **Rights** Constitu-Indian tion distinguished from American **Bill of Rights.** 

absolute and the power of the State to impose restrictions upon the fundamental rights of the individual in the collective interests had to be evolved by the Judiciary,-in India, this power has been expressly conferred upon the Legislatures by the Constitution itself in the case of the major fundamental rights, of course, leaving a power of judicial review in the hands

of the Judiciary to determine the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the Legislature.

Secondly, by a somewhat hasty step, the Janata Government, headed by

44th Amendment,<br>1978. The right to property.

Morarji Desai, has taken out an important fundamental right, namely, the right of Property, by omitting Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31, by the 44th Amendment Act, 1978. Of course, the provision in Art. 31(1) has, by the

same amendment, been transposed to a new article,-Art. 300A, which is outside Part III of the Constitution and has been labelled as 'Chapter IV' of Part XII (which deals with 'Finance, Property, Contracts and Suits'),-but that is not a 'fundamental right'.

While under the Congress rule for 30 years, the ambit of the Fundamental Rights embodied in Part III of the original Constitution had been circumscribed by multiple amendments, bit by bit, the death blow to one of the Fundamental Rights came from the Janata Government.

The net result of the foregoing amendments inflicted upon the right to property are-

(i) The right not to be deprived of one's property save by authority of law is no longer a 'fundamental right'. Hence, if anybody's property is taken away by executive fiat without the authority of law or in contravention of a law, the aggrieved individual shall have no right to move the Supreme Court under Art. 32.

(ii) If a Legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, he cannot challenge the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by such law, invoking Art. 19(1)(f), because that provision has ceased to exist.<sup>4</sup>

(iii) Since Cl.(2) of Art. 31 has vanished, the individual's right to property is no longer a guarantee against the Legislature in respect of any compensation for loss of such property. Article 31(2) [in the original Constitution] embodied the principle that if the State makes a compulsory

acquisition or requisitioning of private property, it must (a) make a law; (b) such law must be for a public purpose; and (c) some compensation must be paid to the expropriated owner.

Of course, by the 25th Amendment of 1971, during the regime of Mrs. Gandhi, the requirement of 'compensation' was replaced by 'an amount', the adequacy of which could no longer be challenged before the Courts. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held, the aggrieved individual might complain if the 'amount' so offered was *illusory* or amounted to 'confiscation'.<sup>5</sup> But even such an innocuous possibility has been foreclosed by the 44th Amendment.

The short argument advanced in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 45th Amendment Bill for deleting the fundamental right to property is that it was only being converted into a *legal* right. What is meant is that while Arts.  $19(1)(f)$  and  $31(2)$  of the *original* Constitution operated as limitations on the Legislature itself, the 45th Amendment Bill inst Legislature as the guardian of the individual's right to property, without any fetter on its goodwill and wisdom. But if the Legislature could be presumed to be so infallible and innocent, this would be a good argument for omitting all the fundamental rights from Part III. As it has been pointed out earlier, the very justification of putting limitations on the Legislature by adopting a guarantee of Fundamental Rights is that history has proved that the group of human beings constituting, for the time being, the majority in a Legislative body, are not always infallible and that is why constitutional safeguards are necessary to permanently protect the individual from legislative tyranny.

Thirdly, by subsequent amendments, the arena of Fundamental Rights has been narrowed down by introducing certain exceptions to the operation of fundamental rights, namely, Articles 31A, 31B, 31C, 31D.<sup>6</sup>

(a) Of these, Arts. 31A, 31C are exceptions to the fundamental rights enumerated in Articles 14 and 19; this means that any **Exceptions** to law falling under the ambit of Art. 31A (e.g., a law for Fundamental

agrarian reform), or Art. 31C (a law for the implementation of any of the Directive Principles contained in Part IV of the Constitution), cannot be invalidated by any Court on the ground that it contravenes any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Art. 14 (equality before law); Art. 19 (freedom of expression, assembly, etc.).

(b) Art. 31B, however, offers almost complete exception to all the fundamental rights enumerated in Part III. If any enactment is included in the 9th Schedule, which is to be read along with Art. 31B, then such enactment shall be immune from constitutional invalidity on the ground of contravention of any of the fundamental rights. But shall be open to challenge on the ground of damage to the basic structure of the Constitution subsequent to 24-4-1973 (i.e. the date of decision in Kesavananda's case).7

Fourthly, by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, a countervailing factor has

been introduced, namely, the Fundamental Duties mentioned in Art. 51A. Though these Duties are not themselves enforceable in the Courts nor their

violation, as such, punishable, nevertheless, if a Court, before which a fundamental right is sought to be enforced, has to read all parts of the

Constitution, it may refuse to enforce a fundamental right at the instance of an individual who has patently violated any of the Duties specified in Art. 51A.8 If so, the emphasis of the original Constitution on fundamental rights has been minimised.

Fifthly, the category of 'fundamental rights' under our Constitution is

the

of exhaustively enumerated in Part III of the Constitution. The American Constitution (9th Amendment) expressly says that the enumeration of certain rights in<br>the Bill of Rights "shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." This rests on

the theory of inalienable natural rights which can by no means be lost to the individual in a free society; the guarantee of some of them in the written Constitution cannot, therefore, render obsolete any right which inhered in the individual even before the Constitution, e.g., the right to engage in political activity. But there is no such unenumerated right under our Constitution.

As was observed in the early case of A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras,<sup>9</sup> the Legislatures under our Constitution being sovereign except insofar as their sovereignty has been limited by the Constitution either expressly or by necessary implication, the Courts cannot impose any limitation upon that sovereignty either on the theory of the 'spirit of the Constitution' or of that of 'natural rights', i.e., rights other than those which are enumerated in Part III of the Constitution.<sup>10</sup> Any expansion of the Fundamental Rights under the Indian Constitution must, therefore, rest on judicial interpretation and the Supreme Court has gone ahead in this direction by enlarging the scope of Art. 21.<sup>11</sup>

It should not be supposed, however, that there is no other justiciable

right provided by our Constitution outside Part III. following Limitations upon the State are imposed by other provisions of the Constitution and these limitations give rise to corresponding rights to the individual to enforce them in a Court of law if the Executive or the

Legislature violates any of them. Thus, Art. 265 says that "no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law". This provision confers a right upon an individual not to be subjected to arbitrary taxation by the Executive, and if the Executive seeks to levy a tax without legislative sanction, the aggrieved individual may have his remedy from the Courts.<sup>12</sup> The new provision in Art. 300A belongs to this category.<sup>13</sup> Similarly, Art. 301 says that "subject to the provisions of this Part, trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free". If the Legislature or the Executive imposes any restriction upon the freedom of trade or intercourse which is not justified by the other provisions of Part XIII of the Constitution, the individual who is affected by such restriction may challenge the action by appropriate legal proceedings.<sup>14</sup>

What, then, is the distinction between the 'fundamental rights' included in Part III of the Constitution and those rights arising out of the limitations contained in the other Parts<sup>15</sup> which are equally justiciable? Though the rights of both these classes are equally justiciable, the constitutional remedy by way of an application direct to the Supreme Court under Art. 32, which

is itself included in Part III, as a 'fundamental right', is available only in the case of fundamental rights. If the right follows from some other provision of

the Constitution, say, Art. 265 or Art. 301, the<br>aggrieved person may have his relief by an ordinary suit or, by an application under Art. 226 to the High Court, but an application under Art. 32 shall not lie, unless the invasion of the non-fundamental right involves the violation of some fundamental right as

well.<sup>16</sup>

As the word 'fundamental' suggests, under some Constitutions, fundamental rights are immune from constitutional amendment; in other words, they are conferred a special sanctity as compared with other provisions of the Constitution. But this principle has been rejected by the Indian Constitution, as it stands interpreted by amendments of the Constitution themselves and judicial decisions.

Of course, no part of the Constitution of India can be changed by ordinary legislation unless so authorised by the Constitution itself (e.g., Art. 4); but all parts of the Constitution except the basic features can be amended by an Amendment Act passed under Art. 368, including the fundamental rights. This proposition has been established after a history of its own:

**Amendability** Fundamental Rights; **Basic Features.** 

A. Until the case of Golak Nath,<sup>17</sup> the Supreme Court had been of holding that no part of our Constitution was unamendable and that Parliament might, by passing a Constitution Amendment Act, in compliance with the requirements of Art. 368, amend any provision of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights and

Art. 368 itself.<sup>18</sup>

According to this earlier view,<sup>18</sup> thus, the Courts could act as the guardian of fundamental rights only so long as they were not amended by the Parliament of India by the required majority of votes. In fact, some of the amendments of the Constitution so far made were effected with a view to superseding judicial pronouncements which had invalidated social or economic legislation on the ground of contravention of fundamental rights. Thus, the narrow interpretation of Cl. (2) of Art. 19 by the Supreme Court in<br>the cases of Ramesh Thappar v. State of Madras<sup>19</sup> and Brij Bhushan v. State of Delhi<sup>20</sup> was superseded by the Constitution (1st Amendment) Act, 1951, while the interpretation given to Art. 31 in the cases of State of West Bengal v. Gopal,<sup>21</sup> Dwarkadas v. Sholapur Spinning Co.,<sup>22</sup> and State of West Bengal v. Bela Banerjee,<sup>23</sup> was superseded by the Constitution (4th Amendment) Act, 1955.

B. But the Supreme Court cried halt to the process of amending the Fundamental Rights through the amending procedure laid down in Art. 368 of the Constitution, by its much-debated decision in Golak Nath v. State of Punjab.<sup>17</sup> In this case,<sup>17</sup> overruling its two earlier decisions,<sup>18</sup> the Supreme Court held that Fundamental Rights, embodied in Part III, had been given a 'transcendental position' by the Constitution, so that no authority functioning

#### **CHAP. 8** FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

under the Constitution, including Parliament exercising the amending power under Art. 368, was competent to amend the Fundamental Rights.

C. But by the 24th Ameridment Act, 1971, Arts. 13 and 368 were amended to make it clear that Fundamental Rights were amendable under the procedure laid down in Art. 368, thus overriding the majority decision of the Supreme Court in Golak Nath v. State of Punjab.17

The majority decision in Kesavananda Bharati's case<sup>17</sup> upheld the validity of these amendments and also overruled Golak Nath's case,<sup>17</sup> holding that it is competent for Parliament to amend Fundamental Rights under Art. 368, which does not make any exception in favour of fundamental<br>rights; nor does Art. 13 comprehend Acts amending the Constitution itself.<br>At the same time *Kesavananda's* case<sup>7</sup> also laid down that there were implie limitations on the power to 'amend' and that power cannot be used to alter the 'basic features' of the Constitution.

A big limitation that stands in the way of Parliament, acting by a special majority, to introduce drastic changes in the Constitution, is the judicially innovated doctrine of 'basic features' which can be eliminated only if a Bench larger than the '13-Judge Bench in *Kesavananda's* case<sup>17</sup> be prepared to overturn the decision in that case. In the meantime, applying Kesavananda,<sup>17</sup> the majority of the Constitution Bench has invalidated Cls. (4) and (5) of Art. 368 as violative of the basic features of the Constitution [Minerva Mills v. Union of India, AIR 1980 S.C. 1789 (paras 21, 28)].

The provisions of Part III of our Constitution which enumerate the Classification of Fundamental Rights are more elaborate than those of any other existing written constitution relating to **Fundamental** Rights. fundamental rights, and cover a wide range of topics.

I. The Constitution itself classifies the Fundamental Rights under seven groups as follows:

(a) Right to equality.

- (b) Right to particular freedoms.
- (c) Right against exploitation.
- (d) Right to freedom of religion.
- (e) Cultural and educational rights.

(e) Cuntural and educational rights.<br>
(f) Right to property.<br>
(g) Right to constitutional remedies.

Of these the Right to Property has been elimi-Right to property nated by the 44th Amendment Act, so that only six omitted. freedoms now remain, in Art. 19(1) [see under '44th Amendment', ante].

The rights falling under each of the six categories are shown in Table V.

II. Another classification which is obvious is from the point of view of persons to whom they are available. Thus-

(a) Some of the fundamental rights are granted only to citizens-(i) Protection from discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth  $[Art. 15]$ ; (ii) Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment [Art. 16]; (iii) Freedoms of speech, assembly, association, movement, residence and profession [Art. 19]; (iv) Cultural and educational rights of minorities [Art. 30].

(b) Some of the fundamental rights, on the other hand, are available to any person on the soil of India-citizen or foreigner-(i) Equality before the law and equal protection of the Laws [Art. 14]; (ii) Protection in respect of conviction against ex post facto laws, double punishment and self-<br>incrimination [Art. 20]; (iii) Protection of life and personal liberty against action without authority of law  $[Art. 21]$ ; (iv) Right against exploitation  $[Art. 23]$ ; (v) Freedom of religion  $[Art. 25]$ ; (vi) Freedom as to payment of taxes for the promotion of any particular religion [Art. 27]; (vii) Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or worship in State educational institutions [Art. 28].

III. Some of the Fundamental Rights are negatively worded, as prohibitions to the State, e.g., Art. 14 says—"The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law. ..." Similar are the provisions of Arts. 15(1); 16(2); 18(1); 20, 22(1); 28(1). There are others, which positively confer some benefits upon the individual [e.g., the right to religious freedom, under Art. 25, and the cultural and educational rights, under Arts. 29(1), 30(1)].

IV. Still another classification may be made from the standpoint of the extent of limitation imposed by the different fundamental rights upon legislative power.

(i) On the one hand, we have some fundamental rights, such as under Art. 21, which are addressed against the Executive but impose no limitation upon the Legislature at all. Thus, Art. 21 simply says that-

"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law."

It was early held by our Supreme Court<sup>9</sup> that a competent Legislature is entitled to lay down any procedure for the deprivation of personal liberty, and that the Courts cannot interfere with such law on the ground that it is unjust, unfair or unreasonable. In this view,<sup>9</sup> the object of Art. 21 is not to impose any limitation upon the legislative power but only to ensure that the Executive does not take away a man's liberty except under the authority of a valid law, and in strict conformity with the procedure laid down by such law.<sup>23</sup> In later cases, however, the Supreme Court has found it difficult to immunise laws made under Art. 21 from attack on the ground of 'unreasonableness' under a relevant clause of Art. 19(1), or Art. 14, and recent Supreme Court decisions show an increasing inclination in that direction. $2$ 

(ii) To the other extreme are Fundamental Rights which are intended as absolute limitations upon the legislative power so that it is not open to the Legislature to regulate the exercise of such rights, e.g., the rights guaranteed by Arts. 15, 17, 18, 20, 24.

### FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES CHAP. 8

(iii) In between the two classes stand the rights guaranteed by Art. 19 which itself empowers the Legislature to impose reasonable restrictions upon the exercise of these rights, in the public interest. Though the individual rights guaranteed by Art. 19 are, in general, binding upon both the Executive and the Legislature, these 'authorities' are permitted by the Constitution to make valid exceptions to the rights within limits imposed by the Constitution. Such grounds, in brief, are security of the State, public order, public morality and the like.

All the above rights are available against the State. It is now settled that

Fundamental Rights-a guaran-<br>tee against State action.

the rights which are guaranteed by Arts.  $19^{25}$  and  $21^{26}$ are guaranteed against State action as distinguished from violation of such rights by private individuals. In case of violation of such rights by individuals, the ordinary legal remedies may be available but not the

constitutional remedies.

'State action', in this context, must, however, be understood in a wider sense. For interpreting the words 'State' wherever it occurs in the Part on Fundamental Rights, a definition has been given in Art. 12 which says that, unless the context otherwise requires, 'the State' will include not only the Executive and Legislative organs of the Union and the States, but also local bodies (such as municipal authorities) as well as 'other authorities'.<sup>27</sup> This latter expression refers to any authority or body of persons exercising the power to issue orders, rules, bye-laws or regulations having the force of law, e.g., a Board having the power to issue statutory rules, or exercising governmental powers. Even the act of a private individual may become an act of the State if it is enforced or aided by any of the authorities just referred to.<sup>28</sup>

It should be noted, however, that there are certain rights included in Part III which are available not only against the State but also against private individuals, e.g., Art. 15(2) [equality in regard to access to and use of places of public resort]; Art. 17 [prohibition of untouchability]; Art. 18(3)-(4) [prohibition of acceptance of foreign title]; Art. 23 [prohibition of traffic in human beings]; Art. 24 [prohibition of employment of children in hazardous employment]. But these provisions in Part III are not self-executory, that is to say, these articles are not directly enforceable; they would be indirectly enforceable; only if some law is made to give effect to them, and such law is violated. It follows that the classification of fundamental rights into executory and self-executory is another possible mode of classification.

We may now proceed to a survey of the various fundamental rights, in particular.

Article 14 of the Constitution provides-

"The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India."

Prima facie, the expression 'equality before the law' and 'equal protec-

equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law,-equal protection of the laws is a more *positive* concept, implying the right to equality of treatment in

The concept of equality and equal protection of laws in its proper spectrum encompasses social and economic justice in a political demo-

the concept of Rule of Law for all round evaluation of healthy social order.<sup>31</sup> The doctrine of equality before law is a necessary corollary to the concept of the rule of law.<sup>32</sup> It is a declaration of equality of all persons within the territory of India, implying thereby the absence of any privilege in favour of any individual.<sup>33</sup> It means that no man is above the law of the land and that every person, whatever be his rank or status, is<br>subject to the ordinary law and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals. Against, every citizen from the Prime Minister down to the humblest peasant, is under the same responsibility for every act done by him without lawful justification nd in this respect, there is no distinction between officials and private citizens. It follows that the position will be the same in India. But even in England, certain exceptions are recognised to the above rule of equality in the public interests.

The concept of equality before law does not involve the idea of absolute equality amongst all, which may be a physical impossibility. Art. 14 guarantees the similarity of treatment and not identical treatment. Art. 14 does not require that the legislative classification should be scientifically or logically perfect.<sup>34</sup> Classification for the purpose of legislation cannot be done with mathematical precision. The legislature enjoys considerable latitude while exercising its wisdom taking into consideration myriad circumstances, enriched by its experience and strengthened by people's will. So long as the classification can withstand the test of Art. 14, it cannot be questioned why one subject was included and the other left out and why one was given more benefit than the other.<sup>35</sup> The concept of equality permits rational or discriminating discrimination. Conferment of special benefits or protection or rights to a particular group of citizens for rational reasons is envisaged under Art. 14 and is implicit in the concept of equality.<sup>36</sup>

The exceptions allowed by the Indian Constitution are-

(1) The President or the Governor of a State shall not be answerable to any Court for the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of those powers and duties.

(2) No criminal proceeding whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the President or a Governor in any Court during his term of office.

(3) No civil proceeding in which relief is claimed against the President or the Governor of a State shall be instituted during his term of office in any court in respect of any act done or purporting to be done by him in his

personal capacity, whether before or after he entered upon his office as President or Governor of such State, until the expiration of two months next after notice in writing has been delivered to the President or the Governor, as the case may be, or left at his office stating the nature of the proceedings, the cause of action therefor, the name, description any place of residence of the party by whom such proceedings are to be instituted and the relief which he claims [Art. 361].

The above immunities, however, shall not bar-(i) Impeachment proceedings against the President. (ii) Suits or other appropriate proceedings against the Government of India or the Government of a State.

Besides the above constitutional exceptions, there will, of course, remain the exceptions acknowledged by the commity of nations in every civilized country, e.g., in favour of foreign Sovereigns and ambassadors.

Equal protection of the laws, on the other hand, **Equal** Protection would mean "that among equals, the law should be of the Laws. equal and equally administered, that likes should be treated alike. . ." Equal protection requires affirmative action by the State towards unequals by providing facilities and opportunities.<sup>37</sup>

In other words, it means the right to equal treatment in similar circumstances both in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed by the laws.<sup>38</sup> Art. 14 proceeds on the premise that equality of treatment is required to be given to persons who are equally circumstanced. Implicit in the concept of equality is the concept that the persons who are in fact unequally circumstanced, cannot be treated on a par.<sup>39</sup> However, unequals cannot be clulbbed.<sup>40</sup> None should be favoured and none should be placed under any disadvantage, in circumstances that do not admit of any reasonable justification for a different treatment. Thus, it does not mean that every person shall be taxed equally, but that persons under the same character should be taxed by the same standard. What Article 14 prohibits is "class legislation" and not "classification for purpose of legislation". The legislature can classify persons for legislative purposes so as to bring them under a welldefined class. A classification would be justified unless it is patently arbitrary. If there is equality and uniformity in each group, the law would not become discriminatory though due to some fortuitous circumstances some included in a class get an advantage over others, but they should not be singled out for special treatment.<sup>41</sup> The classification should not be arbitrary; it should be reasonable and be based on qualities and characteristics that have relation to the object of legislation.  $^{42}$ 

But if there is any reasonable basis for classification, the Legislature would be entitled to make a different treatment. The legislature is competent to exercise its discretion and make classification.<sup>43</sup> It is for the legislature to identify the class of the people to be given protection and on what basis such protection was to be given. The Court cannot interfere.<sup>44</sup> State has wide discretion in respect of classification of objects, persons and things for the purposes of taxation.<sup>45</sup> The Legislature can devise classes for the purpose of taxing or not taxing, exempting or not exempting, granting incentives and prescribing rate of tax, benefits or concessions.<sup>46</sup> Thus, it may (i) exempt **INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA** [CHAP. 8]

certain classes of property from taxation at all, such as charities, libraries and the like; (ii) impose different specific taxes upon different trades and professions; (iii) tax real and personal property in different manner and so on.

The guarantee of 'equal protection', thus, is a guarantee of equal treatment of persons in 'equal circumstances', permitting differentiation in different circumstances. In other words-

The principle of equality does not mean that every law must have universal application for all persons who are not by nature, attainment or circumstance in the same position as the varying needs of different classes of persons often require separate treatment.<sup>47</sup>

The principle does not take away from the State the power of classifying persons for legitimate purposes.  $^{48}$ 

"A Legislature which has to deal with diverse problems arising out of an infinite variety of human relations must, of necessity, have the power of making special laws to attain particular objects; and for that purpose it must have large powers of selection or classification of persons and things upon which such laws are to operate "48 operate."

In order to be 'reasonable', a classification must not be arbitrary, but must be rational, that is to say, it must not only be based on some qualities or characteristics which are to be found in all the persons grouped together and not in others who are left out but those qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation.<sup>49</sup> The reasonableness of a provision depends upon the circumstances obtaining at a particular time and the urgency of the evil sought to be controlled. The possibility of the power being abused is no ground for declaring a provision violative of Art. 14.50 In order to pass the test, two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, that (1) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others, and (2) that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act.<sup>38</sup>

It is not possible to exhaust the circumstances or criteria which may accord a reasonable basis for classification in all cases. It depends on the object of the legislation in view and whatever has a reasonable relation to the object or purpose of the legislation is a reasonable basis for classification of the persons or things coming under the purview of the enactment. Thus-

- (i) The basis of classification may be geographical.<sup>47</sup>
- (ii) The classification may be according to difference in time.<sup>47</sup>
  - (iii) The classification may be based on the difference in the nature of the trade, calling or occupation, which is sought to be regulated by the legislation.<sup>51</sup>

Similarly, higher educational qualification is a permissible basis of classification for promotion<sup>52</sup> as it has nexus with higher efficiency on the promotional post.<sup>53</sup>

Thus, it has been held that-

(a) In offences relating to women, e.g., adultery, women in India may be placed in a more favourable position, having regard to their social status and need for protection<sup>54</sup> (see under Art. 15, *post*).

(b) In a law of prohibition, it would not be unconstitutional to differentiate between civil and military personnel, or between foreign visitors and Indian citizens,—for they are not similarly circumstanced from the standpoint of need for prohibition of consumption of liquor.<sup>55</sup>

(c) Exemption to the candidate who stood first in the Forest Rangers College from selection as Assistant Conservator by the Public Service Commission, it being based on reasonable classification, is not *ultra vires* Art.  $14.56$ 

The guarantee of equal protection applies against substantive as well as procedural laws.<sup>57</sup> The decision making process should be transparent, fair and open.<sup>58</sup> The procedure for distribution of State largesses must be transparent, just, fair and non-arbitrary. Non-transparency promotes<br>nepotism and arbitrariness.<sup>59</sup> The role model for governance and decision taken thereof should manifest equity, fair play and justice. The cardinal principle of governance in a civilized society based on rule of law not only has to base on transparency but must create an impression that the decisionmaking was motivated on the consideration of probity. The Govt. has to rise above the nexus of vested interests and nepotism and eschew windowdressing. The act of governance has to withstand the test of judiciousness and impartiality and avoid arbitrary or capricious actions.<sup>60</sup> Hence the discretion vested by a statute is to be exercised fairly and judicially and not arbitrarily<sup>61</sup> but subject to the requirements of law.<sup>62</sup> In the absence of rules, the action of the government is required to be fair and reasonable.<sup>63</sup> From the standpoint of the latter, it means that all litigants, who are similarly situated, are able to avail themselves of the same procedural rights for relief and for defence, without discrimination. Of course, if the differences are of a minor or unsubstantial character, which have not prejudiced the interests of the person or persons affected, there would not be a denial of equal protection.<sup>38</sup> Again, a procedure different from that laid down by the ordinary law can be prescribed for a particular class of persons if the discrimination is based upon a reasonable classification having regard to the object which the legislation has in view and the policy underlying it. Thus, in a law which provides for the externment of undesirable persons who are likely to jeopardize the peace of the locality, it is not an unreasonable discrimination to provide that a suspected person shall have no right to cross-examine the witnesses who depose against him, for the very object of the legislation which is an extraordinary one would be defeated if such a right were given to the suspected person.<sup>64</sup> In the Reference on the Special Courts Bill, 1978,<sup>65</sup> the Supreme Court has held that the setting up of a Special Court for the expeditious trial of offences committed during the Emergency period [from 25-6-1975 to 27-3-1977] by high public officials, in view of the congestion of work in the ordinary Criminal Courts and in view of the need for a speedy termination of such prosecutions in the interests of the functioning of democracy under the Constitution of India, is a reasonable classification. But to include in the Bill any offence committed during any period prior to the Proclamation of Emergency in June, 1975, was unconstitutional inasmuch as such classification has no reasonable nexus with the object of the Bill.

Any procedure which comes in the way of a party in getting a fair trial would be violative of Art. 14.<sup>66</sup>

**INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA** [CHAP. 8]

The guarantee of equal protection includes absence of any arbitrary discrimination by the laws themselves or in the matter of their *administration*. Thus, even where a statute itself is not discriminatory, but the public official entrusted with the duty of carrying it into operation applies it against an individual, not for the purpose of the Act but intentionally for the purpose of injuring him, the latter may have that executive act annulled by the Court on the ground of contravention of the guarantee of equal protection. Of course, it is for the aggrieved individual to establish beyond doubt that the law was applied against him by the public authority "with an evil eye and an unequal hand".<sup>38</sup> Wide discretionary power conferred by a statute on any authority must be exercised reasonably in furtherance of public policy and for the public good and the public cause. The authority must record reasons for the said exercise of power even if the statute does not expressly enjoin upon the authority to do so.<sup>67</sup> The action of "State" must satisfy the principal requirements of Art. 14 viz. treating persons similarly situated equally and grant of equal protection to them. Reasonableness and fairness is the heart and soul of Art. 14.68 In short, Art. 14 hits 'arbitrariness' of State action in any form.<sup>24, 69</sup>

An act which is discriminatory is liable to be labelled as arbitrary.<sup>70</sup>

The court will not interfere in the policy decisions of the Govt. unless the government-action is arbitrary or invidiously discriminatory.<sup>71</sup> The Government policy is not subject to judicial review unless it is demonstrably arbitrary, capricious, irrational, discriminatory or violative of constitutional or statutory provisions.<sup>72</sup>

Two wrongs do not make a right. A party cannot claim that, since something wrong has been done; direction should be given to do another wrong. It would not be setting a wrong right but would be perpetuating another wrong. In such matters there is no discrimination involved. The concept of equal treatment presupposes the existence of similar legal foothold and does not countenance repetition of a wrong action to bring forth wrongs on a par.<sup>73</sup>

It is the duty of State to allay fears of citizens regarding discrimination and arbitrariness.<sup>74</sup> However, protective discrimination in favour of SCs and STs is a part of constitutional scheme of social and economic justice<sup>75</sup> to integrate them into the national mainstream so as to establish an integrated social order with equal dignity of person.<sup>76</sup>

As the Supreme Court has observed,<sup>77</sup> Articles **Relation** between 14-16, taken together, enshrine the principle of Arts. 14-16. equality and absence of discrimination.

While the principle is generally stated in Article 14, which extends to all persons,—citizens or aliens, Articles 15 and 16 deal with particular aspects of that equality. Thus,

(a) Art. 15 is available to citizens only and it prohibits discrimination against any citizen in any matter at the disposal of the State on any of the specified grounds, namely, religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.

## CHAP. 8 FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

Art.

(b) Art. 16 is also confined to citizens, but it is restricted to one aspect of public discrimination, namely, employment under the State.

In matters not coming under Arts. 15 and 16, if there is any discrimination, the validity of that can be challenged under the general provision in Art. 14.

As just stated, a particular aspect of the equality guaranteed by Art. 14 is the prohibition against discrimination contained in Art. 15 of the Constitution which runs thus:

"(1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.

(2) No citizen shall on grounds only of religion, race, 15: Prohibicaste, sex, place of birth or any of them be subject to any tion of Discriminadisability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to tion on grounds of

(a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places Religion, Race. Caste, Sex or Place of public entertainment; or

**rth.** (b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated of Birth. to the use of general public.

(3) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children.

(4) Nothing in this article or in clause (2) of article 29 shall prevent the State<br>from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and<br>educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled C

(5) Nothing in this article or in sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of article 19 shall<br>prevent the State from making any special provision, by law, for the advancement<br>of any socially and educationally backward classes of cit

It will be seen that the scope of this Article is very wide. While the prohibition in Cl. (1) is levelled against State action, the prohibition in Cl. (2) is levelled against individuals as well.

Cl. (1) says that any act of the State, whether political, civil or otherwise, shall not discriminate as between citizens on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them. The plain meaning of this prohibition is that no person of a particular religion, caste, etc., shall be treated unfavourably by the State when compared with persons of any other religion or caste merely on the ground that he belongs to the particular religion or caste, etc. The significance of the word 'only' is that if there is any other ground or consideration for the differential treatment besides those prohibited by this Article, the discrimination will not be unconstitutional.<sup>54</sup> Thus, discrimination in favour of a particular sex will be permissible if the classification is the result of other considerations besides the fact that the person belongs to that sex, e.g., physical or intellectual fitness for some work. For instance, women may be considered to be better fitted for the job of a nurse while they may not be considered eligible for employment in heavy industries like a steel factory. Such discrimination, being based on a ground other than sex, would not be considered to be unconstitutional.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 8

But if a person is sought to be discriminated against simply because he belongs to a particular community, race or sex, he can get the State action annulled through a Court. While racial discrimination still persists as a malignant growth upon Western society, it speaks volumes for Indian achievement that a possible victim of racial discrimination, in India, can obtain relief direct from the highest Court of the land, by means of a petition for an appropriate writ, and, yet, no such complaint has so far come before the Courts.

As already stated, in regard to the public places specified in Cl. (2), the protection is available even against discriminatory acts by private individuals. Clause (2) provides that so far as places of public entertainment are concerned, no person shall be subjected to discrimination on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, whether such discrimination is the result of an act of the State or of any other individual. Even wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads, and places of public resort which are owned by private individuals are subject to this prohibition provided they are maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or they have been dedicated to the use of the general public.

The above prohibitions against discrimination, however, would not preclude the State from-

(a) making special provision for women and children;

(b) making special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.

These exceptional classes of people require special protection and hence any legislation which is necessary for the making of special provisions for persons of these classes, would not be held to be unconstitutional. Thus, it has been held that s. 497 of the Indian Penal Code, which says that in an offence of adultery though the man is punishable for adultery, the woman is not punishable as an abettor, is not unconstitutional, because such immunity is necessary for the protection of women in view of their existing position in Indian society.<sup>54</sup>

Similarly, though discrimination on the ground of caste only is prohibited by Cl. (1) of the Article, it would be permissible under Cl. (4) for the State to reserve seats for the members of the backward classes or of the Scheduled Castes or Tribes or to grant them fee concessions, in public educational institutions.<sup>78</sup> Art. 15(4) envisages the policy of compensatory or protective discrimination but it should be reasonable and consistent with the ultimate public interest  $i.e.,$  national interest and the interest of community or society as a whole<sup>79</sup> but the provision cannot be justifiably invoked in granting remission to the convicted persons belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes as it would not be a measure for their 'advancement'. However, the benefit obtained was permitted to be retained.80 It was held that an SC/ST candidate selected for admission to a course on the basis of merit as a general candidate, should not be treated as a reserved candidate<sup>81</sup> and reservation for admission to the specialities/ super-spe-

## FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES CHAP. 8

cialities in post-graduate and doctoral course in medicine is permissible.<sup>82</sup> Cl. (5) was inserted by the Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment) Act, 2005 with effect from 20.1.2006. It empowers the State to make special provision, by law, for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes regarding their admission to educational institutions including private ones whether aided or unaided by the State, excepting the minority institutions.

As a corollary from the general assurance of absence of discrimination Art. 16: Equality by the State on grounds only of religion, race, caste, of opportunity in sex, or place of birth [Art. 15], the Constitution<br>matters of Public guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public<br>Employment Employment. employment. Article 16 says that-

"(1) There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State.

(2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or any of then, be ineligible for . . . . any office under the State."

The expression "matters relating to employment or appointment" contained in Art. 16(1) includes all matters in relation to employment both prior and subsequent to the employment which are incidental to the employment and form part of the terms and conditions of such employment.<sup>83</sup>

The true import of equality of opportunity is not simply a matter of legal equality. Its existence depends not merely on the absence of disabilities but on the presence of abilities and opportunity of excellence in each cadre/grade<sup>84</sup> as equality of opportunity means equality as between the members of the same class of employees and not between that of separate independent classes.<sup>85</sup> All persons similarly situated should be treated similarly. Only because one person has approached the court that would not mean the persons similarly situated should be treated differently.<sup>86</sup> When regular vacancies in posts are to be filled up, a regular process of recruitment or appointment has to be resorted to as per the constitutional scheme, and cannot be done in a haphazard manner based on patronage or other considerations. Hence, appointment / recruitment of temporary, contractual, casual, daily-wage or ad hoc employment dehors the constitutional scheme cannot be regularised. Such appointees cannot claim to be made permanent.<sup>87</sup> Like other employers, the government is also entitled to pick and choose from amongst a large number of candidates offering themselves for employment. But this can be done on one condition, that all the applicants must be given an equal opportunity along with others who qualify for the same post. The selection test must not be arbitrary and technical qualifications and standards should be prescribed where necessary.<sup>88</sup>

A person cannot be excluded from a State service merely because he is a Brahim, 89 even though this result is reached by reason of a distribution of posts amongst communities according to a ratio or quota.<sup>89</sup> Government jobs or service cannot be denied to the persons suffering from AIDS.90 This equality is to be observed by the State not only in the matter of appointments to the public services, but also in the matter of any other public employment, where the relationship of master and servant exists between the State and the employee.<sup>91</sup> It bars discrimination not only in the matter of

INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 8]

initial appointment but also of promotion and termination of the service itself<sup>92</sup> as "employment" includes promotion.<sup>93</sup>

This right is a safeguard not only against communal discrimination, but also against local discrimination or even against discrimination against the weaker sex.

The right to be considered for promotion by the Departmental Promotion Committee is a fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 16, provided a person is eligible and is in the zone of consideration;<sup>94</sup> but the "consideration" must be "fair" according to established principles governing service jurisprudence.<sup>95</sup>

The only exceptions to the above rule of equality are-

(a) Residence within the State may be laid down by Parliament as a condition for particular classes of employment of appointment under any State or other local authority [Art. 16(3)].

By virtue of this power, Parliament enacted the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, empowering the Government of India to prescribe residence as condition for employment in certain posts and services in the State of Andhra Pradesh and in the Union Territories of Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura. This Act having expired in 1974, there is no provision to prescribe residence as a condition for public employment, except that for Andhra Pradesh special provisions have been made by inserting a new Art. 371D (post) in the Constitution itself.

(b) The State may reserve any post or appointment in favour of any backward class of citizens who, in the opinion of the State, are not adequately represented in the services under that State  $[Art. 16(4)].$  This is to provide socio-economic equality to the disadvantaged.<sup>96</sup> The expression "backward class of citizens" contained in Art.  $16(4)$  would take Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes within its purview.<sup>97</sup>

(c) Offices connected with a religious or denominated institution may be reserved for members professing the particular religion or belonging to the particular denomination to which the institution relates  $[Art. 16(5)]$ .

(d) The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration in the matter of appointment to services and posts under the Union and the States, as far as may be consistent with the maintenance of efficiency of the administration  $[Art. 335]$ but the proviso<sup>98</sup> to Art. 335 providing for giving relaxation in qualifying marks in any examination or lowering the standard of evaluation in favour of the members of the SC & ST hits the consideration of maintenance of efficiency in administration and has done away with the emphasis on it laid down by the Apex Court in some cases.<sup>99</sup> The Supreme Court has held<sup>100</sup> that while Art. 16(4) is apparently without any limitation upon the power of reservation conferred by it, it has to be read together with Art. 335 which enjoins that in taking into consideration the claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the making of appointments in connection with the affairs of the Union or a State, the policy of the State should be consistent with "the maintenance of efficiency of administration".<sup>100</sup> The result is that—

"There can be no doubt that the Constitution-makers assumed. . .that while making adequate reservation under article 16(4) care would be taken not to provide for unreasonable, excessive or extravagant reservation. . . Therefore, like the special provision improperly made under article 15(4), reservation made under article 16(4) beyond the permissible and legitimate limits would be liable to be challenged as a *fraud on the Constitution*.<sup>"101</sup>

However, the Constitution (Eighty-second Amendment) Act, 2000 inserted a proviso to Art. 335 almost closing the door for consideration of maintenance of efficiency of administration in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State inasmuch as the proviso empowered the State to relax the qualifying marks in any examination or lower the standards of evaluation, for reservation in matters of promotions of the members of the SC/ST to any classes of services or posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or a State.

It is to be noted carefully that the prohibition against discrimination in the matter of public employment is attracted where the discrimination is based only on any of the grounds enumerated, namely, religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence. It does not prevent the State, like other employers, to pick and choose from a number of candidates, either for appointment or for promotion, on grounds of efficiency, discipline and the like.<sup>102</sup> It is also to be noted that though reservation in favour of backward classes is permissible under Cl. (4) of Art. 16, no such reservation is possible in favour of women; nor is any other discrimination in favour of women possible, e.g., relaxation of rules of recruitment or standard of qualification or the like.

For the furtherance of social equality, the Constitution provides for the abolition of the evil of 'untouchability' (see Art. 17, post) and the prohibition of conferring titles by the State.

A nine-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court has in Indra Sawhney's The Mandal Commi case<sup>103</sup> (popularly known as the Mandal Commission case) laid down the following important points which ssion case. **Dellinut** summarise the law on the issue of reservations in

Government employment. [For further discussion, see Author's Shorter Constitution, 14th Ed., 2008 under Art. 16(4)].

1. Article 16(4) is exhaustive of the provisions that can be made in favour of the backward classes in the matter of employment.

2. Backward classes of citizens is not defined in the Constitution. There is an integral connection between caste, occupation, poverty and social backwardness. In the Indian context, lower castes are treated as backwards. A caste may by itself constitute a class.

3. The backward classes can be identified in Hindu society with reference to castes along with other criteria such as traditional occupation, poverty, place of residence, lack of education etc., and in communities where caste is not recognised the rest of the criteria would apply.

4. The backwardness contemplated by Art. 16(4) is mainly social. It need not be both social and educational.

## INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP, 8]

5. "Means-test" signifies imposition of an income limit for the purpose of excluding persons from the backward classes. Those whose income is above that limit are referred to as the 'creamy layer'. Income or the extent of property can be taken as a measure of social advancement and on that basis the 'creamy layer' of a given caste can be excluded.<sup>103</sup>

6. For getting reservations a class must be backward and should not be adequately represented in the services under the State.

7. The reservations contemplated in Art. 16(4) should not exceed 50%.

8. The rule of 50% should be applied to each year. It cannot be related to the total strength of the class, service or cadre etc.

9. Reservation of posts under Art. 16(4) is confined to initial appointment only and cannot extend to providing reservation in the matter of *promotion*. If a reservation in promotion exists it shall continue for 5 years (16 Nov. 1997). By the Constitution (77th Amendment) Act, 1995, this limitation of time has been removed by inserting Cl. (4A) to enable it to continue reservation in promotion for the S.C. and S.T.

10. Identification of backward classes is subject to judicial review.

Sub-division of Other Backward Classes contemplated in the Mandal Commission case is not applicable to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Hence sub-classification or subgrouping of SC & ST is not permitted.<sup>104</sup>

Art. 16(4) is an enabling provision and confers a discretionary power on the State to make reservation, if required, but it confers no constitutional right upon the members of the backward classes to claim reservation.<sup>105</sup>

The vacancies reserved could be 'carried forward' for a maximum period of three years if candidates from backward classes were not available afterwhich they were to lapse. By inserting Cl. (4B) in Art. 16 by the Constitution (81st Amendment) Act, 2000, the State has been empowered to consider such unfilled vacancies as a seperate class to be filled up in any succeeding year or years.

Art. 14 lays down the rule of equality in the widest term, while Art. 15 prohibits discrimination on the grounds specified Relative scope of

therein but covering the entire range of State activities. Arts. 14, 15 and 16. Art. 16 embodies the same rule but is narrower in

scope since it is confined to State activities relating to office or employment under the State. Both Arts. 15 and 16 operate subject to exceptions therein.<sup>106</sup>

Article 17 of the Constitution says-

Art. 17 : Abolition of Untouchability.

'Untouchability' is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of 'untouchability' shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law.

The vision of the founding fathers of the Constitution to liberate the society from blind and ritualistic adherence to mere traditional superstitious

## FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES **CHAP. 8**

beliefs sans reason or rational basis has found expression in the form of Art. 17.107

Parliament is authorised to make a law prescribing the punishment for this offence [Art. 35], and, in exercise of this power, Parliament has enacted the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955, which has been amended and renamed (in 1976) as the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955.

The word 'untouchability' has not, however, been defined either in the Constitution or in the above Act. It has been assumed that the word has a well-known connotation,—primarily referring to any social practice which looks down upon certain depressed classes solely on account of their birth and disables them from having any kind of intercourse with people belonging to the so-called higher classes or castes. The Act declares certain acts as offences, when done on the ground of 'untouchability', and prescribes the punishments therefor, e.g.

(a) refusing admission to any person to public institutions, such as hospital, dispensary, educational institution;

(b) preventing any person from worshipping or offering prayers in any place of public worship;

(c) subjecting any person to any disability with regard to access to any shop, public restaurant, hotel or public entertainment or with regard to the use of any reservoir, tap or other source of water, road, cremation ground or any other place where 'services are rendered to the public'.

The sweep of the Act has been enlarged in 1976, by including within the offence of practising untouchability, the following-

(i) insulting a member of a Scheduled Caste on the ground of untouchability;

(ii) preaching untouchability, directly or indirectly;

(iii) justifying untouchability on historical, philosophical or religious grounds or on the ground of tradition of the caste system.

The penal sanction has been enhanced by providing that (a) in the case of subsequent convictions, the punishment may range from one to two years' imprisonment; (b) a person convicted of the offence of 'untouchability' shall be disqualified for election to the Union or a State Legislature.

If a member of a Scheduled Caste is subjected to any such disability or discrimination, the Court shall presume, unless the contrary is proved, that such act was committed on the ground of 'untouchability'. In other words, in such cases, there will be a statutory presumption of an offence having been committed under this Act.

The prohibition of untouchability in the Constitution has thus been given a realistic and effective shape by this Act.

'Title' is something that hangs to one's name, as an appendage. During the British rule, there was a complaint from the Art. 18: Abolition nationalists that the power to confer titles was being of Titles. abused by the Government for imperialistic purposes

# INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA $[CHAP. 8]$

and for corrupting public life. The Constitution seeks to prevent such abuse by prohibiting the State from conferring any title at all.

# It is to be noted that-

(a) The ban operates only against the State. It does not prevent other public institutions, such as Universities, to confer titles or honours by way of honouring their leaders or men of merit.

(b) The State is not debarred from awarding military or academic distinctions, even though they may be used as titles.<sup>108</sup>

(c) The State is not prevented from conferring any distinction or award, say, for social service, which cannot be used as a title, that is, as an appendage to one's name. Thus, the award of Bharat Ratna or Padma Vibhushan cannot be used by the recipient as a title and does not, accordingly, come within the constitutional prohibition.

In 1954, the Government of India introduced decorations (in the form of medals) of four categories, namely, Bharat Ratna, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri. While the Bharat Ratna was to be awarded for "exceptional services towards the advancement of Art, Literature and Science, and in recognition of *public service* of the higher order", the others would be awarded for "distinguished public service in any field, including service rendered by Government servants", in order of the degree of the merit of their service.

Though the foregoing awards were mere decorations and not intended to be used as appendage to the names of the persons to whom they are awarded, there was a vehement criticism from some quarters that the introduction of these awards violated Art. 18. The critics pointed out that even though they may not be used as titles, the decorations tend to make distinctions according to rank, contrary to the Preamble which promises 'equality of status'. The critics gained strength on this point from the fact that the decorations are divided into several classes, superior and inferior, and that holders of the Bharat Ratna have been assigned a place in the 'Warrant of Precedence' (9th place,  $i.e.$ , just below the Cabinet Ministers of the Union), which is usually meant for indicating the rank of the different dignitaries and high officials of the State, in the interests of discipline in the administration. The result was the creation of a rank of persons on the basis of Government recognition, in the same way as the conferment of nobility would have done.

Another criticism, which seems to be legitimate, is that there is no sanction, either in the Constitution or in any existing law, against a recipient of any such decoration appending it to his name and, thus, using it as a title. Any such use is obviously inconsistent with the prohibition contained in Art. 18(1) but it is not made an offence either by the Constitution or by any law. The apprehensions of the critics on this point were unfortunately justified by the fact that in describing the author on the Title of an issue of the Hamlyn Lectures, the decoration 'Padma Vibhushan' was, in fact, appended as a title.

The protest raised by Acharya Kripalani against the award of such decorations, which went unheeded earlier was honoured by the Janata regime (1977),—by putting a stop to the practice of awarding Bharat Ratna, etc. by the Government. But it was restored by Mrs. Gandhi after her comeback.

In this context, it is to be noted that Art.  $18(1)$  itself makes an exception in favour of granting by the State of any *military*<sup>108</sup> or *academic* distinction.

The matter was taken to Court, and the Supreme Court has now held<sup>109</sup> that non-military awards by way of recognition of *merit* of *extraordinary work* (e.g., the Padma awards) are not titles of nobility and hence, do not violate Art. 14 or 18, provided they are not used as titles or prefixes or suffixes to the name of the awardee.

Apart from the rights flowing from the above prohibition, certain positive rights are conferred by the Constitution in order to promote the ideal of liberty held out by the Preamble. The foremost amongst these are the six fundamental rights in the nature of 'freedom' which are guaranteed to the citizens by the Constitution of India  $[Art. 19]$ . These were popularly

Art. 19: The Six known as the 'seven freedoms' under our Constitution. It has already been pointed out that in Freedoms. the original Constitution, there were 7 freedoms in

Art. 19(1) but that one of them, namely, 'the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property' has been *omitted* by the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978, leaving only 6 freedoms in this Article. They are-1. Freedom of speech and expression. 2. Freedom of assembly. 3. Freedom of association. 4. Freedom of movement. 5. Freedom of residence and settlement. 6. Freedom of profession, occupation, trade or business.

Since Art. 19 forms the core of our Chapter on Fundamental Rights, it is essential for the reader to be familiar with the text of this Article, as it stands amended:

"19. (1) All citizens shall have the right-

- (a) to freedom of speech and expression;
- (b) to assemble peaceably and without arms;
- (c) to form associations or unions;
- (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India;
- (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; and
- $(f)$  ... ...<sup>110</sup>
- $(g)$  to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.

(2) Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent the State from making any law, insofar as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.

(3) Nothing in sub-clause (b) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any (solid law insofar as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law<br>imposing, in the interests of the *sovereignty and integrity of India* or public order,<br>reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right confer

(4) Nothing in sub-clause (c) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA  $[CHAP. 8]$ 

imposing, in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order or morality, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause.

(5) Nothing in sub-clause (d)-(e) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub-clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe.

(6) Nothing in sub-clause  $(g)$  of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of the general public, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause, and, in particular, nothing in the said sub-clause, shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it relates to, or prevent the State from making any law relating to,-

(i) the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business, or

(ii) the carrying on by the State, or by a corporation owned or controlled by the State, of any trade, business, industry or service, whether to the exclusion, complete or partial, of citizens or otherwise."

Flying of National Flag is a symbol of expression coming within the preview of Art. 19(1)(a).<sup>111</sup> A voter's speech or expression in case of election would include casting of votes, that is to say, a voter speaks out or expresses by casting vote.<sup>112</sup> Right to information is an integral part of freedom of expression, particularly a voter's right to know the antecedents /assets of a candidate contesting election.<sup>113</sup> Right to speech implies the right to silence.<br>It implies freedom, not to listen, and not to be forced to listen.<sup>114</sup>

No citizen has a fundamental right under Art. 19(1)(c) to become a member of a voluntary association or a cooperative society. His right is governed by the provisions of the statute. So, the right to become or to continue being a member of the society is a statutory right.<sup>115</sup>

No citizen can claim to have trade in noxious or dangerous goods. Hence, intoxicating liquor being a noxious material, no citizen can claim any inherent right or privilege to sell intoxicating liquor by retail.<sup>116</sup> Education used to be charity or philanthropy in the good old times.<br>Gradually, it became an occupation.<sup>117</sup> The establishment and running of an educational institution where a large number of persons are employed as teachers or administrative staff, and an activity is carried on that results in imparting of knowledge to the students, must necessarily be regarded as an occupation, even if there is no element of profit generation. All citizens have a right to establish and administer educational institutions under Art.  $19(1)(g)$  and the minorities have a special right under Art. 30.<sup>118</sup>

Limitations upon the Freedoms.

Absolute individual rights cannot be guaranteed by any modern State. The guarantee of each of the above rights is, therefore limited by our Constitution itself by conferring upon the 'State' a power to impose by its laws reasonable

restrictions as may be necessary in the larger interests of the community. This is what is meant by saying that the Indian Constitution attempts "to strike a balance between individual liberty and social control".<sup>119</sup> Since the goal of our constitutional system is to establish a 'welfare State', the makers of the Constitution did not rest with the enumeration of uncontrolled individual rights, in accordance with the philosophy of laissez faire, but

#### CHAP. 81 FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

sought to ensure that where collective interests were concerned, individual liberty must yield to the common good; but, instead of leaving it to the Courts to determine the grounds and extent of permissible State regulation of individual rights as the American Constitution does, the makers of our Constitution specified the permissible limitations in Cls. (2) to (6) of Art. 19 itself.

The 'State', in this context, includes not only the legislative authorities of the Union and the States but also other local or statutory<sup>120</sup> authorities, e.g., municipalities, local boards, etc., within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. So, all of these authorities may impose restrictions upon the above freedoms, provided such restrictions are reasonable and are relatable to any of the grounds of public interest as specified in Cls. (2)-(6) of Art. 19.

Thus-

(i) The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression. But this freedom is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the State relating to (a) defamation; (b) contempt of court; (c) decency or morality; (d) security of the State; (e) friendly relations with foreign State; (f) incitement to an offence; (g) public order; (h) maintenance of the sovereignty and integrity of India.<sup>121</sup>

'Decency or morality' is not confined to sexual morality alone. It indicates that the action must be in conformity with the current standards of behaviour or propriety.<sup>122</sup> Hence, seeking votes at an election on the ground of the candidate's religion in a secular state, is against the norms of decency and propriety of the society.<sup>123</sup>

It is evident that freedom of speech and expression cannot confer upon an individual a licence to commit illegal or immoral acts or to incite others to overthrow the established government by force or unlawful means. No one can exercise his right of speech in such a manner as to violate another man's such right.<sup>124</sup>

(ii) Similarly, the freedom of *assembly* is subject to the qualification that the assembly must be peaceable and without arms and subject to such reasonable restrictions as may be imposed by the "State" in the interests of public order. In other words, the right of meeting or assembly shall not be liable to be abused so as to create public disorder or a breach of the peace, or to prejudice the sovereignty or integrity of India.<sup>121</sup>

(iii) Again, all citizens have the right to form associations or unions, but subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the State in the interests of public order or morality or the sovereignty or integrity of India. Thus, this freedom will not entitle any group of individuals to enter into a criminal conspiracy or to form any association dangerous to the public peace or to make illegal strikes or to commit a public disorder, or to undermine the sovereignty or integrity of India.<sup>125</sup>

(vi) Similarly, though every citizen shall have the right to move freely throughout the territory of India or to reside and settle in any part of the country,-this right shall be subject to restrictions imposed by the State in the interests of the general public or for the protection of any Scheduled Tribe.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA  $[CHAP. 8]$ 

(v) Again, every citizen has the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business, but subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the State in the interests of the general public and subject to any law laying down qualifications for carrying on any profession or technical occupation, or enabling the State itself to carry on any trade or business to the exclusion of the citizens.

As pointed out earlier, one of the striking features of the provisions relating to Fundamental Rights in our Constitution is **Scope for Judicial** that the very declaration of the major Fundamental Review.

Rights is attended with certain limitations specified by the Constitution itself. In the United States the Bill of Rights itself does not contain any such limitations to the rights of the individuals guaranteed thereby, but in the enforcement of those rights the courts had to invent doctrines like that of 'Police Power of the State' to impose limitations on the rights of the individual in the interests of the community at large. But, as explained above, in Art. 19 of our Constitution, there is a distinct clause attached to each of the rights declared, containing the limitations or restrictions which may be imposed by the State on the exercise of each of the rights so guaranteed. For example, while the freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed, an individual cannot use this freedom to defame another which constitutes an offence under the law. A law which may be made by the State under any of the specified grounds, such as public order, defamation, contempt of court, cannot be challenged as unconstitutional or inconsistent with the guarantee of freedom of expression except where the restrictions imposed by the law can be held to be "unreasonable" by a court of law.

That is how the competing interests of individual liberty and of public welfare have been sought to be reconciled by the framers of our Constitution. As MUKHERJEA, J. explained in the leading case of A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras<sup>119</sup>

"There cannot be any such thing as absolute or uncontrolled liberty wholly freed from restraint for that would lead to anarchy and disorder. The possession and enjoyment of all rights . . . are subject to such reasonable conditions as may be deemed to the governing authority of the country to be essential to the safety, health, peace, general order and morals of the community. The question, therefore, arises in each case of *adjusting the conflicting interests* of the individual and of the society.. . Ordinarily every man has the liberty to order his life as he pleases, to say what he will, to go where he will, to follow any trade, occupation or calling at his pleasure and to do any other thing which he can lawfully do without let or hindrance by any other person. On the other hand, for the very protection of these liberties the society must arm itself with certain powers. What the Constitution, therefore, attempts to do in declaring the rights of the people is to strike a balance between individual liberty and social security. Article 19 of the Constitution gives a list of individual liberties and prescribes in t may be placed upon them by law so that they may not conflict with public welfare<br>or general morality.<sup>119</sup>

It is by way of interpretation of the word 'reasonable' that the court comes into the field, and in each case when an individual complains to the court that his Fundamental Right has been infringed by the operation of a law, or an executive order issued under a law, the court has got to determine whether the restriction imposed by the law is reasonable and if it is

### **CHAP. 8** FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

held to be unreasonable in the opinion of the court, the court will declare the law (and the order, if any) to be unconstitutional and void.<sup>126</sup>

The expression 'reasonable restriction' seeks to strike a balance

Tests of Reason-Restriction.

đ

'n

between the freedom guaranteed by any of the subableness of a clauses of Art. 19(1) and the social control permitted by any of the exceptions in Cls.  $(2)$  to  $(6)$ . It is to be seen, therefore, what criteria or tests have been laid

down by the Supreme Court for determining whether the restriction is reasonable or not. The Supreme Court has said<sup>127-128</sup> that a restriction is reasonable only when there is a proper balance between the rights of the individual and those of the society.

The test of reasonableness should, therefore, be applied to each individual statute impugned and not abstract or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases. The nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the *disproportion* of the imposition, the *prevailing conditions* at the time, should all enter into the judicial verdict.<sup>129</sup> Thus, the formula of subjective satisfaction of the Government and its officers with an advisory Board to review the materials on which the Government seeks to override a basic freedom guaranteed to the citizen, may be viewed as reasonable only in very exceptional circumstances (e.g., in providing internment or externment for the security of the State), and within the narrowest limits, and not to curtail a right such as the freedom of association, in the absence of any emergent or extraordinary circumstances.<sup>129</sup> All the attendant circumstances must be taken into consideration and one cannot dissociate the actual contents of the restrictions from the manner of their imposition or the mode of putting them into practice.<sup>130</sup>

The Supreme Court has held that in examining the reasonableness of a statutory provision, whether it violated the fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 19, one has to keep in mind:

(1) The Directive Principles of the State Policy.

(2) The restrictions must not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature, going beyond the requirement of the interest of the general public.

(3) No abstract or general pattern or a mixed principle to judge the reasonableness of the restrictions can be laid down so as to be of universal application and the same will vary from case to case as also with regard to the changing conditions, values of human life, social philosophy of the constitution, prevailing conditions and surrounding circumstances.

(4) A just balance has to be struck between the restrictions imposed and social control envisaged by Art. 19(6).

(5) Prevailing social values as also social needs which are intended to be satisfied by the restrictions.

(6) There must be a direct and proximate nexus or reasonable connection between the restrictions imposed and the object sought to be achieved
INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA  $[CHAP. 8]$ 

by the Act, that being so a strong presumption in favour of the constitutionality of the Act will naturally arise.<sup>131</sup>

It follows, therefore, that the question of reasonableness should be determined from both the substantive and procedural standpoints. Hence,-

(a) In order to be reasonable, the restriction imposed must have a

**Substantive** and **Procedural** reasonableness.

reasonable relation to the collective object which the legislation seeks to achieve and must not go in excess of that object, or, in other words, the restriction must not be greater than the mischief to be prevented.

Legislation which arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness.<sup>128</sup> Thus,—

The object of an Act was "to provide measures for the supply of adequate labour for agricultural proposes in *bidi* manufacturing areas". But the order of the Deputy Commissioner made thereunder forbade *all* persons resid villages from engaging in the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season. The Supreme Court invalidated the order on the ground that it imposed an unreasonable restriction upon the freedom of business  $[Art. 19(1)(g)]$  of those engaged in the manufacture of bidis because

The object of the Act could be achieved by legislation restraining the employment of *agricultural* labour in the manufacture of bidis *during the agricultural season* or by regulating hours of work on the business of maki A total prohibition of the manufacture imposes an unreasonable and excessive restriction on the lawful occupation of manufacturing bidis.<sup>128</sup>

(b) While the foregoing aspect may be said to be the substantive aspect of reasonableness, there is another aspect, viz., the procedural aspect,-relating to the manner in which the restrictions have been imposed. That is to say, in order to be reasonable, not only the restriction must not be excessive, the procedure or manner of imposition of the restriction must also be fair and just. In order to determine whether the restrictions imposed by a law are procedurally reasonable, the court must take into consideration all the attendant circumstances such as the manner of its imposition, the mode of putting it into practice. Broadly speaking, a restriction is unreasonable if it is imposed in a manner which violates the principles of natural justice, for example, if it seeks to curtail the right of association or the freedom of business of a citizen without giving him an opportunity to be heard.<sup>132</sup> It has also been laid down that in the absence of extraordinary circumstances it would be unreasonable to make the exercise of a fundamental right depend on the subjective satisfaction of the Executive.<sup>130</sup>

There is no specific provision in our Constitution guaranteeing the Freedom of the freedom of the press because freedom of the press is included<sup>133</sup> in the wider freedom of 'expression' which Press. is guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a). Freedom of expression

means the freedom to express not only one's own views but also the views of others and, by any means, including printing. But since the freedom of expression is not an absolute freedom and is subject to the limitations contained in Cl. (2) of Art. 19, laws may be passed by the State imposing reasonable restrictions on the freedom of the press in the interests of the security of the State, the sovereignty and integrity of India, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or for the prevention of contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence. Absolute,

## FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES **CHAP. 8**

unlimited and unfettered freedom of press at all times and in all the circumstances would lead to disorder and anarchy.<sup>134</sup>

The newspapers serve as a medium of exercise of freedom of speech.<sup>135</sup> Any expression of opinion would not be immune from the liability for exceeding the limits. If a citizen, in the garb of exercising the right of free expression in Art. 19(1) tries to scandalise the Court or undermines the dignity of the Court, then the Court would be entitled to exercise the power under contempt provisions.<sup>136</sup>

The Press, as such, has no special privileges in India. From the fact that the measure of the freedom of the Press is the same as that of an ordinary citizen under Art. 19(1)(a), several propositions emerge<sup>133</sup>-

I. The Press is not immune from-

- (a) the ordinary forms of taxation;
- (b) the application of the general laws relating to industrial relations;
- (c) the regulation of the conditions of service of the employees.

II. But in view of the guarantee of freedom of expression, it would not be legitimate for the State-

(a) to subject the Press to laws which take away or abridge the freedom of expression or which would curtail circulation<sup>137</sup> and thereby narrow the scope of dissemination of information or fetter its freedom to choose its means of exercising the right  $\emph{or}$  would undermine its independence by driving it to seek Government  $\rm aid;^{137}$ 

(b) to single out the Press for laying upon it excessive and prohibitive burdens which would restrict the circulation, impose a penalty on its right to choose the instruments for its exercise or to seek an alternative media;<sup>11</sup>

(c) to impose a specific tax upon the Press deliberately calculated to limit the circulation of information.<sup>133</sup>

When the constitutionality of an enactment specially directed against the Press is challenged, the Court has to test it by the standard of substantive and procedural reasonableness, as explained earlier. An enactment of this nature, the Punjab Special Powers (Press) Act, 1956, came up before the Supreme Court in Virendra v. State of Punjab, <sup>138</sup> and the Court annulled one of its provisions, while upholding another, on the following grounds:

A law which empowers the Government to prohibit, for a temporary period, the entry of literature of a *specified class*, likely to cause communal disharmony would<br>not be held to be unreasonable, if it complies with the procedural requirements of<br>natural justice. But it would be unreasonable if it e satisfied that such action was necessary for the maintenance of communal harmony or public order, inasmuch as it placed the whole matter at the subjective satisfaction of the State Government without even providing for a right of representation to the party affected.

Since the expiry of the Press (Objectionable Matter) Act, 1951, in 1956, there was no all-India Act for the control of the Press in India. But in 1976, Parliament enacted the Prevention of Publication of Objectionable Matter INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA **[CHAP. 8** 

Act, 1976, with more rigorous provisions, and in a permanent form. In April, 1977, the Janata Government repealed this Act. Subsequently, however, this position was further buttressed by inserting a new Article in the Constitution itself,-Art. 361A<sup>139</sup>-by the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978.

Censorship of the press, again, is not specially prohibited by any provision of the Constitution. Like other restrictions, Censorship. therefore, its constitutionality has to be judged by the test of 'reasonableness' within the meaning of Cl. (2).<sup>138</sup>

Soon after the commencement of the Constitution and prior to the insertion of the word 'reasonable' in Cl. (2), the question of validity of censorship came up before our Supreme Court, in the case of Brij Bhushan<br>v. State of Delhi.<sup>140</sup>

## The facts of this case were as follows:

Section 7(1)(c) of the East Punjab Safety Act, 1949, provided that "the Provincial Government . . . if satisfied that such action is necessary for preventing or combating any activity prejudicial to the *public safety* or the maintenance of *public order may*, by order in writing addressed to a printer, publisher, editor require that any matter relating to a particular subject or class of subjects shall before publication be submitted for scrutiny".

Similar provisions of the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1949, were challenged in the allied case of Ramesh Thappar v. State of Madras.

The majority of the Supreme Court had no difficulty in holding that the imposition of pre-censorship on a journal was an obvious restriction upon the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by clause (1)(a) of article 19, that 'public safety' or 'public order' was not covered by the expression 'security of the State', and the impugned law was not, therefore, saved by clause (2) as it then stood.

Shortly after these decisions,<sup>140</sup> Cl. (2) was amended by the Constitution (1st Amendment) Act, 1951, inserting 'public order' in Cl. (2). Hence, the ground relied upon by the majority in the cases of Ramesh Thappar<sup>140</sup> and Brij Bhushan<sup>140</sup> is no longer available. The word 'reasonable' was also inserted in Cl. (2) by the same amendment. The result of this twofold amendment is that if censorship is imposed in the interests of public order, it cannot at once be held to be unconstitutional as fetter upon the freedom of circulation but its 'reasonableness' has to be determined with reference to the circumstances of its imposition. In this sense, the introduction of the word 'reasonable' has not been an unmixed blessing. For, censorship of the press, in times of peace, is something unimaginable either in England or in the United States in modern times. But under our Constitution, as the Supreme Court decision in Virendra v. State of Punjab<sup>138</sup> suggests, even at a time of peace, censorship may be valid if it is subjected to reasonable safeguards, both from the substantive and procedural standpoints, but not otherwise. The provisions before the Court<sup>138</sup> were ss. 2 and 3 of the Punjab Special Powers (Press) Act, 1956, which were similar to that in s.  $7(1)(c)$  of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949 (which had been impugned in *Brij* Bhushan's case),<sup>140</sup> except that in the Act of the 1956 what was authorised was even more drastic than pre-censorship, viz.,-a total prohibition. The Court held that s. 2, which provided for a right of representation against the order of the authority and limited the power to a specified period and as to

# CHAP. 8 FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

publications of a specified class, was valid; but that s. 3, which had no such safeguards, constituted an unreasonable restriction.

It would, therefore, follow that a provision for pre-censorship for a limited period in emergent circumstances and subject to procedural safeguards, e.g., as in s. 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, is valid.<sup>141</sup> If, however, it is left to the absolute discretion<sup>138</sup> of the executive authority, it must be held to be unreasonable. The Supreme Court has, similarly, upheld the validity of a law sanctioning pre-censorship of motion pictures to protect the interests safeguarded by Art. 19(2), e.g., public order and morality.<sup>142</sup>

It should be noted that when a Proclamation of Emergency is made under Art. 352, Art. 19 itself remains suspended [Art. 358], so that precensorship may be imposed, without any restraint (see Chap. 25, post). Thus, immediately after the Proclamation of Emergency on the ground of internal disturbance<sup>143</sup> in June, 1975, a Censorship Order was issued (June 26, 1975), under Rule 48(1) of the Rules made under the Defence and Internal Security of India Act, 1971. It should be noted that on the defeat of Mrs. GANDHI at the election of 1977 the Proclamation of Internal Emergency<sup>143</sup> was revoked on the 21st, and the Press Censorship Order was revoked on the 22nd of March, 1977.

Article 19 would also be inapplicable in cases where Arts. 31A-31C are attracted. These exceptions to Fundamental Rights, which have been introduced by subsequent amendments, will be discussed at the end of this Chapter.

Article 20 guarantees protection in certain respects against conviction for offences, by prohibiting-Art. 20: Protection

in respect<br>conviction  $in$  $\alpha$ f (a) Retrospective criminal legislation, commonly for known as ex post facto legislation. Offences.

(c) Compulsion to give self-incriminating evidence.

A. The provision against ex post facto legislation **Prohibition** against ex post facto is contained in Cl. (1) of Art. 20 of our Constitution Legislation. which runs as follows-

"No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence."

This is a limitation upon the law-making power of the Legislatures in India. A law is said to be prospective when it affects acts done or omission made after the law comes into effect. The majority of laws are prospective in their operation. But sometimes the Legislature may give retrospective effect to a law, that is to say, to bring within the operation of the law, not only future acts and omissions but also acts or omissions committed even prior to the enactment of the law in question. Though ordinarily a Legislature can enact prospective as well as retrospective laws, according to the present clause a Legislature shall not be competent to make a *criminal law* retrospective so as to provide that a person may be convicted for an act which was not an

#### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA $[CHAP. 8]$

offence under the law in force at the time of commission of that act or to subject an accused to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. In other words, when the Legislature declares an act to be an offence or provides a penalty for an offence, it cannot make the law retrospective so as to prejudicially affect the persons who have committed such acts prior to the enactment of that law.<sup>144</sup> Enlarging a penal provision for prosecution would be violative of Art. 20(1).<sup>145</sup>

B. The prohibition against double jeopardy is contained in Cl. (2) of from Art. 20 which runs thus-Immunity

**Double** Prosecution Punishment.

"No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same and offence more than once.

The expression 'double jeopardy' is used in the American law but not in our Constitution. Nevertheless, Cl. (2) of Art. 20, in effect, lays down a similar principle. As has been laid down by the Supreme<br>Court in Venkataraman v. Union of India,<sup>146</sup> Art. 20(2) refers to judicial punishment and gives immunity to a person from being prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. In other words, if a person has been prosecuted and punished in a previous proceeding of an offence, he cannot be prosecuted and punished for the same offence again in a subsequent proceeding. If any law provides for such double punishment, such law would be void. The Article, however, does not give immunity from proceedings other than proceedings before a court of law or a judicial tribunal. Hence, a Government servant who has been punished for an offence in a court of law may yet be subjected to *departmental proceedings* for the same offence, or conversely.<sup>146</sup> If the accused was neither convicted nor acquitted of the charges against him in the first trial, his retrial would not amount to double jeopardy.<sup>147</sup>Prosecution and punishment under two sections of an Act, the offences under the two sections being distinct from each other, does not amount to double jeopardy.<sup>148</sup>

**Accused's Immunity** being from compelled to give<br>evidence against himself.

C. The immunity from self-incrimination is conferred by Cl. (3) of Art. 20 which says-

"No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself."

The scope of this immunity has, prima facie, been widened by our Supreme Court by interpreting the word 'witness' to comprise both oral and documentary evidence, so that no person can be compelled to furnish any kind of evidence which is reasonably likely to support a prosecution against him. Such evidence must, however, be in the nature of a communication. The prohibition is not attracted where any object or document is searched and seized from the possession of the accused.<sup>149</sup> For the same reason, the Clause does not bar the medical examination of the accused or the obtaining of thumb-impression or specimen signature from him.<sup>150</sup>

Secondly, the immunity does not extend to civil proceedings or other than criminal proceedings.<sup>151</sup> It has also been explained by the Supreme Court<sup>149</sup> that in order to claim the immunity from being compelled to make a self-incriminating statement, it must appear that a formal accusation has been made against the person at the time when he is asked to make the

"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law." Protection of life personal and liberty.

This Article reminds us of one of the famous clauses of the Magna Carta:

"No man shall be taken or imprisoned, disseized or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed save . . . by the law of the land."

It means that no member of the Executive shall be entitled to interfere with the liberty of a citizen unless he can support his action by some provision of law. In short, no man can be subjected to any physical coercion that does not admit of legal justification. When, therefore, the State or any of its agents deprives an individual of his personal liberty, such action can be justified only if there is a law to support such action and the procedures prescribed by such law have been "strictly and scrupulously"<sup>153</sup> observed.

Again, as under the English Constitution, personal freedom is secured by the Indian Constitution by the judicial writ of habeas corpus (see under 'Habeas Corpus', post) [Arts. 32 and 226] by means of which an arrested person may have himself brought before the Court and have the ground of his imprisonment examined, and regain his freedom if the Court finds that there is no legal justification for his imprisonment. The Court will also set the prisoner free where there is a law authorising the deprivation of liberty of a person but there has been no strict compliance with the conditions imposed by the law. The Supreme Court has more than once observed that "those who feel called upon to deprive other persons of their personal liberty in the discharge of what they conceive to be their duty, must strictly and scrupulously observe the forms and rules of the law".153

But in no country can there be any absolute freedom of the individual. The principle underlying the English Constitution is that it is the people's representatives, assembled in Parliament, who shall determine how far the rights of the individuals should go and how far they should be curtailed in the collective interests or for the security of the State itself, according to exigencies of the time. This was the theory adopted by the Constitution of India in saying that life and personal liberty are subject to "the procedure established by law". The Supreme Court has, however infused judicial review by holding that 'procedure' inherently meant a fair procedure, so that INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 8]

Art. 21 has been turned into a safeguard against arbitrary legislation. The history of this change in view is as follows:

I. Until the 1978-decision in Maneka's case,<sup>24</sup> the view which prevailed in our Supreme Court was that there was no guarantee The Gopalan view.

in our Constitution against arbitrary legislation encroaching upon personal liberty. Hence, if a competent Legislature makes a law providing that a person may be deprived of his liberty in certain circumstances and in a certain manner, the validity of the law could not be challenged in a court of law on the ground that the law is unreasonable, unfair or unjust.<sup>154</sup> Under the 'Due Process' Clause of the American Constitution (5th and 14th Amendments), the Court has assumed the power of declaring unconstitutional any law which deprives a person of his liberty otherwise than in accordance with the Court's notions of 'due process', that is, reasonableness and fairness. In England, this is not possible inasmuch as Courts have no power to invalidate a law made by Parliament. In the result, personal liberty is, in England, "a liberty confined and controlled by law". It exists only so far as it is not taken away or limited by laws made by the representatives of the people. In A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, 154 the majority of our Supreme Court propounded the view that by adopting the expression 'procedure established by law', Art. 21 of our Constitution had embodied the English concept of personal liberty in preference to that of American 'Due Process', even though, according to the minority,<sup>154</sup> the result of such interpretation was to throw "the most important fundamental right to life and personal liberty" "at the mercy of legislative majorities." The result, according to the majority, is due to the difference in the basic approach, namely, that-

"Although our Constitution has imposed some limitations on the legislative authorities yet subject to and outside such limitations our Constitution has left our Parliament and the State legislatures supreme in their respective fields. In the main ... our Constitution has *preferred the supremacy of the legislature to that of the judiciary*.<sup>154</sup>

It was also held<sup>154-155</sup> that there is no safeguard for personal liberty under our Constitution besides Art. 21, such as natural law or common law. In the result, when personal liberty is taken away by a competent legislation, the person affected can have no remedy.<sup>155</sup>

II. It is a striking feature of the development of constitutional law of Maneka v. Union of India that after a long struggle, which may be said to have started tangibly since 1971, the minority view in Gopalan's case<sup>154</sup> has come to triumph in the 7-Judge

decision in Maneka's case,<sup>24</sup> which we have already noted. This case<sup>24</sup> has categorically laid down the following propositions, overturning the majority in Gopalan : 154

(a) Arts. 19 and 21 are not water-tight compartments. On the other hand, the expression of 'personal liberty' in Art. 21 is of the widest amplitude, covering a variety of rights of which some have been included in Art. 19 and given *additional* protection. Hence, there may be some overlapping between Arts. 19 and 21.

## FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES CHAP. 8]

(b) In the result, a law coming under Art. 21 must also satisfy the requirements of Art. 19. In other words, a law made by the State which seeks to deprive a person of his personal liberty must prescribe a *procedure* for such deprivation which must not be arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable.

(c) Once the test of reasonableness is imported to determine the validity of a law depriving a person of his liberty, it follows that such law shall be invalid if it violates the principles of natural justice, e.g., if it provides for the impounding of a passport without giving the person affected an opportunity to be heard or to make a representation against the order proposed.<sup>24</sup>

From Gopalan<sup>154</sup> to Maneka,<sup>24</sup> thus, the judicial exploration has completed its trek from the North to the South Pole. The decision in Maneka's case<sup>24</sup> is being followed by the Supreme Court in subsequent cases.

The Supreme Court has held that the right to life as enshrined in Art. 21 means something more than survival or animal existence and would Dinclude the right to live with human dignity. If would include right to minimum subsistence allowance during suspension and all those aspects which go to make a man's life meaningful, complete and worthliving.

Adopting a liberal interpretation the Supreme Court<sup>156</sup> has read several rights in Art. 21 to make 'life' more meaningful and worthliving. They may be enumerated as under :

- 1. Right not be subjected to bonded labour and to be rehabilitated after release.
- 2. Right to livelihood.
- 3. Right to decent environment.
- 4. Right to appropriate life insurance policy.
- 5. Right to good health.
- 6. Right to food, water, education (not professional or special), medical care and shelter.

19. Right to doctor's assistance.

20. Right to social justice and economic empowerment.

21. Right to freedom from noise pollution.

22. Right to reputation.

23. Right to family pension (release).

24. Right of decent burial or cremation.

25. Right to information.

26. Right to hearing.

27. Right of appeal from judgment of conviction.

Apart from the foregoing judicial salvage, let us now advert to the safeguards which the Constitution itself has provided in Art. 22 against arbitrary arrest and detention. Hence, in a case coming under Art. 22, the requirements of both Arts. 21 and 22 must be complied with.<sup>119</sup>

Protection against<br>Arbitrary Arrest and Detention.

B. The procedural safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention, provided for in Cls. (1) and (2) of Art. 22, are-(a) No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest.

Albanya ist a blue fed of

(b) No such person shall be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.

c) Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate.

The above safeguards are not, however, available to-(a) an enemy alien; (b) a person arrested or detained under a law providing for preventive detention.

The Constitution itself authorises the Legislature to make laws providing for-Art. 22: Preventive Detention.

"Preventive detention" for reasons connected with<br>the security of a State, the maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community, or for reasons connected with Defence, Foreign Affairs or the Security of India [7th Sch. List I, Entry 9; List III, Entry 3].

So, it would be competent to the Legislature to enact that a person should be detained or imprisoned without trial for any of the above reasons and against such laws, the individual shall have no right of personal liberty. The Constitution, however, imposes certain safeguards against abuse of the above power  $[Art. 22(4)-(7)]$ . It is these safeguards which constitute fundamental rights against arbitrary detention and it is because of these safeguards that 'preventive detention' has found a place in the Part of 'Fundamental Rights' in our Constitution. The relevant provisions of Art. 22 read as follows:
### When a person has been arrested under a law of preventive detention-

(i) The Government is entitled to detain such person in custody only for three months. If it seeks to detain the arrested person for more than 3 months, it must obtain a report from an Advisory Board,-who will examine the papers submitted by the Government and by the accused,-as to whether the detention is justified.

(ii) The person so detained shall, as soon as may be, be informed of the grounds of his detention excepting facts which the detaining authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose.

(iii) The person detained must have the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order of detention.<sup>154</sup>

A law which violates any of the conditions imposed by Art. 22, as stated above, is liable to be declared invalid and an order of detention which violates any of these conditions will, similarly, be invalidated by the Court, and the detenu shall forthwith be set free.<sup>157</sup>

Parliament has the power to prescribe, by law, the maximum period for which a person may be detained under a law of preventive detention.

Preventive detention means detention of a person without trial. It is so called in order to distinguish it from punitive detention. Meaning of Pre-<br>ventive Detention. The object of punitive detention is to *punish* a person for what he has done and after he is tried in the courts

for the illegal act committed by him. The object of preventive detention, on the other hand, is to *prevent him from doing* something and the detention in this case takes place on the apprehension that he is going to do something wrong which comes within any of the grounds specified by the Constitution, viz., acts prejudicial to the security of the State, public order, maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community; defence; foreign affairs or security of India. In fact, preventive detention is resorted to in such circumstances that the evidence in possession of the authority is not you sufficient to make a charge or to secure the conviction of the detenu by legal proofs but may still be sufficient to justify his detention on the suspicion that he would commit a wrongful act unless he is detained.

Preventive detention is something unknown in the United States of America or the United Kingdom, in times of peace. The adoption (in India) on a permanent footing, of the power of the Executive to arrest persons on suspicion, which is tolerated in other countries only in emergencies, cannot, on principle, be justified by any lover of liberty. But no proper assessment of this provision of our Constitution is possible without taking note of the following circumstances:

Firstly, detention without trial was not a new idea introduced by the

History of Preven-<br>tive Detention of India.

makers of our Constitution, for the first time. It was in existence since the early days of British India, under the notorious Bengal Regulation III of 1818 (the Bengal State Prisoners Regulation) and similar enact-

ments in Madras and Bombay which laid no fetters upon the powers of the Government to detain a person on suspicion. Then came Rule 26 of the

### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA ICHAP<sub>.</sub>8

٠

Rules framed under the Defence of India Act, 1939, which authorised the Government to detain a person whenever it was "satisfied with respect to that particular person that such detention was necessary to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial" to the defence and safety of the country and the like.<sup>158</sup> This was, of course, a wartime measure modelled on similar legislation in England, during World War II, the validity of which had been upheld by the House of Lords.<sup>159</sup> But even after the cessation of the War, preventive detention was continued in India as an instrument to suppress apprehended breach of public order, public safety and the like by the Provincial Maintenance of Public Order Acts, under which there was a spate of litigation. The framers of our Constitution simply made it possible for such legislation to be continued under the Constitution, subject to certain safeguards laid down therein, because they painfully visualised that the circumstances which had necessitated such abnormal legislation in the past had not disappeared at the birth of India's Independence. It is common knowledge that the Republic had its birth amidst anti-social and subversive forces and the ravages of communal madness involving colossal loss of lives and property. In order to save the infant Republic from the inroads of any such subversive elements, therefore, this power had to be conferred upon the State. But the framers of the Constitution improved upon the existing law by subjecting the power of preventive detention to certain constitutional safeguards upon the violation of which the individual could have a right to approach the Supreme Court or the High Courts because the safeguards are fundamental rights, for the enforcement of which the constitutional remedies would lie. There have been a number of cases in which the Courts have nullified orders of preventive detention, in proceedings for habeas corpus.

Secondly, the above provisions of the Constitution are not self-executory but require a law to be made by the Legislature, conforming to the conditions laid down in the Article, and preventive detention can subsist only so long as the Legislature permits. The Preventive Detention Act, 1950 was, thus, passed by the Indian Parliament which constituted the law of preventive detention in India. It was a temporary Act, originally passed for one year only. Several times since then the term of the Act was extended until it expired at the end of 1969. The revival of anarchist forces obliged Parliament to enact a new Act, named the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (popularly known as MISA) in 1971, having provisions broadly similar to those of the Preventive Detention Act of 1950. In 1974, Parliament passed the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling<br>Activities Act, 1974 (commonly referred to as the COFEPOSA), as an<br>economic adjunct of the MISA. While the MISA was, in general, aimed at subversive activities, the COFEPOSA is aimed at anti-social activities like smuggling, racketing in foreign exchange and the like. MISA was repealed in 1978, but COFEPOSA still remains. Further power of preventive detention, has been conferred on the Central and State Governments to safeguard defence and security of the country and to maintain public order and essential supplies and services by enacting the National Security Act, 1980,<sup>160</sup> and the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980.<sup>161</sup> With the increase in terrorist activities the government had to pass in 1985 the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1985 (commonly called TADA). This has widely

been used to curb terrorism. However, TADA was repealed in 1995. For the same purposes, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (commonly called POTA) was enacted on March 28, 2002 but that too was repealed on October 23, 2004.

It may be mentioned that the number of detenus, during the Emergency of 1975-76, had soared up to 1,75,000. On the eve of coming to power, the Janata Party promised to abolish detention without trial. After coming to power, the Janata Government came to realise the reality of the problem. Eventually, in April, 1978, the MISA was repealed by Parliament. But the Government refused to repeal the COFEPOSA because while the former related to political detention, the latter was aimed at social offences which required extra power to check when inflation, blackmarketing, smuggling and the like were rampant.

The provisions in Cls. (2)-(7) of Art. 22 could not be altogether omitted, so long as preventive detention was authorised by COFEPOSA. The Janata Government, therefore, sought to alleviate the rigours of the procedure for<br>preventive detention, by effecting changes in Cls. (4) and (7), by enacting the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978. But the relevant provision of this Amendment Act could not be brought into effect immediately since some changes in the machinery of the Advisory Boards had to be made. Hence, the Amendment Act of 1978 empowered the Central Government to bring into force these provisions by issuing notifications. Paradoxically, however, before any such notification could be issued, the Janata Government had its fall and Mrs. Gandhi returned to power in January, 1980. The Government has not issued any such notification notwithstanding adverse comments by the Supreme Court in view of the inordinate delay.<sup>160</sup> In the result, the original Clauses relating to preventive detention in Art. 22 subsist till today and the relevant provisions of the Amendment Act of 1978, solemnly passed by Parliament, remain a dead-letter.

Some States, e.g., Jammu and Kashmir and Madhya Pradesh have Legislative power enacted State laws, authorising preventive detention<sup>162</sup><br>to enact Preven-which recall the *old* Preventive Detention Act of 1950.<br>tive Detention Act. It should be pointed out in this context that the legislative power to enact law of preventive detention

is divided by the Constitution between the Union and the States. The Union has exclusive power [Entry 9 of List I, 7th Sch.] only when such law is required for reasons connected with Defence, Foreign Affairs or the Security of India. A State has power, concurrently with the Union, to provide for preventive detention for reasons connected with security of the State, maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community [Entry 3 of List III]. A State has therefore a say in the matter of abolishing preventive detention on these grounds because it is a responsibility of the State to maintain public order [Entry 1 of List II], production, supply and distribution of goods [Entry 27 of List II].

So long as the concurrent power of the States to legislate for preventive detention with respect to the aforesaid grounds remains and any of them feels the need for retaining or making State laws for preventive detention, it is practically difficult for the Union Government to impose its will on such INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA  $[CHAP. 8]$ 

States. Till then, the existence of Art. 22 on the Constitution will be beneficial, rather than prejudicial, to the cause of liberty, because the validity of such State laws can be challenged on the ground of contravention of the safeguards laid down in Art. 22.154

In these circumstances, Art. 22 continues to be on the Constitution as a necessary evil.

As an adjunct to the guarantee of personal Art. 23: Right liberty and the prohibition against discrimination, our against Exploitation. Constitution lays down certain provisions to prevent exploitation of the weaker sections of the society by

unscrupulous individuals or even by the State.

Article 23 says-

**Prohibition** of **Traffic** in Human **Beings and Forced** Labour.

"(1) Traffic in human beings and begar and other similar forms of forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law.

(2) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from and rorced<br>imposing compulsory service for public purposes, and in<br>discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste or class or any of them."

Slavery in its ancient form may not so much be a problem in every State today but its newer forms which are labelled in the Indian Constitution under the general term "exploitation" are no less a serious challenge to human freedom and civilisation. It is in this view that our Constitution, instead of using the word 'slavery' uses the more comprehensive expression 'traffic in human beings' which includes a prohibition not only of slavery but also of traffic in women or children or the crippled, for immoral or other purposes.<sup>163</sup> Our Constitution also prohibits forced labour of any form which is similar to begar, an indigenous system under which landlords sometimes used to compel their tenants to render free service.<sup>163-164</sup> What is prohibited by the clause is therefore the act of compelling a person to render gratuitous service where he was lawfully entitled either not to work or to receive remuneration for it. The clause therefore does not prohibit forced labour as punishment for a criminal offence. Nor would it prevent the State from imposing compulsory recruitment or conscription for public purposes, such as military or even social service.

Art. 23 has an element of force.<sup>165</sup>

Special provision for the protection of children is made in Art. 24 which says-

Art. 24: Prohibition "No child below the age of fourteen years, shall be employed of Employment of to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other Children in Fac-hazardous employment." tories, etc.

It is to be noted that the prohibition imposed by this Article is absolute and does not admit of any exception for the employment of a child in a factory or mine or in any other 'hazardous employment', e.g., in a railway or a port. The Supreme Court directed that children should not be employed in hazardous jobs in factories and positive steps should be taken for the welfare of such children as well as improving<br>the quality of their life<sup>166</sup> and the employers of children below 14 years must

The |

attitude of impartiality towards all religions is secured by the Constitution by several provisions [Arts. 25-28]:

Firstly, there shall be no "State religion" in India. The State will neither establish a religion of its own nor confer any special patronage upon any particular religion. It follows from this that-

(a) the State will not compel any citizen to pay any taxes for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious institution  $[Art. 27]$ ;

(b) no religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly provided by State funds;

(c) even though religious instruction be imparted in educational institutions recognised by or receiving aid from the State, no person attending such institution shall be compelled to receive that religious instruction without the consent of himself or of his guardian (in case the pupil be a minor). In short, while religious instruction is totally banned in State-owned educational institutions, in other denominational institutions it is not totally prohibited but it must not be imposed upon people of other religions without their consent [Art. 28].

Secondly, every person is guaranteed the freedom of conscience and the freedom to profess, practise and porpagate his own religion, subject only-

(a) to restrictions imposed by the State in the interests of public order, morality and health (so that the freedom of religion may not be abused to commit crimes or anti-social acts, e.g., to commit the practice of infanticide, and the like);

(b) to regulations or restrictions made by the State relating to any economic, financial, political or other *secular* activity which may be associated with religious practice, but do not really appertain to the freedom of conscience;

(c) to measures for social reform and for throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a *public* character to all classes and sections of Hindus.

Subject to the above limitations, a person in India shall have the right not only to entertain any religious belief but also to practise the observances dictated by such belief, and to preach his views to others [Art. 25].

INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 8]

Thirdly, not only is there the freedom of the individual to profess, practise and propagate his religion, there is also the right guaranteed to every religious group or denomination-

(a) to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes;

(b) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion;

(c) to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and

(d) to administer such property in accordance with law  $[Art. 26]$ .

To those who have any idea as to what part religion plays in the entire being of the common man in India, the bold pronouncements in the above Articles must appear to be astoundingly progressive, and more so, if we consider that while the other half of the truncated territory, consisting of a large mass of Hindu minority, has adopted Islam as the State religion in her Constitution, India stands firm, regardless of her environments. It is to be noted that this guarantee is available not only to the citizens of India but to all persons, including aliens.<sup>168</sup>

The ambit of the freedom of religion guaranteed by Arts. 25-26 has been widened by the judicial interpretation that what is guaranteed by Arts. 25 and 26 is the right of the *individual* to practise and propagate not only matters of faith or belief but also all those rituals and observances which are regarded as integral parts of a religion by the followers of its doctrines.<sup>168</sup> Of course, religion is a matter of faith but it is not necessarily theistic and there are well-known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainism which do not believe in God. On the other hand, though a religion undoubtedly has its basis in a system of beliefs or doctrines which are regarded by those who profess that religion as conducive to their spiritual well-being, it would not be correct to say that religion is nothing else but a doctrine of belief.<sup>168</sup> Similarly, each religious denomination or organisation enjoys complete autonomy in the matter of deciding as to what rites and ceremonies are *essential* according to the tenets of the religion they hold.<sup>169</sup> Regulation by the State, again, cannot interfere with things which are essentially religious.<sup>170</sup> But the Court has the right to determine whether a particular rite or observance is regarded as essential by the tenets of a particular religion,<sup>171</sup> and to interfere if a particular practice offends against public health or morality,<sup>170</sup> or, not being an essentially religious practice, contravenes any law of social, economic or political regulation.<sup>170</sup>

It should be pointed out in this context that the word 'secular' is a dubious word, capable of diverse meanings and one of its dictionary meanings is 'concerned with the affairs of the world' as opposed to religious affairs. This has not only caused confusion amongst teachers of Political Science and Law in India but has also been taken advantage of by interested parties. This state of confusion has been set at rest by authoritative pronouncements made by the Supreme Court, in a nine-Judge decision, as follows:<sup>172</sup>

## CHAP. 8 FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

(a) Secularism, in India, does not mean that the State should be hostile to religion but that it should be neutral as between the different religions.<sup>172</sup>

(b) Every individual has the freedom to profess and practise his own religion, and it cannot be contended that "if a person is a devout Hindu or a devout Muslim, he ceases to be secular".<sup>172</sup>

(c) The use of the vague word 'secular' in the Preamble would not override the enacted provisions in Arts. 25-30 or Art. 351, so that the preference of Sanskrit in the academic syllabus as an elective<sup>173-174</sup> subject, while not conceding this status to Arabic or Persian or the like, would not militate against the basic tenets of secularism (para 20).<sup>173</sup>

(d) The neutrality of the state would be violated if religion is used for political purposes and advocated by the political parties for their political ends. An appeal to the electorate on grounds of religion offends secular democracy (para 128).<sup>172</sup> Politics and religion cannot be mixed (para 131).<sup>172</sup> If a State Government does this, it will be a fit case for application of Art. 356 of the Constitution against it [Para 365(10)].<sup>172</sup>

(e) It is in this sense that secularism is to be regarded as a basic feature of the Constitution [Paras 124, 231, 365(10)].<sup>172</sup>

It is amazing that some Christian leaders assert that the word and propagate' in Art. 25(1) gives them a fundamental 'Propagation' Conversion. right to convert people of other Faiths into Christianity, by any means. This assertion, followed by agita-

tion, is particularly amazing because it seeks to undermine the decision of the Supreme Court in *Stainislaus's* case<sup>175</sup> in January, 1977, which had been brought by a Christian Father, who sought to invalidate a Madhya Pradesh Act, because it made it a penal offence to convert or to attempt to convert a person by means of 'force, fraud or allurement'. Orissa had earlier passed a similar Act (which used the word 'inducement' in place of allurement') and the constitutionality of that Act had been challenged by several members of the Christian community, including a Christian Society, a Professor of Geology and several priests. Both the Acts were taken up together by the Supreme Court<sup>175</sup> and the contentions of the Christian community were rejected in toto, by the Supreme Court, laying down the following propositions of law which are, under the Constitution, binding upon all Courts in India:

(i) The right to 'propagate', in Art. 25(1), gives to each member of every religion the right to spread or disseminate the tenets of his religion (say, by advocacy or preaching), but it would not include the right to convert another, because each man has the same freedom of 'conscience' guaranteed by that very provision  $[Art. 25(1)]$ , on which the Christians relied.

(ii) The equal freedom of conscience, belonging to each man, under Art. 25(1), means that he has the freedom to choose and hold any faith of his choice and not to be converted into another religion by means of force, fraud, inducement or allurement. He can, of course, voluntarily adopt another

INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 8

religion, but 'force, fraud, inducement or allurement' takes away the free consent from the would-be convert.

(iii) Even assuming that a particular religion had the right to propagate its tenets by any means, including conversion,—the State has the right and duty to intervene if such activity of conversion offended against 'public order, morality or health', because the guarantee of freedom of religion in Art. 25(1) is subject to the limitations of 'public order, morality, or health' as follows:

"25. (1) Subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion."

(iv) If any such right to convert be conceded, such right would belong to every religion, so that there would inevitably be a breach of the public peace if every religious community carried on a campaign to convert people belonging to other faiths, by the use of force, fraud, inducement or allurement. The State was, therefore, constitutionally authorised, nay, enjoinedto maintain public order by prohibiting and penalising conversion (including attempt to convert) if force, fraud, inducement or allurement was used by the person or persons advocating conversion in any particular case. This is exactly what had been done by the M.P. and Orissa Acts.

The Supreme Court, therefore, upheld<sup>175</sup> the constitutional validity of both the M.P. and Orissa Acts, after rejecting every plea raised on behalf of the Christian parties. After this pronouncement of the Supreme Court, the Arunachal Pradesh Legislature passed a Bill, modelled exactly on the M.P. and Orissa Acts, which had been held to be valid by the Supreme Court and submitted it to the President for his assent; a private member of Parliament (Shri O.P. TYAGI) presented before the Lok Sabha a similar Bill, which, if passed by Parliament, would be applicable to all the States of India. The Christian community at once started agitations and demonstrations against these two Bills, with threats against severer resistance if these measures were passed. They politicised the issue, with the slogan that it was a campaign against the Christian religion in particular.<sup>176</sup> This contention involves *suppressio veri* (suppression of truth) on the following points:

(i) Neither of the disputed Bills was levelled against the Christian religion as such but would have operated against any religious community (including the Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, etc.) which resorted to any of these unlawful means-force, fraud, inducement or allurement, in order to convert a member of another Faith to its own fold.

(ii) That all the legal points now raised against these two pending Bills were taken by the Christian parties to the Madhya Pradesh and Orissa Acts case but were definitely rejected by the Supreme Court.

(iii) Those who rely on the International Charters in support of their International cove- freedom to convert have not mentioned Art. 18(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political nant. Rights, 1966, which says-

"No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.'

This freedom of every man to adopt a religion of his choice is guaranteed by Cl. (1) of Art. 18. The two clauses, read together, mean that every individual shall have the freedom to choose his own religion or belief in worship and this freedom shall not be impaired by the use of coercion by any individual attempting to induce him to adopt another religion. So far as the disputed Indian Bills ban the use of force as a means of conversion, it is perfectly in line with this International Charter. When fraud is used, the freedom of choice of the individual sought to be converted is similarly impaired. The only dispute which may possibly be raised by the Indian Christians is as to the use of inducement or allurement. But such means, too, impair the freedom of choice of an individual and his resultant choice or volition cannot be said to be *free*, within the meaning of Art.  $18(1)$  of the International Covenant, referred to. The validity of use of these two words in an Indian Bill would rest not on the wording of the International Covenant which is the resultant of various international factors, but on the interpretation of the words 'public order and morality' in Art. 25(1) of our Constitution, which constitutes the supreme law of this land.

(iv) If the agitators were dissatisfied with the Supreme Court's interpretation of Art. 25(1), they were free to challenge the constitutionality of the provisions of the disputed Bills after they were passed<sup>176</sup> and to persuade the Judges of the Supreme Court to revise their views as expressed in the *Stainislaus* case;<sup>136</sup> but there was not the least justification to denounce the Bills as a crusade against the Christians in particular, when they were nothing but a codification of the principles laid down by the highest tribunal of the land and on the model of the State statutes which had been approved by that tribunal in the Stainislaus case.<sup>175</sup>

Apart from the foregoing guarantee of freedom of conscience and religion, there are certain general provisions which are aimed at ensuring the effectiveness of the above guarantee by prohibiting any discrimination by the State on the ground of religion alone:

The State shall not discriminate against a citizen, in any matter  $[Art. 15(1)]$ , and, in particular, in the matter of employment  $[Art. 16(2)]$ , only upon the ground of religion.

(ii) Similar discrimination is banned as regards access to or use of public places [Art. 15(2)]; admission into any educational institution maintained or aided by the State  $[Art. 29(2)]$ , the right to vote  $[Art. 325]$ .

(iii) Where a religious community is in the minority, the Constitution goes further to enable it to preserve its culture and religious interests by providing that-

(a) The State shall not impose upon it any cultu-Art. 29. re other than the community's own culture  $[Art.29(1)];$ 

(b) Such community shall have the right to establish and administer

educational institutions of its choice and the State shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discri-

minate against such an educational institution maintained by a minority
INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP<sub>.</sub>8]

community on the ground that it is under the management of a religious community [Art. 30]. Full compensation has to be paid if the State seeks to acquire the property of a minority educational institution  $[Art. 30(1A)].$ 

The expression "minority" has been used in two senses-one based on religion and the other on the basis of language. Since reorganisation of the States in India has been on linguistic lines, therefore, for the purpose of determining the minority, the unit will be the State and not the whole of India. Hence, minorities have to be considered Statewise. It is a relative term and is referred to, to represent the linguistic or religious sections or groups forming less than 50% of the total population of the State.<sup>177</sup>

The sum-total of the above provisions make our State more secular than even the United States of America. The secular nature of our Constitution has been further highlighted by inserting this word in the Preamble, by the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976.<sup>178</sup> A word of caution should. however, be uttered in this context. What is meant by 'secularism' or the safeguards of the minority, are exhaustively enumerated in Arts. 25-30 and allied provisions (as to minority rights, see, further, under Chap. 29, post). If a minority community presses for any extra favours outside these specific provisions in the name of 'secularism' or the Party in power yields them for political reasons, it might be re-introducing those vices of communalism from which India suffered so much during the later British regime and which the fathers of the Constitution eliminated from the Constitution of free India, e.g., communal representation in the Legislatures<sup>179</sup> or communal reservation in public employment. For instance, if Government seeks to justify an appointment to a public office, high or low, not on the ground of merit, but on the ground that the appointee belongs to a religious minority, such discrimination would violate the fundamental right of any other community under Art. 16(2), not to be "discriminated against" on the ground of 'religion' or the like. Instead of safeguarding the rights of a minority community, it would deny the rights of the majority and other minority communities which are guaranteed by the Constitution itself. Neither secularism nor minority rights can, therefore, be allowed to be an argument for *preference* of the minority or to undermine the national unity and strength, for which the confidence of the majority is no less necessary. But a minority educational institution has the power to reserve only upto 50% seats for students belonging to its own community.<sup>180</sup>

An institution retains its minority character as long as it continues to achieve two objectives, viz. (i) to enable such minority to conserve its religion and language, and (ii) to give a thorough, good, general education to children belonging to such minority.<sup>181</sup>

The right to establish and administer would include the right to have choice of medium of instruction.<sup>182</sup> The Supreme Court<sup>183</sup> has summarised general principles relating to establishment and administration of educational institutions by minorities thus :

(i) The right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice comprises the following rights :

- (a) to choose its governing body in whom the founders of the institution have faith and confidence to conduct and manage the affairs of the institution;
- (b) to appoint teaching staff (teachers/lecturers and Headmasters/ Principals) as also non-teaching staff, and to take action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any of its employees;
- $(c)$  to admit eligible students of their choice and to set up a reasonable fee structure;
- $(d)$  to use its properties and assets for the benefit of the institution.
- (ii) The right conferred on minorities under Article 30 is only to ensure equality with the majority and not intended to place the minorities in a more advantageous position vis-a-vis the majority. There is no reverse discrimination in favour of minorities. The general laws of the land relating to national interest, national security, social welfare, public order, morality, health, sanitation, taxation, etc. applicable to all, will equally apply to minority institutions also.
- *(iii)* The right to establish and administer educational institutions is not absolute. Nor does it include the right to maladminister. There can be regulatory measures for ensuring educational character and standards and maintaining academic excellence. There can be checks on administration as are necessary to ensure that the administration is efficient and sound, so as to serve the academic needs of the institution. Regulations made by the State concerning generally the welfare of students and teachers, regulations laying down eligibility criteria and qualifications for appointment, as also conditions of service of employees (both teaching and nonteaching), regulations to prevent exploitation or oppression of employees, and regulations prescribing syllabus and curriculum of study fall under this category. Such regulations do not in any manner interfere with the right under Article 30(1).
- Subject to the eligibility conditions/qualifications prescribed by the  $(iv)$ State being met, the unaided minority educational institutions will have the freedom to appoint teachers/lecturers by adopting any rational procedure of selection.

However, the right of the minorities is not absolute and is subject to regulations.<sup>184</sup> Reasonable regulations can be imposed for protecting the larger interest of the State and the nation. While imposing the regulations, the State shall be cautious not to destroy the minority character of the institution.<sup>185</sup>

The Preamble to our Constitution aims at securing the 'unity and integrity of the nation'. Religious and cultural safeguards have been guaranteed by the Constitution to minority communities in order to ensure them 'justice, freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship'. But if any minority community goes on clamouring for more than what the framers of the Constitution offered to them, it would simply perpetuate the insular objectives of these communities and India would never grow up into a

**INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA**  $[CHAP. 8]$ 

Nation, inspired with the ideal of 'unity and integrity of the Nation'. To revert to the ante-independence vortex of communalism and separatism would imperil the very foundation of Independence. On the other hand, secularism which means neutrality of the State towards all religions will itself be violated if the Government suppresses the religious or other legal rights of the majority community to appease the demands of an aggressive minority.

A history of the right to property under the Constitution of India.

The Constitution of 1949 had a three-fold provision for safeguarding the right of private property. It not only guaranteed the right of private ownership but also the right to enjoy and dispose of property free from restrictions other than reasonable restrictions.

Firstly, it guaranteed to every citizen the right to acquire any property by any lawful means such as inheritance, personal earning or otherwise, to

I. The Constitution of 1949.

hold it as his own and to dispose it freely, limited only by (a) reasonable restrictions to serve the exigencies of public welfare, and (b) any other reasonable restric-

tions that may be imposed by the State to protect the interests of any Scheduled Tribe  $[Art. 19(1)(f)].$ 

The restrictions must, of course, be 'reasonable', from the substantive as well as the procedural standpoints. Thus-

(a) The restriction must not be in excess of the requirement of the interest of the general public for which the restriction is sought to be imposed.<sup>186</sup>

(b) A restriction would be procedurally unreasonable if, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, it is imposed without notice or without hearing or without assigning any reason, on the subjective satisfaction of an administrative authority.<sup>187</sup>

Secondly, the Constitution guaranteed that no person shall be deprived of his property save by the authority of law  $[Art. 31(1)].$  This implied that, short of the consent of the owner, a man's property can be taken only by the consent of the nation as embodied in the laws passed according to the Constitution. Any property which is seized by the Police or the Government<sup>188</sup> without proper legal authority will be released at the intervention of the Courts. As against its own subjects, a sovereign cannot exercise an 'Act of State', and the private property of a subject cannot be taken away by an *executive* order,<sup>189</sup> as distinguished from an order made in exercise of power conferred by a statute.<sup>189</sup>

This clause was intended to be a protection against executive, but not against legislative, appropriation of property. The Supreme Court, however, held that the law which seeks to deprive a person of his property must be a valid law, which means a law enacted by a competent Legislature and not inconsistent with any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.<sup>190</sup>

Thirdly, the Constitution enjoined that if the State wants to acquire the private property of an individual or to requisition (that is, to take over its possession for a temporary period) it, it could do so only on two conditions-

(a) that the acquisition or requisitioning is for a *public purpose*;

(b) that when such a law is passed, it must provide for payment of an amount to the owner,-either by fixing the amount or by specifying the principle upon which it is to be determined and given  $[Art. 31(2)]$ 

The provisions of the Constitution as to the obligation to pay compensation for acquisition of property for public purposes,

sauon for acquisition of property for public purposes,<br>the 42nd Act, 1976. amendments of the Course thanges as a result of amendments of the Constitution by the First, the Fourth, the Seventeenth, the Twenty-fifth and the Forty-second Amendment<br>Acts.<sup>191</sup> The net result of these amendments is as follows—

A. Though the Legislature was under a constitutional obligation to pay compensation, the *adequacy* of the compensation shall not be liable to be questioned in a court of law. In other words, when a law provided for the acquisition of person's property for a public purpose, he would not be entitled to challenge the validity of that law in a court of law on the ground that the Legislature had not provided for payment of the full value of his property. This (Fourth) amendment (1955) in Art. 31(2) was necessitated by the fact that even the word 'compensation' simpliciter was interpreted by the Supreme Court<sup>192</sup> as implying 'full compensation', that is, the market value of the property at the date of the acquisition. The Government thought that it was not practicable to implement its programme of national planning and development if the full market value was to be paid from the inadequate resources of the infant Republic for every inch of the property which was to be nationalised. But even after the foregoing amendment, the Supreme Court continued to hold that the very word 'compensation' implied full monetary equivalent of the property taken away from the owner, that is, its market value at the date of the acquisition.<sup>193</sup>

By the 25th Amendment of 1971, therefore, the word 'compensation' in

The 25th Amendment.

Cl. (2) of Art. 31 was substituted by the word 'amount'. But, again, the majority of the Supreme Court reserved an area for judicial intervention, in the Full

Bench case of Keshavananda v. State of Kerala, 194 by holding that the amount which was fixed by the Legislature could not be arbitrary or illusory, but must be determined by a principle which is relevant to the acquisition of property. [The Indira Government reacted by putting specified laws of acquisition beyond the pale of Art. 31 altogether, by engrafting the exceptions in Arts. 31A-31D,<sup>191</sup> which will be mentioned presently.]

B. By a number of successive amendments, certain exceptions to Art. 31(2) were introduced, in Arts. 31A-31D,<sup>191</sup> to exclude the obligation to pay any amount as compensation in the case of laws providing for acquisition by the State or nationalisation, if such laws relate to matters specified in these exceptional provisions. These exceptions to the obligations under Art. 31 may now be examined in particular:

INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA  $[CHAP.8]$ 

(a) Art. 31A relates to a law for the acquisition by the State of any 'estate' or other intermediate interest in *land*. The object of taking out the acquisition of intermediate interests in land from the obligation to pay compensation was to make it possible for the Government to effect agrarian reform which was so urgently needed to protect the interests of the tenants as well as to improve the agricultural wealth of the country.

In order to facilitate agrarian reform as well as social control of the means of production, it has been provided in Art. 31A that not only a law providing for the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights, but also certain other laws, such as a law providing for the taking over of the management of any property by the State for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property, shall be constitutionally valid even though it takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Arts. 14 and 19.

(b) While Art. 31A excepts certain *classes* of laws, Art. 31B, read with the 9th Schedule, gives a blanket cover to particular enactments which are, for the time being specified in the 9th Schedule. Their number, in 2000 is 284. They have been altogether immunised from attack, on the ground of contravention of any of the Fundamental Rights.

(c) Art. 31C, as inserted by the 25th Amendment Act, 1971, provided that any law which seeks to implement the Directive in Art.  $39(b)$  or  $39(c)$ , i.e., the plan of socialistic distribution of wealth, and the means of production shall not be void for inconsistency with Arts. 14 or 19.

But the effectiveness of Art. 31C was crippled by the decision of the majority of the Supreme Court in the case of Keshavananda<sup>194</sup> that judicial review is one of the essential features of the Indian Constitution which cannot be taken away by the process of amendment under Art. 368, and that, accordingly, that part of Art. 31C, which stated that any legislative declaration that a particular law was made to implement the Directives in Art. 39(b)-(c) shall not be open to question in a Court, is itself unconstitutional.

Undaunted by Keshavananda,<sup>194</sup> Parliament enlarged the scope of Art. 31C, by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, by including within its

protection any law to implement any of the Directive<br>Principles enumerated in Part IV of the Constitu-III. The 42nd Amend-

tion-not merely in Art. 39(b)-(c). As a result of this, if

any law of acquisition was made with the object of giving effect to any of the Directives, the reasonableness of such a law cannot be questioned under Art. 14 or 19. Minerva Mills<sup>195</sup> has, however, nullified this extension.

(d) The last faggot of exceptions Article 31D, has been repealed by the 43rd (Constitution Amendment) Act, 1977, and need not bother the reader.<sup>191</sup>

While the Congress Government for over a quarter of a century had eaten into the vitals of Art. 31(2) by successive<br>amendments, as outlined above, it was left to the IV. The 44th Amendment, 1978. Janata Government to eliminate the right of property

ment, 1976.

## CHAP. 8 FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

altogether from the list of Fundamental Rights in Part III. This has been effected by the 44th Amendment Act, 1978, which we have already discussed in connection with Judicial Review. Nevertheless, its incidents may be recapitulated in order to give a definite idea as to how much of the right to property remains under the Indian Constitution after April, 1979, and in what shape.

(a) Art.  $19(1)(f)$  has been repealed.

(b) Art. 31(1) has been taken out of Part III, and made a separate Article, viz., 300A, which reads as follows:

"No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law."

The result, in short, is that if an individual's property is taken away by a public official without legal authority or in excess of the power conferred by law in this behalf, he can no longer have speedy remedy direct from the Supreme Court under Art. 32 (because the right under Art. 300A is not a fundamental right). He shall have to find his remedy from the High Court under Art. 226 or by an ordinary suit.

(c) Cls.  $(2A)$ — $(6)$  of Art. 31 have been omitted.

(d) Cl. (2) of Art. 31 has been omitted,<sup>196</sup> but its Proviso has been transferred to Art. 30, as Cl. (1A) to that Article.

(e) Though Art. 31 itself has been deleted, Art. 31A which was originally inserted as an exception to Art. 31 has been retained, with the omission of any reference to Art. 31. Article 31A, therefore, remains to operate as an exception to Arts. 14 and 19, to shield the 5 classes of laws specified in Art. 31A(1). Curiously, however, the 2nd Proviso to Art. 31A(1) has been retained, giving a right to full compensation to the actual tiller, even though Art. 31 has been omitted and a reference to Art. 31 has been omitted from Cl. (1) to Art. 31A, to which the 2nd Proviso operates as an exception.

The above patchwork is bound to create confusion in the mind of a lay reader. It would, accordingly, be profitable to outline the vestiges of the right to compensation which survive the onslaught of the 44th Amendment. These are twofold:

Though the mass of citizens shall no longer have any guaranteed right to compensation if his property is acquired or requisi-Vestiges of the tioned and the Legislature shall have no constitutional right to property,<br>and comments obligation to provide for payment of any solatium to thereon. the expropriated owner, two exceptions to this general position are allowed by the 44th Amendment in two cases of *acquisition*:

(a) If the property acquired belongs to an educational institution established and administered by a minority, the law of acquisition must provide for such compensation as would not abrogate the right of a minority 'to establish and administer educational institution', which is guaranteed by Art. 30(1). Shorn of innuendo, this means that if the State chooses to acquire a minority educational institution, it must offer full market value or adequate compensation so that the minority community may set up that institution at a suitable alternative site.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 8

(b) If the State seeks to acquire the land which is personally cultivated by the owner and such land does not exceed the statutory ceiling, the State must pay to such owner full market value of his land as well as any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto. Though both the foregoing exceptions may be beneficial so far as they go, there is much to comment from the standpoint of constitutional law as from the national standpoint.

(i) As regards the concession in favour of a minority educational institution,--- it is somewhat inexplicable why no such guarantee should be made in favour of educational institutions managed by members of a majority community. Is not education as pure and adorable whether it comes through the Ganges or the Jordan? In their over-zealousness for the addition of a special guarantee in favour of the minority which the fathers of the original Constitution did not envisage,<sup>197</sup> the fathers of the 44th Amendment took no time to ponder that by eliminating Art. 31(2), they were taking away a right which had been guaranteed to all persons in India. Legally speaking, the new provision in Art. 30(1A) is a tail which has lost its head by the repeal of Art. 31(2).<sup>197</sup>

(ii) As to the right of a small tiller of land to full compensation for his land and building or other structures, one fails to understand why similar right should not be guaranteed to a poorer man who has not an inch of agricultural land but has a humble hut to lay his head at night. He may be a day labourer, a petty pensioner or a landless peasant who tills another man's land. Are they less deserving?

Would it not be pertinent to point out in this context that even in the 1977-Constitution of the USSR, there was Art. 13 which stated<sup>198</sup>.

... The personal property of citizens of the USSR may include articles of everyday use, personal consumption and convenience, the implements and other objects of a small holding . . . or for building an *individual dwelling*. The personal property of citizens and the right to inherit it are protected by the State.

In short, in the USSR, every individual had the guaranteed right to hold and inherit a dwelling, irrespective of his being an agriculturist, and the duty of the State to protect this right would obviously mean that the State cannot acquire or deprive the owner of his dwelling house unless otherwise provided by the Constitution.

The over-zealous political leaders of India should know that the provision in the 1982-Constitution of the Chinese Republic, too, is in the same strain. Though Art. 6 provides for social ownership of the 'means of production', Art. 13, at the same time guarantees to the individual to own personal property, acquired by his personal income:

"The State protects the right of citizens to own lawfully earned income, savings, houses and other lawful property."

Article 39, further, declares, as a fundamental right, that

"The citizens'... homes are inviolable."

The net result of the foregoing provisions seems to be that the State cannot take away an individual's dwelling house and similar personal

State onal property, even by legislation, so that no question of compensation for compulsory acquisition may arise.

In view of the drastic effects of the abolition of Arts.  $19(1)(f)$  and  $31(2)$ , some jurists in *India* have put forth their belief that the Supreme Court would come to the rescue of the expropriated owners by holding that notwithstanding the omission of such constitutionally guaranteed right to compensation, the Court would derive such right from the legislative power contained in Entry 42 of List III-'Acquisition and requisitioning of property', read with the common law doctrine of 'Eminent Domain'. Unfortunately, it has not been possible for the Author to persuade himself to this anachronistic assumption for reasons which have been elaborately given in the Author's bigger works.<sup>198</sup>

In the circumstances, there is a case for restoration of some relief for the poorer sections of property-owners (as distinguished from capitalists or owners of the means of production). But such relief can be more easily brought about by a further amendment of the Constitution than leaving it to the off-chances of 'judicial amendment'.

Abstract declarations of fundamental rights in the Art. 32: Constitu-Constitution are useless, unless there is the means to Remedies tional make them effective. Constitutional experience in all For Enforcement countries shows that the reality of the existence of Fundamental Rights. such rights is tested only in the Courts.

The power of the Courts to enforce obedience to the fundamental rights, again, depends not only upon the impartiality and independence of the Judiciary, but also upon the effectiveness of the instruments available to it to compel such obedience against the Executive or any other authority. Under the Anglo-American system, such means have been found in the writs or judicial processes such as habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto.

The Indian Constitution lays down the following provisions for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution, in the light of the above experience:

(a) The Fundamental Rights are guaranteed by the Constitution not only against the action of the Executive but also against that of the Legislature. Any act of the Executive or of the Legislature which takes away or abridges any of these rights shall be void and the Courts are empowered to declare it as void  $[Art. 13]$ . The Supreme Court strikes at the arbitrary action of the State.<sup>199</sup> It has jurisdiction to enforce the fundamental rights against private bodies and individuals and award compensation for violation of the fundamental rights. It can exercise its jurisdiction suo motu or on the basis of PIL.<sup>200</sup>

(b) Apart from the power to treat a law as void for being in contravention of the provisions of the Constitution guaranteeing the fundamental rights, the Judiciary has been armed with the power to issue the writs mentioned above (habeas corpus, etc.), in order that it may enforce such rights against any authority in the State, at the instance of an individual whose right has been violated.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA  $[CHAP. 8]$ 

The power to issue these writs for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights is given by the Constitution to the Supreme Court and High Courts [Arts. 32 and 226].

(c) The rights so guaranteed shall not be suspended except during a Proclamation of Emergency,-in the manner laid down by the Constitution  $[Art. 359]$ .

**Special Features of** the Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court<br>under Art. 32.

Though a fundamental right may be enforced by other proceedings, such as a declaratory suit under the ordinary law or an application under Art. 226 or by way of defence to legal proceedings brought against an individual, a proceeding under Art. 32 is described by the Constitution as a 'constitutional remedy' for the enforcement

of the Fundamental Rights included in Part III and the right to bring such proceeding before the Supreme Court is itself a fundamental right in Part III.

Article 32 is thus the cornerstone of the entire edifice set up by the Constitution. Commenting on this Article, in the Constituent Assembly, 201 Dr. Ambedkar said-

"If I was asked to name any particular article of the Constitution as the most important—an article without which this Constitution would be a nullity—I would not refer to any other article except this one. It is the very soul of the Constitution and the very heart of it.'

The relevant provisions in Cls. (1) and (2) of Art. 32 should be noticed:

"(1) The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed.

(2) The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs, including writs in the nature of *habeas corpus, mandamus*, prohibition, *quo warranto* and *certiorari*, whichever may be appropriate for the

(a) Art. 32, thus, provides a guaranteed remedy for the enforcement of those rights, and this remedial right is itself made a fundamental right, being included in Part  $III.^{202}$  The Supreme Court is thus constituted the protector and guarantor of fundamental rights, and it cannot, consistently with the responsibility so laid upon it, refuse to entertain applications seeking<br>protection against infringement of such right, on technical grounds.<sup>203</sup> Thus, though a writ may ordinarily be refused on the ground that the Petitioner has another adequate legal remedy open to him, an application under Art. 32 cannot be refused merely on this ground where a fundamental right appears to have been infringed. $^{204}$ 

(b) The Supreme Court can make any order appropriate to the circumstances, unfettered by the technicalities of the English 'Prerogative writs'.<sup>204</sup>

On the other hand.-

The sole object of Art. 32 is the enforcement of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Whatever other remedies may be open to a person aggrieved, he has no right to complain under Art. 32, where no 'fundamental' right has been infringed. For the same reason, no question other than relating to a fundamental right will be determined in a proceeding under Art. 32.<sup>205</sup>
The expression 'prerogative writ' is one of English common law which refers to the extraordinary writs granted by the 'Prerogative Writs'. Sovereign, as fountain of justice, on the ground of inadequacy of ordinary legal remedies. In course of time these writs came to be issued by the High Court of Justice as the agency through which the Sovereign exercised his judicial powers and these prerogative writs were issued as extraordinary remedies in cases where there was either no remedy available under the ordinary law or the remedy available was inadequate. These writs are habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto

In a sense, the power of the High Courts to issue these writs is wider than that of the Supreme Court inasmuch as under Art. 32 of the Consti-

tution the Supreme Court has the power to issue these writs only for the purpose of enforcement of the Fundamental Rights whereas under Art. 226 a High Court can issue these writs not only for the purpose of enforcement of Fundamental Rights but also for the redress of any other injury or illegality, owing to writs. contravention of the *ordinary law*, provided certain conditions are satisfied, for which, see Chap. 20,  $\mu$ ost.<sup>206</sup>

Thus,-a) an application to a High Court under Art. 226 will lie not only where a Fundamental Right has been infringed but also where some other limitation imposed by the Constitution, outside Part III, has been violated, e.g., where a State Legislature has imposed a sales tax in contravention of the limitations imposed by Art. 286.<sup>207</sup> But an application under Art. 32 shall not lie in any case unless the right infringed is a 'Fundamental Right' enumerated in Part III of the Constitution.<sup>205</sup>

(b) Another point of distinction between the two jurisdictions is that while the Supreme Court can issue a writ against any person or Government within the territory of India, a High Court can, under Art. 226, issue a writ against any person, Government or other authority only if such person, Government or authority is physically resident or located within the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court, that is, within the State to which the territorial jurisdiction of the particular High Court extends or if the cause of action arises within such jurisdiction.<sup>208</sup>

As stated earlier, the Supreme Court has been assigned by the Constitution a special role as "the protector and guarantor of fundamental rights,"201 by Art. 32(1).

In order to invoke the jurisdiction under Art. 32 to approach the Supreme Court directly, it has to be shown as to why the High Court had not been approached, could not be approached or it was futile to approach the High Court.<sup>209</sup>

Where, therefore, the infringement of a fundamental right has been established, the Supreme Court cannot refuse relief **Supreme** under Art. 32 on the ground-

The Court the as guardian of Fundamental Rights.

(a) That the aggrieved person may have his remedy from some other Court or under the ordinary

 $law: <sup>210</sup>$  or

(b) That disputed facts have to be investigated or evidence has to be taken before relief may be given to the petitioner;<sup>201</sup> or

(c) That the petitioner has not asked for the proper writ applicable to his case. In such a case, the Supreme Court must grant him the proper writ and, if necessary, modify it to suit the exigencies of the case.<sup>201</sup>

(d) Generally only the person effected may move the Court but the Supreme Court has held that in social or public interest actions, any person may move the Court. This is called expansion of the 'right to be heard'. It favours Public Interest Litigation.<sup>202</sup> Following English and American decisions, the Supreme Court has admitted exceptions from the strict rules relating to affidavit locus standi and the like in the case of a class of litigations classified as 'public interest litigation' (PIL) i.e., where the public in general are interested in the vindication of some right or the enforcement of some public duty.<sup>211</sup>

Another consequence which results from the guarantee of the constitutional remedy under Art. 32 is this:

Not only is this remedy immune from being overridden by legislation but any law which renders nugatory or illusory the Supreme Court's power to grant this remedy shall be void. This was illustrated in the leading case of A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, 119, 212 where the Supreme Court invalidated s. 14 of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, as it originally stood. The section was as follows:

"(1) No Court shall, except for the purpose of a prosecution for an offence punishable under sub-section (2), allow any statement to be made or any evidence to be given before it or the substance of any communication made under section 7 of the grounds on which a detention order has been made against any person or of any representation made by him against such order; and notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, no Court shall be entitled to require any public officer to produce before it, or to disclose the substance of, any such communication or representation made, or the proceedings of an advisory board or that part of the report of an advisory board which is confidential.

(2) It shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both for any person to disclose or publish without the previous authorisation of the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, any contents or matter purporting to be contents of any such communication or representation as is referred to in sub-section  $(1)$ ...

The Supreme Court struck down the above provision on the ground that it contravened Art. 32 by way of preventing the Supreme Court from effectively exercising its powers under Art. 32. The following observations of MAHAJAN J. are illuminating:

"This section is in the nature of an iron curtain around the acts of the authority making the order of preventive detention. The Constitution has guaranteed to the detained person the right to be told the grounds of detention. He has been given a right to make a representation [Vide article 22(5)], yet section 14 prohibits the disclosure of the grounds furnished to him or the contents of the representation made by him in a Court of law and makes a breach of this in imprisonment.

Now it is quite clear that if an authority passes an order of preventive detention for reasons not connected with any of the six subjects mentioned in the 7th

#### CHAP. 8 FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

Schedule, this court can always declare the detention illegal and release the detenu, but it is not possible for this court to function if there is a prohibition against<br>disclosing the grounds which have been served upon him. It is only by an<br>examination of the grounds that it is possible to say whether the not grounds at all. In this contingency it is the right of the detained person under article 32 to move this court for enforcing the right under Article 22(5) that he be given the real grounds on which the detention order is based. This Court would be disabled from exercising its functions under article 32 and adjudicating on the point that the grounds given satisfy the requirements of the sub-clause if it is not open to it to see the grounds that have been furnished. It is a guaranteed right of the person detained to have the very grounds which are the basis of the order of detention. This court would be entitled to examine the matter and to see whether the grounds furnished are the grounds on the basis of which he has been detained or they contain some other vague or irrelevant material. The whole purpose of furnishing a detained person with the grounds is to enable him to make a representation refuting these grounds and of proving his innocence. In order that this Court may be able to safeguard this fundamental right and to g this Court may be able to sateguard this tundamental right and to grant inti renet<br>it is absolutely essential that the detenu is not prohibited under penalty of punishment to<br>disclose the grounds to the Court and no injun stringent provision makes administration of the law by this court impossible and at the same time it deprives a detained person from obtaining justice from this court.<br>In my opinion, therefore, this section when it prohibits the disclosure of the grounds contravenes or abridges the rights given by Part I

There is provision in the Constitution for empowering courts other than the Supreme Court or the High Courts to issue the writs, by making a law of Parliament. But no such law has yet been passed,-with the result that no courts other than the Supreme Court or the High Courts have got the power to issue these writs. The incidents of the several kinds of writs which our Supreme Court and the High Courts are authorised by the Constitution to issue may now be noted.

A writ of habeas corpus is in the nature of an order calling upon the person who has detained another to produce the latter Scope of the Writs: before the Court, in order to let the Court know on 1. Habeas corpus. what ground he has been confined and to set him free

if there is no legal justification for the imprisonment. The words 'habeas corpus' literally mean 'to have a body'. By this writ, therefore, the court secures the body of a person who has been imprisoned to be brought before itself to obtain knowledge of the reason why he has been imprisoned and to set him free if there is no lawful justification for the imprisonment. The writ may be addressed to any person whatever, an official or a private person, who has another person in his custody and disobedience to the writ is met with punishment for contempt of court. The writ of habeas corpus is thus a very powerful safeguard to the subject against arbitrary acts not only of private individuals but also of the executive. Habeas corpus petition becomes infructuous if the detenu is produced before the Magistrate.<sup>213</sup>

The different purposes for which the writ of habeas corpus is available may, accordingly, be stated as follows:

(a) For the enforcement of fundamental rights. It has already been explained that under our Constitution the right of personal liberty is guaranteed against the State by Art. 21 which says that 'no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law'. Hence, if the Executive has arrested and detained any person without the authority of any law or in contravention of the procedure established by the law which authorises the detention, or the law which authorises the imprisonment is itself invalid or unconstitutional, the High Court or the Supreme Court may issue a writ of habeas corpus against the authority which has kept the person in custody and order the release of the person under detention.

(b) It will also issue where the order of imprisonment or detention is ultra vires the statute which authorises the imprisonment or detention.<sup>214</sup>

The writ of habeas corpus is, however, not issued in the following cases:

(i) Where the person against whom the writ is issued or the person who is detained is not within the jurisdiction of the Court.

(ii) To secure the release of a person who has been imprisoned by a court of law on a criminal charge.<sup>215</sup>

(iii) To interfere with a proceeding for contempt by a Court of record or by Parliament.

Mandamus literally means a command. It demands some activity on the part of the body or person to whom it is addressed. In II. Mandamus.

short, it commands the person to whom it is addressed to perform some public or quasi-public legal duty which he has refused to perform and the performance of which cannot be enforced by any other adequate legal remedy. It is, therefore, clear that mandamus will not issue unless the applicant has a legal right to the performance of legal duty of a public nature and the party against whom the writ is sought is bound to perform that duty. It is a discretionary remedy and the High Court may refuse to grant mandamus where there is an alternative remedy for redress of the injury complained of. In the matter of enforcement of fundamental rights, however, the question of alternative remedy does not weigh so much with the Court since it is the duty of the Supreme Court or the High Court to enforce the fundamental rights. In India, mandamus will lie not only against officers and other persons who are bound to do a public duty but also against the Government itself for, Arts. 226 and 361 provided that appropriate proceedings may be brought against the Government concerned. The writ is also available against inferior courts or other judicial bodies when they have refused to exercise their jurisdiction and thus to perform their duty. The purposes for which a writ may be issued may now be analysed as follows:

(a) For the enforcement of fundamental rights. Whenever a public officer or a Government has done some act which violates the fundamental right of a person, the Court would issue a writ of mandamus restraining the public officer or the Government from enforcing that order or doing that act against the person whose fundamental right has been infringed.

the petitioner, who was otherwise eligible for appointment to the Subordinate Civil Judicial Service, was not selected owing to the operation of a 'Communal Rotation Order' which infringed the fundamental right guaranteed to the petitioner by Art. 16(1), the Court issued an order directing the State of Madras "to consider and dispose of the petitioner's application for the post after taking it on the file on its merits and without applying the rule of communal rotation".216

(b) Apart from the enforcement of fundamental rights, mandamus is available from a High Court for various other purposes, e.g.,-

(i) To enforce the performance of a statutory duty where a public officer has got a power conferred by the Constitution or a statute. The Court may issue a mandamus directing him to exercise the power in case he refuses to do it.

(ii) The writ will also lie to compel any person to perform his public duty where the duty is imposed by the Constitution or a statute or statutory instrument.

(iii) To compel a court or judicial tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction when it has refused to exercise it.

(iv) To direct a public official or the Government not to enforce a law which is unconstitutional.

The Courts are normally reluctant to issue any direction to government for making a law.<sup>217</sup>

Mandamus will not be granted against the following persons:

(i) The President, or the Governor of a State, for the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of those powers and duties [Art. 361, post].  $\frac{1}{2}$ 

(ii) Mandamus does not lie against a private individual or body whether incorporated or not except where the State is in collusion with such private party,<sup>215</sup> in the matter of contravention of any provision of the Constitution, or a statute or a statutory instrument.<sup>218</sup>

The writ of prohibition is a writ issued by the Supreme Court or a

High Court to an inferior court forbidding the latter to **III.** Prohibition. continue proceedings therein in excess of its jurisdiction or to usurp a jurisdiction with which it is not legally vested. In other words, the object of the writ is to compel inferior courts to keep themselves within the limits of their jurisdiction. The writ of prohibition differs from the writ of mandamus in that while mandamus commands activity, prohibition commands inactivity. Further, while mandamus is available not only against judicial authorities but also against administrative authorities, prohibition as well as certiorari are issued only against judicial or quasi-judicial authorities. Hence, prohibition is not available against a public officer who is not vested with judicial functions. Where excess of jurisdiction is apparent on the face of the proceedings, a writ of prohibition is not a matter of discretion but may be had of right. In India, a writ of prohibition may be issued not only in cases of absence or excess of jurisdiction but also in cases where the court or

tribunal assumes jurisdiction under a law which itself contravenes some fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution. The Supreme Court can issue the writ only where a fundamental right is affected by reason of the jurisdictional defect in the proceedings.

Though prohibition and certiorari are both issued against Courts or tribunals exercising judicial or quasi-judicial powers, certiorari is issued to quash the order or decision of the tribunal while prohibition is issued to prohibit the tribunal from making the ultra vires order or decision. It follows, therefore, that while prohibition is available during the pendency of the proceedings and before the order is made, certiorari can be issued only after the order has been made.

Briefly speaking, therefore, while prohibition is available at an earlier stage, certiorari is available at a later stage, on similar IV. Certiorari. grounds. The object of both is to secure that the jurisdiction of an inferior court or tribunal is properly exercised and that it does not usurp the jurisdiction which it does not possess.

The conditions necessary for the issue of the writ of certiorari are

I. There should be a tribunal or officer having legal authority to determine questions affecting rights of subjects and having a duty to act judicially.

II. Such tribunal or officer must have acted without jurisdiction or in excess of the legal authority vested in such quasi-judicial authority, or in contravention of the rules of natural justice or there is an 'error apparent on the face of its record'.

III. The Supreme Court, early, took the view that the writ of certiorari would not issue against purely administrative action. It would issue only if the authority has a *duty* to proceed judicially, that is to say, to come to a decision after hearing the parties interested in the matter and without reference to any extraneous consideration.<sup>219</sup>

But later decisions have obliterated the distinction between administrative and quasi-judicial bodies. The current view is that even if the governing statute does not require that before making an order affecting an individual, he must be heard, such a requirement would be implied by the Court where the right of property or some other civil right of the individual is affected. To omit to do this is to deny natural justice, and in such cases, the Court may quash the so-called administrative decision, by means of a writ of certiorari, under Art. 226.220

IV. A tribunal may be said to act without jurisdiction in any of the following circumstances-

(a) Where the court is not properly constituted, that is to say, where persons who are not qualified to sit on the tribunal have sat on it and pronounced the decision complained against.

(b) Where the subject-matter of enquiry is beyond the scope of the tribunal according to the law which created it.

# CHAP. 8 FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

(c) Where the court has assumed a jurisdiction on the basis of a wrong decision of facts upon the existence of which the jurisdiction of the tribunal depends.

(d) Where there has been a failure of justice either because the tribunal has violated the principles of natural justice or because its decision has been obtained by fraud, collusion or corruption.

V. When the decision of an inferior tribunal is vitiated by an error 'apparent on the face of the record', it is liable to be quashed by certiorari, even though the Court may have acted within its jurisdiction. 'Error', in this context, means 'error of law'. Where the Tribunal states on the face of the order the grounds on which they made it and it appears that in law these grounds were not such as to warrant the decision to which they had come, certiorari would issue to quash the decision.<sup>221</sup>

In all such cases a High Court can issue a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the inferior tribunal; and the Supreme Court can also issue the writ in such cases, provided some fundamental right has also been infringed by the order complained against.

Quo warranto is a proceeding whereby the court enquires into the legality of the claim which a party asserts to a public V. Quo warranto. office, and to oust him from its enjoyment if the claim be not well founded.

The conditions necessary for the issue of a writ of quo warranto are as follows:

(i) The office must be public and it must be created by a statute or by the constitution itself.

(ii) The office must be a substantive one and not merely the function or employment of a servant at the will and during the pleasure of another.

(iii) There has been a contravention of the Constitution or a statute or statutory instrument, in appointing such person to that office.<sup>222</sup>

The fundamental basis of the proceeding of quo warranto is that the public has an interest to see that an unlawful claimant does not usurp a public office. It is, however, a discretionary remedy which the Court may grant or refuse according to the facts and circumstances of each case. A writ of quo warranto may, thus, be refused where it is vexatious or where it would be futile in its result or where the petitioner is guilty of laches or where there is an alternative remedy for ousting the usurper. Where the application challenges the validity of an appointment to a public office, it is maintainable at the instance of any person, whether any fundamental or other legal right of such person has been infringed or not.

A writ of quo warranto lies against the person who is not entitled to hold an office of public nature and is only an usurper of the office. Such a person is required to show, by what authority he is entitled to hold that office. The challenge can be made on the grounds such as he does not fulfil the required qualifications or suffers from any disqualification debarring him to hold such office.<sup>223</sup>

Quo warranto is thus a very powerful instrument for safeguarding against the usurpation of public offices.

Parliament's power The limitations upon the enforcement of the to modify or Fundamental Rights are as follows: restrict damental Rights.

(i) Parliament shall have the power to modify the application of the Fundamental Rights<sup>224</sup> to the members of the Armed Forces, Police Forces or intelligence organisations so as to ensure proper discharge of their duties and maintenance of discipline amongst them [Art. 33].

In exercise of this power, Parliament has enacted the Army and Air Force Acts of 1950 and the Navy Act, 1957, which empower the Central Government to make Rules restricting the fundamental rights of the defence personnel, for the sake of discipline,-which is absolutely essential to maintain the security of India. By a Circular issued under such Rules, Government of India has ordered that no concession can be offered in favour of any member of the Defence Forces for the purpose of offering prayers during office hours. It is a pity that a fundamentalist Muslim Organisation, named All India Muslim Forum, has raised objection against the Circular articulated by Muslim members in Parliament, on various grounds. None of these grounds are, however, tenable in view of the express provision in Art. 33 of the Constitution of India, which silences the argument that no such restriction was imposed in respect of Muslims during the British regime and also that it would hurt the 'sentiments' of the Muslims. Nor does the argument that the withdrawal of such concession would be contrary to the guarantee of secularism hold water because, firstly, Art. 25(1) makes it 'expressly' subject to the other provisions of this Part, in which Art. 33 is<br>included, Secondly, what Art. 25 guarantees is equality of treatment as amongst different religions. If no such concession exists in favour of the members of any other religion, no question of discrimination against Muslims can possibly arise. Above all, the defence of the nation is a secular duty of each citizen of India, regardless of his religious beliefs or rites. Nothing can be allowed by the independent Republic which can possibly jeopardise the defence of the Nation.

Needless to say, this dangerous move should be nipped in the bud before it assumes an uncontrollable situation, in the name of Muslims 'sentiment'. Any softness shown to it would be anti-national.

A similar instance was the claim of a section of Muslims to postpone the elections fixed for February, 1995, on the ground of Ramzan. This has, of course, been turned down by the Election Commission on the ground that no such religious plea can stop the electoral process. It is also doubtful if there is any religious scripture which requires Muslims to suspend their normal duties on the days of fasting, which is spread over one month.

(ii) When martial law has been in force in any area, Parliament may, by law, indemnify any person in the service of the Union or a State for any act done by him in connection with the maintenance or restoration of order

## CHAP. 8 FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

in such area or validate any sentence passed or act done while martial law was in force  $[Art. 34]$ .

(iii) The fundamental rights guaranteed by the **Suspension**  $of$ Constitution will remain suspended, while a Procla-**Fundamental** during mation of Emergency is made by the President under<br>on of  $A_{r}$  at 359 keep and The effect of such Presidentian in **Rights** Proclamation Art. 352 [see post]. The effect of such Proclamation in Emergency. this behalf is twofold-

(a) As soon as a Proclamation of Emergency is made, the State shall be freed from the limitations imposed by Art. 19. This means that the Legislature shall be competent to make any law and the Executive shall be at liberty to take any action, even though it contravenes or restricts the right of freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association, movement, residence, profession or occupation. So far as these rights are concerned, the citizen shall thus have no protection against the executive or legislative authorities during the operation of the Proclamation of Emergency. The enlargement of the power of the State under Art. 358 will continue only so long as the Proclamation itself remains in operation; Art. 19 will revive as soon as the Proclamation expires. But the citizen shall have no remedy for acts done against him during the period of the Proclamation, in violation of the above rights  $[Art. 358]$ .

(b) The other consequence depends upon the issue of a further Order by the President. Where a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, the President may be Order declare that the right to move a Court for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights shall remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation remains in force  $[Art. 359]$ . In such a case, however, the right to move the Courts would be revived after the Proclamation ceases to be in force, or earlier, if so specified in the President's Order. In other words, if such an Order is issued, the Supreme Court and the High Courts shall be powerless to issue the prerogative writs or to make any other order for the enforcement of any fundamental right, including those which are conferred by Articles other than Art. 19 with the exception of those conferred by Arts. 20 and 21.

This Order of the President, however, shall not be final. Such Order shall, as soon as may be after it is made, be laid before each House of Parliament, and it will be within the competence of Parliament to disapprove of it.<sup>225</sup>

The 44th Amendment Act, 1978, has further The 44th Amendprovided that a law or executive order will be shieldment, 1978. ed under Art. 358 or 359 only if the law in question

contains a recital to the effect that it has been made in relation to the Proclamation of Emergency; and the executive order has been issued under such law. Secondly, Arts. 20-21 cannot be suspended by any Order under Art. 359.

As the Constitution stands today, two other matters must be mentioned which limit the operation of the Fundamental Rights, as they were devised in the 1949-Constitution, and are not confined to times of 'Emergency' but operate even in normal times. These are:

I. The exceptions to Fundamental Rights; and
# INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 8

II. The Fundamental Duties.

I. Arts. 31A-31D, introduced by successive amendments, constitute exceptions to the application of Fundamental Rights, wholly, or partially.<sup>6</sup> Of these, Art. 31D has subseque-**Exceptions** to **Fundamental** ntly been repealed (by the 43rd Amendment Act, Rights. 1977).

II. The Fundamental Duties<sup>226</sup> are ten in number, incorporated in Art. 51A [Part IVA], which has been inserted by the **Fundamental** 42nd Amendment Act, 1976. Under this Article, it shall be the duty of every citizen of India-

- (i) to abide by the Constitution and respect the National Flag and the National Anthem:
- to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for  $(ii)$ freedom;
- (iii) to protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;

 $(iv)$ to defend the country;

- to promote the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India;  $(v)$
- $(vi)$ to preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;
- to protect and improve the natural environment;  $(vii)$
- to develop the scientific temper and spirit of inquiry;  $(viii)$
- $(ix)$ to safeguard public property;
- $(x)$ to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity.
- $227(xi)$  who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.

In this context, it would be better to remove a misnomer involved in

**'Composite** culture'.

the expression 'composite culture' in Cl. (f) of Art. 51Å. The Supreme Court has now pointed out that the foundation of this composite culture is the

Sanskrit language and literature which is the great binding force "for the different peoples of this great country and it should be preferred in the educational system for the preservation of that heritage,-apart from the duty of the Government under Art. 351".172

To quote the Supreme Court-

"Though the people of this country differed in a number of ways, they all were proud to regard themselves as participants in a *common* heritage, and that heritage, *emphatically*, is the heritage of Sanskrit".<sup>173</sup>

The reason is that the original population of India was Hindu. Thereafter this country was subjected to Muslim and British rule. Because of its wonderful tolerance, the Hindu culture imbibed these alien cultures and thus grew up a 'composite culture' in India [Para 118]:174

"Hindu religion developed resilience to accommodate and imbibe with tolerance the cultural richness with religious assimilation and became a land of religious tolerance  $[Para 118]^{174}$  . each religion made its contribution to enrich the *composite* Indian culture as a happy blend or synthesis. Our religious tolerance (thus) received reflections in *our Constitutional* creed  $[Para 126]$ .<sup>174</sup>

Of course, there is no provision in the Constitution for direct enforce-

ment of any of these Duties<sup>228</sup> nor for any sanction to prevent their violation. But it may be expected that in determining the constitutionality of any law, if a Court

finds that it seeks to give effect to any of these Duties, it may consider such law to be 'reasonable' in relation to Art. 14 or 19, and thus save such law from unconstitutionality. It would also serve as a warning to reckless citizens against anti-social activities such as burning the Constitution, destroying public property and the like.<sup>229</sup>

The Supreme Court has held that since the Duties are obligatory for a citizen, it would follow that the State should also strive to achieve the same goal. The Court may, therefore, issue suitable directions in these matters, in appropriate cases.<sup>230</sup>

It should be pointed out in the present context that by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, various conditions and limitations had been imposed on the writ jurisdiction of both the Supreme Court and the High Courts, by introducing provisions such as Arts. 32A, 131A, 144A, 226A, 228A, and substituting Art. 226 itself [see Author's *Constitution Amendment Acts*, pp. 100-07; 126-28]. All these fetters h Arts. 32 and 226 have been restored to their original condition.

But Arts. 323A and 323B, inserted in 1976, have been kept in tact. In pursuance of Art. 323A, the Administrative Tribunals Act has been enacted in 1985, by which service rut 5250, the Administrative Tribunals Act has been enacted in 1550, by which service<br>matters have been taken away from the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Art. 226,<br>and vested in Administrative Tribunals, so far as infringing the powers of judicial review of the Supreme Court and the High Courts under<br>Arts. 32 and 222/227 as unconstitutional.
