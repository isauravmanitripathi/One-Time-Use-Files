# **RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC SERVANTS**

OUR Constitution views the Union and the States as juristic persons, capable of owning and acquiring property, making Property of the<br>Union and the contracts, carrying on trade or business, bringing and<br>defending legal actions, just as private persons,<br>subject to modifications specified in the Constitution States.

itself.

The Union and a State can acquire property in several ways-

(a) Succession. Broadly speaking, the property, assets, rights and liabilities that belonged to the Dominion of India or a Governor's Province or an Indian State at the commencement of the Constitution devolved by virtue of the Constitution, on the Union or the corresponding State under the Constitution [Arts. 294-295].

(b) Bona Vacantia. Any property in the territory of India which, if this Constitution had not come into operation, would have accrued to His Majesty or as the case may be, to the Ruler of an Indian State by escheat or lapse, or as bona vacantia for want of a rightful owner, shall, if it is property situate in a State, vest in such State, and shall in any other case, vest in the Union [Art. 296]. Thus, the disputed property of a person dying a civil death (not heard of for more than seven years) without leaving any heir, would vest in the Gaon Sabha and should be recorded in its name even if no objection has been filed by it.<sup>1</sup>

(c) Things underlying the Ocean. All lands, minerals and other things of value underlying the ocean within the territorial waters of India shall vest only in the Union  $[Art. 297]$ .

(d) Compulsory Acquisition or Requisition by Law. Both the Union and State Legislatures shall be competent to compulsorily acquire or requisition property by making law, under Entry 42, List III, Sch. VII.

The constutional obligation to pay compensation has been abolished, by the omission of Art. 31(2) by the 44th Amendment Act, 1978. findell la

(e) Acquisition under Executive Power. The Government of India or a State may make contracts and acquire property, say by purchase or exchange, just as a private individual, in exercise of their respective powers, and for the purposes of their respective Governments [Arts. 298] and the

decision of the government in granting contracts/licences to private bodies/companies can be questioned only the grounds of bad faith, based on irrational or irrelevant considerations, non-compliance with the prescribed procedure or violation of any constitutional or statutory provision.<sup>2</sup>. But for compulsorily taking a person's property, a law will be required to authorise it  $[Art. 300A]$ .

The Union or a State Government is competent to carry on any trade or business and make contracts for that purpose, in exercise of its executive power. Such business shall, however, be subject to

regulation by the competent Legislature. That is to say, if the Union Government takes up a business

relating to a subject (say, agriculture) which is included in the State List, the business will be subject to the legislative jurisdiction of the State Legislature [Art. 298, Prov. (a).

The Union or a State, while legislating with respect to a trade or business carried on by itself, is immune from a constitutional limitation to which it would have been otherwise subject. If an ordinary law excludes a citizen from carrying on a particular business, wholly or partially, the reasonableness of such law has to be tested under Art. 19(6). Thus, if the State creates a monopoly in favour of a private trade without any reasonable justification, such law is liable to be held unconstitutional by the Courts. But if a law creates a monopoly in favour of the State itself as a trader, whether to the partial or complete exclusion of citizens,<sup>3</sup> the reasonableness of such law cannot be questioned by the Courts [Exception (ii) to Art. 19(6)].

In short, it is competent for the Union or a State not only to enter into a trade but also to create a monopoly in its own favour in respect of such trade. This is what is popularly known as the 'nationalisation' of a trade.<sup>4</sup>

The power of either Government to take loans Power to borrow has already been dealt with. Money.

As stated already, both the Union and State Governments have the

**Formalities** for Government Contracts.

power to enter into contracts like private individuals, in relation to the respective spheres of their executive power. But this contractual power of the Government is subject to some special formalities required by the

Constitution, in addition to those laid down by the Law of Contract which governs any contract made in India.

The reason for imposing these special conditions is that contracts by Government raise some problems which do not or cannot possibly arise in the case of contracts entered into by private persons. Thus, there should be a definite procedure according to which contracts must be made by its agents, in order to bind the Government; otherwise public funds may be depleted by clandestine contracts made by any and every public servant. The formalities for contracts made in the exercise of the executive power of the Union or of a State, as laid down in Art. 299, are that the contract-

(a) must be executed by a person duly authorised by the President or Governor, as the case may be;

(b) must be executed by such person 'on behalf of' the President or Governor, as the case may be;

(c) must be 'expressed to be made by' the President or Governor, as the case may be.

If any of these conditions are not complied with, the contract is not binding on or enforceable *against* the Government,<sup>5</sup> though a suit may lie against the officer who made the contract, in his personal capacity.

### The right of the Government to sue and its Suability of the<br>Union and a State. liability to be sued, like a private individual in the ordinary Courts, is also subject to certain special considerations.

# Article 300(1) of the Constitution says-

"The Government of India may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the Government of a State may sue or be sued by the name of the State and may, subject to any provisions which may be made by Act of Parliament or of the Legislature of such State enacted by virtue of powers conferred by this Constitution, sue or be sued in relation to their respective affairs in the like cases as<br>the Dominion of India and the corresponding Provinces or the corresponding Indian States might have sued or been sued if this Constitution had not been enacted."

This Article, however, does not give rise to any cause of action, but merely says that the State can sue or be sued, as a juristic personality, in matters where a suit would lie against the Government had not the Constitution been enacted, subject to legislation by the appropriate Legislature. No such legislation has, however, been undertaken so far. For the substantive law as to the liability of the State, therefore, we have to refer to the law as it stood before the commencement of the Constitution.

#### Right to Sue. I.

So far as the right to sue is concerned, the Government of India may sue by the name of the 'Union of India', while a State may sue by the name of that State, e.g., 'State of Bihar'. Either Government may sue not only a private person but also another Government. Thus, the Union may bring a suit against one or more States; while a State may sue another State or the Union [Art. 131]. It is to be noted that when the suit is against a private individual, the suit will have to be instituted in the Court of the lowest jurisdiction, according to the law of procedure; but in the case of a suit between two Governments, it must be instituted in the highest tribunal, namely, the Supreme Court, which has exclusive original jurisdiction over such federal litigation.

#### Liability to be Sued. Î .

In this matter, a distinction is to be made between contractual liability and the liability for torts or civil wrongs, because such distinction has been observed in India since the days of the East India Company, up to the commencement of the Constitution, and that position is maintained by Art. 300 of the Constitution, subject to legislation by Parliament.

#### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 29]

(a) Contract. In India, direct suit had been allowed against the East India Company, the Secretary of State or the existing Governments in matters of contract, instead of a petition of right by which a British subject sought relief from the Crown, as a matter of grace. The Government of India Acts expressly empowered the Government to enter into contracts with private individuals and the corresponding provision in the Constitution in Art. 299(1) maintains that position.

Subject to the formalities prescribed by Art. 299 and to statutory conditions or limits, the contractual liability of the State, under our Constitution, is the same as that of an individual under the ordinary law of contract.

 $(b)$ Torts. The liability of the State under the existing law, for actionable wrongs committed by its servants, cannot be so simply stated as in the case of contracts. The state of the law is unnecessarily complicated by reason of its being founded on the position of the British Crown under the Common Law and of the East India Company upon its supposed representation of the sovereignty of the Crown, both of which have become archaic, owing to the changes in history and law.

Even in England, the Common Law maxim that the 'King can do no wrong' has been superseded by the Crown Proceedings Act, 1947. Nevertheless, in the absence of any such corresponding legislation, Courts in India have no alternative than to follow the existing case-law which is founded on the old English theory of immunity of the State, founded on the maxim 'King can do no wrong'.

The existing law in India, thus, draws a distinction between the sovereign and non-sovereign functions of the Government and holds that Government cannot be sued for torts committed by the Government or its officers in the exercise of its 'sovereign' functions.

Thus, it has been held-

(A) No action lies against the Government for injury done to an individual in the course of exercise of the sovereign functions to the Government, such as the following:

(i) Commandeering goods during war; (ii) making or repairing a military road; (iii) administration of justice; (iv) improper arrest, negligence or trespass by Police officers; (v) wrongs committed by officers in the performance of duties imposed upon them by the Legislature, unless, of course, the statute itself prescribes the limits or conditions under which the executive acts are to be performed; or the wrongful act was expressly authorised or ratified by the State; (vi) loss of movables from Government custody owing to negligence of officers; (vii) payment of money in custody of Government to a person other than the rightful owner, owing to negligence of an officer in the exercise of statutory duty, where Government does not derive any benefit from such transaction, e.g., by a Treasury Officer paying money to a wrong person on a forged cheque owing to negligence in performing his statutory duty to compare the signature.

But gradually the ratio of Kasturi Lal's case<sup>6</sup> and the list of sovereign functions is being limited. The Supreme Court has adopted a pro-people

#### RIGHTS AND LIABL. OF THE GOVT. AND PUB. SER. **CHAP. 29]**

approach. In Rudul Shah<sup>7</sup> in a writ petition the Court ordered compensation to be paid for deprivation of liberty. In Nagendra Rao<sup>8</sup> the Supreme Court observed that no civilised system can permit an executive to play with the people of a country and claim to be sovereign. To place the State above the law is unjust and unfair to the citizen. In the modern sense the distinction between sovereign and non-sovereign functions does not exist. The ratio of Kasturi Lal<sup>6</sup> is available to those rare and limited cases where the statutory authority acts as a delegate of such functions for which it cannot be sued in a Court of law.

The theory of sovereign power, propounded in Kasturi Lal case has yielded to new theories and is no longer available in a welfare state in which functions of the government are manifold, all of which cannot be said to be the activities relating to exercise of sovereign powers. Running of a railway is a commercial activity. Establishing the Yatri Niwas at various railway stations to provide lodging and boarding facilities to the passengers on payment of charges is a part of commercial activity of the Union of India which cannot be equated with the exercise of sovereign power. The employees deputed to run the Railways and to manage the establishment, including the railway stations and the Yatri Niwas, are essential components of the government machinery carrying on commercial activity. If any of such employees commits an act of tort, the Union Government can be held liable in damages to the person wronged by those employees. As observed in Common Cause, A Registered Society v. Union of India, (1999) 6 SCC 667 the efficacy of Kasturi Lal case as a binding precedent has been eroded. Hence, the Supreme Court upheld the award against the Railways of a compensation of Rs. ten lakhs by the High Court to a foreign passenger, victim of gang-rape committed by the railway employees in a room of a Railway Yatri Niwas booked in their name.<sup>9</sup>

Likewise the persons employed in government hospitals cannot claim sovereign immunity and the government will be liable for their tortious  $acts.<sup>10</sup>$ 

(B) On the other hand, a suit lies against the Government for wrongs done by public servants in the course of transactions which a trading company or a private person could engage in such as the following:

(i) Injury due to the negligence of servants of the Government employed in a dockyard or a railway; (ii) trespass upon or damage done to private property in the course of a dispute as to right to land between Government and the private owner, even though committed in the course of a colourable exercise of statutory powers; (iii) the State is liable to be sued for restitution of the profits unlawfully made, just as a private owner, e.g., where Government retains property or moneys unlawfully seized by its officers, a suit lies against the Government for its recovery, with interest; (iv) defamation contained in a resolution issued by Government; (v) injury caused by a Government vehicle while such vehicle was not being engaged in carrying out any sovereign function,<sup>6</sup> or engaged in famine relief work.<sup>11</sup>

Though the State itself is immune from liability in certain cases already noted owing to historical reasons, our Constitution Suability of Heads does not grant any immunity to a public servant for of State. his official acts which are unlawful under the ordinary

#### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 29]

law of the land. The only exception to this rule is a limited immunity granted to the heads of State, namely, the President and a Governor,<sup>12</sup> both for their political and personal acts, while in office  $[Art. 361]$ .

Immunity of Presi-<br>dent or Governor<br>for official acts.

I. Official Acts. The immunity given for official acts of the President or the Governor is absolute but it is limited only to the President and the Governor personally, and no other person can shield himself from legal liability on the plea that it was done under orders or the President or

## a Governor.<sup>12</sup>

The President or a Governor is immune from legal action and cannot be sued in a Court, whether during office or thereafter, for any act done or purported to be done by them or for any contract made  $[Art. 299(2)]$  in exercise of their powers and duties as laid down by the Constitution or by any law made thereunder  $[Art. 361(1)]$ . Though the President is liable to be impeached under Art. 61 and the Governors may be dismissed by the President,-for any unconstitutional act done in exercise of their official powers, no action lies in the Courts.

It follows from the rule of personal immunity that no Court can compel the President or the Governor to exercise any power or to perform any duty nor can a Court compel him to forbear exercising his power or performing his duties. He is not amenable to the writs or directions issued by any Court.

The remedy to an individual for wrongful official acts of the President or a Governor is twofold-

(i) To bring appropriate proceedings against the respective Government itself, where such proceedings lie [Art. 361(1), Prov. 2].

(ii) To bring an action against the public servant, individually, who has executed the wrongful order of the President or Governor, and must, therefore, answer to the aggrieved individual, under the ordinary law of crimes or civil wrongs, subject to limitations, to be explained shortly.

In this connection, it should be noted that while the Constitution grants of personal immunity to the President or a Governor for

**Position** Ministers.

official acts, no such immunity is granted to their<br>Ministers.<sup>12</sup> But by virtue of the peculiar position of

Ministers as regards official acts of the President or the Governor, as the case may be, it is not possible to make a Minister liable in a court of law, for any official act done in the name of the President or Governor. As pointed out earlier, the position in this respect in India differs from that in the United Kingdom. In *England*, every official act of the Crown must be countersigned by a Minister who is responsible to the law and the Courts for that act. But though the principle of ministerial responsibility has been adopted in our Constitution, both at the Centre and in the States, the principle of legal responsibility has not been introduced in the English sense. There is no requirement that the acts of the President or of the Governor must be countersigned by a Minister. Further, the Courts are precluded from enquiring as to what advice was tendered by the Ministers to the President or the Governor. It is clear, therefore, that the Ministers shall not be liable

for official acts done on their advice. But there is no immunity for offences committed in their personal capacity.<sup>12</sup>

II. Personal Acts. The immunity of the President or a Governor for acts unlawful personal acts committed by him during the Personal during Term of term of his office is limited to the duration of such Office. term.

(a) As regards crimes, no proceedings can be brought against them or continued while they are in office: but there is nothing to prevent such proceedings after their office is terminated<sup>13</sup> by expiry of term, dismissal or otherwise.

(b) As regards civil proceedings, there is no such immunity, but the Constitution imposes a procedural condition:

Civil proceedings may be brought against the President or a Governor, in respect of their *personal* acts, but only if two months' notice in writing has been delivered to the President or Governor.

As stated before, the Constitution makes no distinction in favour of Government servants as to their personal liability for any unlawful act done by them whether in their official or personal capacity. There is only one

provision in the Constitution relating to the liability of **Suability of Public** public servants; but the general law imposes certain Officials. conditions as regards their liability for official acts, in view of their peculiar position. These may be analysed as follows:

(i) Contract. If a contract made by a Government servant in his official capacity complies with the formalities laid down in Art. 299, it is the Government concerned which will be liable in respect of the contract and not the officer who executed the contract  $[Art. 299(2)].$ 

If, however, the contract is not made in term of Art. 299(2), the officer who executed it would be *personally* liable under it, even though he may not have derived any personal benefit.

(ii) Torts. As stated earlier, in India, the Government is not liable to answer in damages for its 'sovereign' acts. In such cases, the officer through whom such act is done is also immune.

In other cases, action will lie against the Government as well as the officer personally, unless-

(a) the act has been done, bona fide, in the performance of duties imposed by a statute;

(b) he is a judicial officer, within the meaning of the Judicial Officers' Protection Act, 1850. This Act gives absolute immunity from a civil proceeding to a judicial officer for acts done in the discharge of his official duty. $13$ 

But any civil action, whether in contract or in torts, against a public officer "in respect of any act *purported* to be done by such public officer in his official capacity", is subject to the procedural limitations in ss. 80-82 of the Code of Civil Procedure which include a two months' notic condition precedent to a suit.<sup>4</sup>

### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 29]

(iii) Crimes. The criminal liability of a public servant is the same as that of an ordinary citizen except that-

(a) There is no liability for judicial acts or for acts done in pursuance of judicial orders [ss. 77-78, Indian Penal Code].<sup>13</sup>

(b) Officers, other than judicial, are also immune for any act which they, by reason of some mistake of law or fact, in good faith, believed themselves to be bound by law to do [s. 76, I.P.C.].<sup>13</sup>

(c) Where a public servant who is not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the Central or State Government is accused of an offence, committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, no Court can take cognizance of such offence without the previous sanction of the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be [s. 197, Criminal Procedure Code].<sup>14</sup>

(iv) For acts done for the maintenance or restoration of order in an area where martial law was in force, Parliament may exempt the officers concerned from liability by validating such acts by making an Act of Indemnity [Art. 34].
