**CHAPTER 31** ELECTIONS

AIGH RG MOTHERS CONTO PRODUCED

WHILE the Constitution lays down the procedure for the election of the President<sup>1</sup> [Art. 54] and the Vice-President<sup>1</sup> [Art. 66], the procedure for election to the Legislatures of the Union and the States Elections. is left to legislation, the Constitution itself providing certain principles. These principles are-

(a) There is no provision for communal, separate or special representation. There shall be one electoral roll for every territorial constituency for election to either House of Parliament or to the State Legislature and no person shall be excluded from such roll on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or any of them  $[Art. 325]$ .

(b) The election shall be on the basis of adult suffrage, i.e., every person who is a citizen of India and who is not less than 18<sup>2</sup> years of age shall be entitled to vote at the election provided he is not disqualified by any provision of the Constitution or of any law made by the appropriate Legislature on the ground of non-residence, unsoundness of mind, crime, or corrupt or illegal practice  $[Art. 326]$ .

Power Legislature.

Subject to the above principles and the other provisions of the of Constitution, the power to make laws relating to all matters in connection with the election not only to the

Houses of Parliament, but also to the Houses of the Legislature of a State belongs to the Union Parliament [Art. 327; Entry 72, List I, 7th Sch.]. The State Legislature has, however, a subsidiary power in this respect. It can legislate on all electoral matters relating to the State Legislature insofar as such matters are not covered by legislation by Parliament. The laws of the State Legislature shall, in other words, be valid only if they are not repugnant to laws made by Parliament and, of course, to the provisions of the Constitution  $[Art. 328]$ . Parliament has enacted the Representation of the People Acts, 1950, 1951, as well as the Delimitation Commission Acts, 1962, 1972, to prescribe the mode of election, and the formation and delimitation of the constituencies relating to election.

The procedure prescribed by these Acts is voting based on singlemember territorial constituencies. While proportional Single-member representation has been prescribed for election to the **Territorial** office of the President and the Vice-President, that Constituencies. system has not been adopted for election to the

Legislature of the Union and the States.

Disputes are bound to arise in the matter of such a big-scale election on various points, such as, whether the procedure for election was properly

## INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA $[CHAP. 31]$

Decision of disputes relating to<br>Election of Members.

followed or whether any candidate returned as member suffered from any disqualification under the law or the Constitution, or whether a candidate who

ought to have been returned has been, in fact, declared not elected. For the decision of such disputes, the Constitution provides [Art. 329] that the ordinary courts of the land will have no jurisdiction and that any question relating to an election can be agitated only by an election petition, as provided for by law.

Article 329 provides-

"Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution-

(b) No election to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the Legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by the appropriate Legislature."

Under the Representation of the People Act, as it stood at the end of 1996, the power to decide an election petition is vested in the High Court, with appeal to the Supreme Court.

By Art. 323B of the Constitution, as inserted by the Constitution (42nd

The 42nd Amendment-setting up **Election** Tribunals.

Amendment) Act, 1976, power has been conferred on the appropriate Legislature to set up a Tribunal for the adjudication of disputes relating to elections of the Legislature concerned, by making law, and to provide in such law for the exclusion of all Courts (save that of

the Supreme Court under Art. 136), to entertain any such matter. In short, when any such law is made in exercise of this power, the High Court will cease to have any jurisdiction over election disputes; they will be determined only by the Administrative Tribunal set up by law, with appeal from the decision of such Tribunal to the Supreme Court by special leave under Art. 136.

Special Jurisdiction<br>for Election Disre. Presiputes dent, Vice- President, Prime Minister, Speaker.

In Art. 71 of the Constitution, the exclusive forum for adjudicating disputes relating to the election of the President and Vice-President is the Supreme Court. There is no special provision for the Prime Minister or the<br>Speaker of the House of the People, so that any dispute relating to election to these offices is to be determined only by an election petition before the

High Court, according to Art. 329(b).

Election Commission.

In order to supervise the entire procedure and machinery for election and for some other ancillary matters, the Constitution provides for an independent body, namely, the

Election Commission [Art. 324]. The provisions for the removal of the Election Commissioners make them independent of executive control and ensure an election free from the control of the party in power for the time being.

The Election Commission shall consist of a Chief Election Commissioner and such other Commissioners as the President may, from time to time, fix  $[Art. 324(2)].$

From the beginning the Election Commission consisted of the Chief Election Commissioner only. The Congress(I) Government just a week before the commencement of the 9th General Election appointed two more Commissioners on 16th October, 1989 making it a multi-member Commission (According to critics, the haste with which new Members were appointed created a suspicion that it was an attempt to compromise the independence of the Commission). The National Front Government, on assuming charge, amended the rules to make it again a single-member body w.e.f. 2nd January, 1990. The conditions of service and tenure of office of the Election Commissioner shall be such as Parliament may by law prescribe: Provided that the Chief Election Commissioner cannot be removed from his office except in like manner and on like grounds as a Judge of the Supreme Court. In other words, the Chief Election Commissioner can only be removed by each House of Parliament, by a special majority and on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity (and the other Election Commissioners shall not be removed by the President except on the recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner).

The Election Commission shall have the power of superintendence, direction and conduct of all elections to Parliament and the State Legislatures and of elections to the offices of the President and Vice-President [ $Art. 324(1)$ ].

Regional Commissioners may also be appointed by the President, in consultation with the Election Commission, on the eve of a general election to the House of the People or to the State Legislature, for assisting the Election Commission  $[Art. 324(4)].$ 

On 1-10-1993 the Government promulgated an Ordinance<sup>3</sup> (which was subsequently converted into an Act) to provide for the appointment of two Election Commissioners. Soon thereafter two Commissioners were appointed. The distribution of work and the rules for transaction of business made in the Ordinance were challenged in the Supreme Court. The Court issued directions and the matter has been finally settled by upholding the validity of the Act.<sup>4</sup>  $-1$ ducted will to good to
