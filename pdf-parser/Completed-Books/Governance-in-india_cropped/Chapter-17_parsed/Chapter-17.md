# **MAHATMA GANDHI NATIONAL RURAL EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEE ACT**

The Ministry of Rural Development is the nodal Ministry for implementing the *Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act* (*MGNREGA*). This flagship programme of the Government of India touches the lives of the rural poor and promotes inclusive growth.

#### **Objectives**

The MGNREGA with its legal framework and rights-based approach was notified in the year 2005. It aims at enhancing livelihood security by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The Act covered 200 districts in its first phase, and was extended to all the rural districts of the country in phases.

The MGNREGA is the first ever law, internationally, that guarantees wage employment at an unprecedented scale. The primary objective of the Act is meeting the demand for wage employment in rural areas. The works permitted under the Act address causes of chronic poverty like drought, deforestation and soil erosion, so that the employment generation is sustainable. The Act is also a significant vehicle for strengthening decentralisation and for deepening the processes of democracy by giving a pivotal role to local governance bodies, that is, the Panchayati Raj Institutions.

#### **Features**

The salient features of the Act are as follows:

- 1. **Rights-based Framework** For adult members of a rural household willing to do unskilled manual work.
- 2. **Time-bound Guarantee** Fifteen days for provision of employment, else unemployment allowance to be paid.
- 3. **Guaranteed Employment** Upto 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year per household, depending on the actual demand.
- 4. **Labour-intensive Works** 60 : 40 wage and material ratio for permissible works at the Gram Panchayat; no contractors/machinery.
- 5. **Decentralised Planning** In this context, the following points can be noted:

- (i) Gram Sabhas to recommend works
- (ii) At least 50% of works by Gram Panchayats for execution
- (iii) Principal role of PRIs in planning, implementation and monitoring
- 6. **Work-site facilities** Crèche, drinking water, first aid and shade provided at work sites.
- 7. **Women empowerment** At least one-third of beneficiaries should be women.
- 8. **Transparency and Accountability** Proactive disclosure through wall writings, citizen information boards and Management Information System (MIS) and Social Audits.
- 9. **Funding** Hundred per cent cost towards unskilled wages and 75% towards skilled, semiskilled and material is borne by the Central Government and 25% of skilled, semi-skilled and material costs is contributed by states. In addition, 6% administrative expenses are borne by the Centre for effective implementation of the Act.

# **Recent Initiatives**

Over the last few years, based on reports from the field and research inputs on implementation issues and challenges, the Ministry has taken the following initiatives to strengthen the programme implementation at grass-root level:

- 1. The Fourth edition of MGNREGA Operational Guidelines, 2013 was been released in February 2013. The revised guidelines have attempted to meet important implementation challenges, viz., accurate capturing of demand for the scheme, delays in wage payment, issues of transparency and accountability.
- 2. The list of permissible works under MGNREGA was expanded in May 2012 to:
  - (i) strengthen the synergy between MGNREGA and rural livelihoods, particularly agriculture, and create durable quality assets;
  - (ii) respond to the demands of states for greater location-specific flexibility in permissible works;
  - (iii) help improve the health and ecological situation in rural India, with particular focus on sanitation.
- 3. The contribution from MGNREGA for construction of individual toilets under Total Sanitation Campaign, now renamed as Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, has been increased to  $*4500$ from  $\sqrt{1200}$ .
- 4. Appointment of Ombudsman at district level for expeditious redressal of grievances on implementation of MGNREGA.
- 5. **Social Audits** The MGNREG Act requires that Gram Sabhas shall monitor the execution of works within the Gram Panchayat (GP). The Gram Sabha shall conduct regular social audits of all projects taken up under the scheme within the GP. Social Audit is not only a management tool but also a platform for public and primary stakeholders of MGNREGA to scrutinise the resources (both financial and non-financial) used for development initiatives. The MGNREGA Audit of Schemes Rules 2011 clearly provide that Social Audit Unit shall facilitate conduct of Social Audit of the works taken up under the Act in every GP at least once every six months in the manner prescribed under the rules.
- 6. **Grievance Redressal** To effectively address issues of concern on implementation of the MGNREGA and leakages in the Scheme, the Ministry has formulated the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for redressing complaints. This was realised during September 2012. The

new mechanism delineates procedures for managing various types of complaints that will streamline the redressal procedures.

- 7. **CAG Audit** Performance audit of MGNREGA by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is in progress and detailed report is expected soon.
- 8. **CA Audit at GP Level** The objective is to make certification of MGNREGA accounts at the GP level by chartered accountants compulsory over time, starting with 10% GPs in the identified highest spending district in each state in 2012–13.

# **New Guidelines**

The highlights of the Fourth Edition MGNREGA Operational Guidelines, 2013 are mentioned below:

- 1. Constitution of Cluster Facilitation Teams (CFTs), State Employment Guarantee Mission and Management Team and National Management Team.
- 2. Dedicated Programme Officers (PO): Blocks that have high concentration of SC/ST/landless labourers and are likely to have more demand for MGNREGA works should have a dedicated PO for MGNREGA. The dedicated PO should not be assigned responsibilities not directly related to MGNREGA.
- 3. Register applications for work through telephones including mobile phones and this should feed in directly into NREGASoft. Ensuring convenience to illiterate workers through Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) and voice-enabled interactions.
- 4. Network of Capacity Building Institutions for building the capacity of MGNREGA functionaries.
- 5. Baseline survey to assess quantum and timing of demand for work.
- 6. Habitation level as the unit of planning and identification of project.
- 7. Priority of works to be decided by Gram Panchayat in meetings of the Gram Sabha and the Ward Sabha.
- 8. The 60 : 40 ratio for wage and material costs should be maintained at GP level for all works to be taken up by GP and for works to be taken by all other agencies it should be maintained at the Block/Intermediate Panchayat level.

# **AAJEEVIKA (NATIONAL RURAL LIVELIHOODS MISSION)**

The Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) was launched in 1999 as an integrated programme for self-employment of the rural poor. Later, the SGSY has been restructured as National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM), subsequently renamed as "Aajeevika", to implement it in a mission mode across the country. The programme was formally launched in 2011.

The NRLM aims at reducing poverty by enabling poor households to access gainful selfemployment and skilled wage employment opportunities. This should result in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong and sustainable grassroots institutions of the poor.

The NRLM implementation is in a Mission Mode. This enables: (a) shift from the present allocation based strategy to a demand-driven strategy, enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans, (b) focus on targets, outcomes and time bound

delivery, (c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organised sector, and (d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes.

The salient features of NRLM (Aajeevika) are mentioned below:

- 1. **Universal Social Mobilisation** NRLM follows a saturation approach by ensuring that at least one woman member from each identified rural poor household is brought under the Self Help Group (SHG) network in a time-bound manner. Aajeevika ensures adequate coverage of vulnerable sections of the society such that 50% of the beneficiaries are SC/STs, 15% are minorities and 3% are persons with disability, while keeping in view the ultimate target of 100% coverage of BPL families.
- 2. **Promotion of Institutions of the Poor** Strong quality institutions of the poor such as SHGs and their federations are set up on priority. They empower the poor and acts as instruments of knowledge and technology dissemination, and hubs of production, collectivisation and commerce.
- 3. **Training, Capacity Building and Skill Building** Aajeevika ensures the poor are provided with the requisite skills for managing their institutions, linking up with markets, managing their existing livelihoods, enhancing their credit absorption capacity and credit worthiness. A multi-pronged approach is adopted for providing continuous capacity building of the targeted families, SHGs, their federations, government functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key stakeholders.
- 4. **Revolving Fund and Capital Subsidy** Subsidy is made available in the form of revolving fund and capital subsidy. Revolving Fund is provided to the SHGs (where more than 70% members are from BPL households) as an incentive to inculcate the habit of thrift and accumulate their own funds towards meeting their credit needs in the long run and immediate consumption needs in the short run.
- 5. **Universal Financial Inclusion** Aajeevika works on both demand and supply side of financial inclusion. On the demand side, it promotes financial literacy among the poor and provides catalytic capital to the SHGs and their federations. On the supply side, it coordinates with the financial sector and encourage use of Information, Communication & Technology (ICT) based financial technologies, business correspondents and community facilitators like 'Bank Mitras'.
- 6. **Provision of Interest Subsidy** To ensure affordable credit for the rural poor, Aajeevika has made a provision for subsidy on interest rate above 7% per annum for all eligible SHGs, who have availed loans from mainstream financial institutions, based on prompt loan repayment.
- 7. **Infrastructure Creation and Marketing Support** Aajeevika ensures that the infrastructure needs for the major livelihoods activities of the poor are met with. It also provides support for marketing to the institutions of the poor.
- 8. **Skills and Placement Projects** Scale up of existing skills and placement projects through partnership mode as one of the best investments in youth, and provide impetus to livelihoods opportunities in emerging markets. For strengthening this, various models of partnerships with public, private, non-government and community organisations would be developed.
- 9. **Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs)** Aajeevika encourages public sector banks to set up RSETIs in all districts of the country. RSETIs transform unemployed rural youth in the district into confident self-employed entrepreneurs through need-based

experiential training program followed by systematic handholding support and bank linkage.

- 10. **Funding Pattern** Aajeevika is a centrally sponsored scheme and the financing of the programme would be shared between the Centre and the states in the ratio of 75 : 25 (90 : 10 in case of north-eastern states including Sikkim; completely from the Centre in case of UTs).
- 11. **Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana** The Mahila Kisan Sashktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) was launched in 2010–11 as a sub component in Aajeevika, in order to improve the present status of women in agriculture and enhance the opportunities for empowerment. MKSP was initiated for livelihood enhancement and vulnerability reduction interventions across the country. MKSP recognises the centrality of women in agriculture and therefore aims to provide direct and indirect support to enable them to achieve sustainable agriculture production.
- 12. **Himayat** The Ministry of Rural Development is also implementing a new scheme under Aajeevika titled "Skill Empowerment and Employment in J&K" (see J&K) – "Himayat". This is a training-cum-placement programme developed and initiated by the Ministry of Rural Development as a special scheme to address the needs and aspirations of the unemployed youth in Jammu and Kashmir.

# **INDIRA AWAS YOJANA**

The Indira Awas Yogana (IAY) was launched in 1985 to meet the housing needs of the rural poor. The salient features of the scheme are as follows:

- 1. **Target Group** The IAY is a public housing scheme for the houseless poor families and those living in dilapidated and *kutcha* houses with a component for providing house sites to the landless poor as well. The scheme is designed to enable Below Poverty Line (BPL) households to build their houses or get house sites with financial and technical assistance from the government.
- 2. **Components of the Scheme** The IAY has the following three components:
  - (i) Assistance for construction of a new house
  - (ii) Upgradation of *kutcha* or dilapidated houses
  - (iii) Provision of house sites

Under IAY, with affect from 2013, a shelterless BPL family is given assistance of  $\approx 70,000$ in plain areas and  $\sqrt{5,000}$  in hilly/difficult areas/IAP (Integrated Action Plan) districts. Assistance for purchase of house sites has been fixed at  $\approx 20,000$ .

- 3. **Funding Pattern** The cost of the scheme except the component for provision of house sites is shared between Government of India and state governments in the ratio of 75 : 25. In the case of north-eastern states, the ratio is 90 : 10. The cost of providing house sites is shared 50 : 50 between Government of India and state governments. The Government of India provides the full cost in respect of Union Territories (UTs).
- 4. **Earmarking of Funds** At the national level, 60% of the funds are earmarked for SCs and STs with the proportion between SCs and STs being decided from time to time by the Ministry of Rural Development and reflected in the targets. Further, 15% of the funds are set apart for beneficiaries from among the minorities. The state should ensure that atleast 3% of beneficiaries are from among persons with disabilities.

5. **Allocation of Funds** Ninety-five per cent of the total budget is utilised for the components relating to new houses, upgradation of houses and provision of house sites and administrative expenses. The remaining 5% is reserved for special projects.

Allocation to states/UTs and from States/UTs to districts, blocks and wherever the states so desire, to the village Panchayats is on the basis of houseless people from among the BPL population for each category, i.e., SC, ST, minorities and others.

The Ministry has fixed the annual allocation for the States/UTs on the basis of 75% weightage to housing shortage in rural areas and 25% weightage to the number of people BPL. Within this overall target, allocation of funds for SCs, STs and Minorities is made on the basis of the proportionate population of these categories in the States/UTs.

- 6. **Special Projects** Five per cent of IAY allocation is retained at the central level as reserve fund. Special Projects for utilising the reserve fund can be posed by the States/UTs for the following purposes:
  - (i) Rehabilitation of BPL families affected by natural calamities.
  - (ii) Rehabilitation of BPL families affected by violence and law and order problems.
  - (iii) Settlement of freed, bonded labourers and liberated, manual scavengers.
  - (iv) Settlement of particularly vulnerable tribal groups.
  - (v) New technology demonstration especially with focus on affordable and green technologies.
- 7. **Administrative Expenses** Upto 4% of the funds released can be utilised for administering the scheme, of which upto 0.5% can be retained at the state level and the balance can be distributed to the districts. The district allocation includes two parts, one part to meet fixed expenditure which is same for all districts in a state and the other part proportional to the targets allotted to the district in order to meet working expenses. The states may decide the formula and also the formula for distribution to the intermediate and Village Panchayat levels in accordance with workload assigned to them.
- 8. **Agency for Implementation** At the district level the implementation is entrusted to Zilla Parishad or its equivalent in states where there are no Zilla Parishads.

At the local level, the Village Panchayat, or its equivalent where the state has no Village Panchayats, implements the programme. If Village Panchayats are too small to implement the scheme, the state may entrust the task to the Panchayat at the intermediate level. In such cases, Village Panchayats are given clear roles in selection of habitats and beneficiaries and in supervision and monitoring.

9. **Selection of Beneficiaries** The Gram Sabha selects the beneficiaries from the list of eligible BPL households/Permanent IAY Waitlist wherever it has been prepared.

In order to introduce transparency in selection of beneficiaries, permanent IAY waitlists have to be prepared gram panchayat wise. These lists contain the name of deserving BPL families who need IAY houses in order of their poverty status based on the BPL list 2002.

Construction of an IAY house is the responsibility of the beneficiary. Engagement of contractors is prohibited and no specific type, design has been stipulated for an IAY house. However, sanitary latrine and smokeless *chullah* are required to be constructed along with each IAY house. For construction of the sanitary latrine, the beneficiary can avail of the existing assistance from the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC).

10. **Women Empowerment** The basic parameter of the scheme aims for gender equality and empowerment. However, under the scheme no separate funds are earmarked for women. As

per scheme guidelines, houses constructed are to be allotted in the name of female member of the beneficiary household. Alternatively, it can be allotted in the name of both husband and wife under the programme. When there is no eligible female member in the family available/alive, IAY house is allotted to the male members of a deserving BPL family.

- 11. **Homestead Scheme** The scheme was launched in 2009 as part of IAY, for providing homestead sites to those rural BPL households whose names are included in the Permanent IAY Waitlists but who do not have house site.
- 12. **Convergence** Necessary instructions have been issued to all the DRDAs regarding convergence of various Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) with IAY. IAY beneficiaries can get benefits under Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY), Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC), Janshree and Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana and Differential Rate of Interest (DRI) Scheme.

# **PRADHAN MANTRI GRAM SADAK YOJANA**

The Government of India, as the part of poverty-reduction strategy, launched the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) in 2000 as a CSS to assist states, though rural roads are in the state list under the Constitution.

The primary objective of the programme is to provide good all-weather connectivity to all eligible unconnected habitations in the core network with a population of 500 (Census-2001) and above. In respect of the Hill States, Desert areas, Tribal Areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts under Integrated Action Plan, the objective is to connect habitations with a population of 250 (Census-2001) and above. The programme envisages single all-weather connectivity.

With a view to ensuring full farm-to-market connectivity, the programme also provides for the upgradation of the existing Through Routes and Major Rural Links to prescribed standards, though it is not central to the programme.

The salient features of PMGSY are mentioned below:

- 1. **Decentralised Planning** The Programme draws upon the model of decentralised network planning for rural roads. The District Rural Roads Plans (DRRPs) have been developed for all the districts of the country and Core Network has been drawn out of the DRRP to provide for at least a single connectivity to each target habitation.
- 2. **Standards and Specifications** A Manual on Geometric Standards, Design, Construction and Maintenance of Rural Roads was published by the Indian Roads Congress at the special intervention of the Ministry of Rural Development.
- 3. **Detailed Project Reports and Scrutiny** As an important step to achieve quality output for each road under the Programme, proper survey and adequate investigations are stipulated. A Detailed Project Report (DPR) is a pre-requisite for project clearance. Independent scrutiny of the project proposals to ensure the adequacy of designing and project preparation is carried out.
- 4. **Institutional Arrangements** The Ministry of Rural Development is the nodal Ministry for implementation of the Programme at Central level. National Rural Roads Development Agency (NRRDA) has been constituted to provide technical and managerial support for implementation of the programme at the central level. The state governments have identified

State Nodal Departments and State Rural Roads Development Agencies (SRRDAs) have been constituted for the programme implementation at the state level. Depending upon the work load, Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are constituted for each district by the states.

- 5. **Procurement Process** Based on best National and International practices, a Standard Bidding Document (SBD) has been developed for procurement of works under the PMGSY. All the works under the Programme are being procured and managed on the basis of provisions of the SBD. To ensure transparency and harness various advantages of electronic tendering, entire bidding for procurement of works under the programme is being carried out only through eprocurement.
- 6. **Quality Assurance** Quality is the essence of this programme, as such, a three-tier Quality Management Mechanism has been institutionalised under PMGSY.
- 7. **Maintenance** With a view to ensure sustainability of road assets created under the programme, each contract under the programme provides for defect liability of five years along with paid routine maintenance after completion of the work by the same contractor.
- 8. **Online Monitoring, Management and Accounting System** In view of full transparency in various aspects of programme implementation, a web-based Online Monitoring, Management and Accounting System (OMMAS) has been developed for the programme.
- 9. **Operations Manual and Programme Monitoring** All the operations under the programme have been systematically laid down in the "Operations Manual". This manual provides for details of all the processes encompassing Institutional Structures, Planning, Design, Project Preparation, Procurement, Quality, Technical Agencies, Monitoring, Management of Maintenance, Road Safety, etc.

# **NATIONAL SOCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME**

The Directive Principles of State Policy in the Constitution of India enjoin upon the state to undertake within its means a number of welfare measures. In particular, Article 41 of the Constitution of India directs the state to provide public assistance to its citizens in case of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement and in other cases of undeserved want within the limit of its economic capacity and development. It is in accordance with these noble principles that the Government of India launched the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) in 1995.

The NSAP then comprised National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS), National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS) and National Maternity Benefit Scheme (NMBS). These programmes were meant for providing social assistance benefit to the aged, the BPLhouseholds in the case of death of the primary breadwinner and for maternity. These programmes were aimed at ensuring minimum national standards in addition to the benefits that the states were then providing or would provide in future.

The NMBS was transferred to Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 2001 and subsumed in Janani Suraksha Yojana. In 2000, a new scheme known as Annapurna Scheme was launched. In 2009, two new schemes, namely, Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme (IGNWPS) and Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS) have been introduced under NSAP.

Therefore, at present (2014), the NSAP comprises the following five schemes:

1. **Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS)** The Government of India in the year 2007 modified the eligibility criteria for grant of old age pension to persons aged 65

years or higher and belonging to a household below the poverty line. With this modification the National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS) was renamed as Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS).

Under IGNOAPS, since 2007, old age pension of  $\epsilon$  200 per month was being provided to persons of 65 years and above.

In the year 2011, under IGNOAPS, the eligibility for old age pension has been reduced from 65 years to 60 years and the amount of pension has been raised from  $\approx 200$  to  $\approx 500$  per month for those who are 80 years or above.

Hence, under the IGNOAPS scheme, the BPL persons in the age group of  $60-79$  years are entitled to a monthly pension of 200 and BPL persons of age of 80 years and above are entitled to a monthly pension of  $\epsilon$ 500

2. **Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme (IGNWPS)** In the year 2009, the GOI has approved pension to BPL widows in the age group of 40–64 years  $\omega$  -200 p.m. per beneficiary. Consequent upon the lowering of age under IGNOAPS, the upper age limit under IGNWPS has been lowered from 64 years to 59 years.

In the year 2012, the amount of pension under IGNWPS has been increased to  $\approx 300$  p.m. and upper age limit has been increased to 79 years. Hence, IGNWPS is applicable to widows in the age group of 40–79 years and belonging to household living below poverty line.

3. **Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS)** In 2009, the GOI has also approved pension under Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS) for BPL persons with severe or multiple disabilities between the age group of 18–64 years  $\omega$ . 200 p.m. per beneficiary. Consequent upon the lowering of age under IGNOAPS, the upper age limit under IGNDPS has been lowered from 64 years to 59 years.

In the year 2012, the amount of pension under IGNDPS has been increased to  $\approx 300$  p.m. and upper age limit has been increased to 79 years. Hence, IGNDPS is applicable to persons with severe or multiple disabilities between the age group of 18-79 years and belonging to household living below poverty line.

4. **National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS)** At inception, grant of 5000 in case of death due to natural causes and  $\neq 10,000$  in case of accidental death of the "primary breadwinner" was provided to the bereaved household under this scheme. The primary breadwinner specified in the scheme, whether male or female, had to be a member of the household whose earning contributed substantially to the total household income. The death of such a primary breadwinner occurring whilst he or she was in the age group of 18 to 64 years, i.e., more than 18 years of age and less than 65 years of age, made the family eligible to receive grants under the scheme.

In 1998, the amount of benefit under NFBS was raised to  $\neq 10,000$  in case of death due to natural causes as well as accidental causes.

In the year 2012, the amount of assistance under NFBS has been increased to  $\approx 20,000$  and upper age limit of death of primary breadwinner has been reduced to 59 years. Hence, NFBS is applicable in case of death of primary breadwinner in the age group of 18-59 years.

5. **Annapurna Scheme** This scheme is aimed at providing food security to meet the requirement of those senior citizens who, though eligible had remained uncovered under the IGNOAPS. Under the scheme, 10 kg of food grains per month is provided free of cost to the beneficiary.

# **NATIONAL LAND RECORDS MODERNISATION PROGRAMME**

The National Land Records Modernisation Programme (NLRMP) was launched in 2008. The NLRMP was formed by the merger of two pre-existing centrally sponsored schemes, viz., Strengthening of Revenue Administration and Updating of Land Records (started in 1987–88) and Computerisation of Land Records (launched in 1988–89).

#### **Components**

The main objective of the NLRMP is to modernise the land records system in the country and to build up an integrated land information management system with up-to-date and real time land records. For this purpose, the two main systems of land records management and registration are to be integrated with the help of modern technology. Accordingly, the following activities are being supported under the programme:

- 1. completion of computerisation of the records of rights (RoRs).
- 2. digitisation of maps and integration of textual and spatial data.
- 3. survey/resurvey using modern technology including aerial photogrammetry.
- 4. computerisation of registration.
- 5. automatic generation of mutation notices.
- 6. vertical linking of revenue offices and connectivity amongst the land records and registration offices.
- 7. modern record rooms/land records management centres at tehsil/taluk/circle/block level.
- 8. training and capacity building of the concerned officials and functionaries.

# **Funding Pattern**

The NLRMP is being implemented as a centrally sponsored scheme with the following funding pattern for its various components:

- (i) Computerisation of land records including digitisation of cadastral maps, integration of textual and spatial data, data centres at tehsil, sub-division, district and state level, interconnectivity among revenue offices (100% by Government of India).
- (ii) Survey/resurvey and updating of the survey & settlement records (including ground control network and ground truthing) using modern technology options. (90% and 50% by Govt. of India for NE states and other states respectively).
- (iii) Computerisation of Registration including connectivity to SROs with revenue offices (90% and 25% by Govt. of India for NE states and other states respectively).
- (iv) Modern record rooms/land records management centres at tehsil level (90% and 50% by Govt. of India for NE states and other states respectively).
- (v) Training & capacity building (100% by Govt. of India)
- (vi) Core GIS (100% by Govt. of India)
### **Significance**

A major focus of the NLRMP is on citizen services, such as providing computerised copies of the records of rights (RoRs) with maps; other landbased certificates such as caste certificates, income certificates, domicile certificates; information for eligibility for development programmes etc. Property owners are accessed to their land records, as records are placed on the websites with proper security IDs. Abolition of stamp papers and payment of stamp duty and registration fees through banks, e-linkages to credit facilities, automatic and automated mutations and single-window service can be achieved under the programme.

Further, the NLRMP is of immense usefulness to the governments—both Central and state governments—in modernising and bringing efficiency to the land revenue administration as well as offering a comprehensive tool for planning various land-based developmental, regulatory and disaster management activities needing location-specific information.

The ultimate goal of the NLRMP is to usher in the system of conclusive titling, to replace the current system of presumptive titles in the country. The activities to be undertaken under the programme are to converge in the district and district is the unit of implementation. All the districts in the country are expected to be covered under the programme by the end of the Twelfth Plan.

### **INTEGRATED WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME**

#### **Area Development Programmes**

The Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) was launched in 2009. The IWMP was formed by the merger of three pre-existing Area Development Programmes, viz.,

- (i) Draught Prone Areas Programme (DPAP)
- (ii) Desert Development Programme (DDP)
- (iii) Integrated Wastelands Development Programme (IWDP)

The DPAP was launched in 1973–74 to tackle the special problems of areas constantly affected by severe drought condition. The DDP was launched in 1977–78 for hot desert areas of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and cold desert areas of Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. In 1995–96, the coverage of DDP was extended to six districts of Karnataka and one district of Andhra Pradesh. The IWDP was launched in 1989 for development of wastelands on watershed basis. The guidelines for these three programmes were revised in 2003 and renamed as Hariyali Guidelines.

### **Objectives**

The consolidation of the above three separate programmes into a single IWMP is for optimum use of resources, sustainable outcomes and integrated planning. The main objectives of the IWMP are to restore the ecological balance by harnessing, conserving and developing degraded natural resources such as soil, vegetative cover and water. The outcomes are prevention of soil erosion, regeneration of natural vegetation, rain water harvesting and recharging of the ground water table. This enables multicropping and the introduction of diverse agro-based activities, which help to provide sustainable livelihoods to the people residing in the watershed area.

### **Features**

The salient features of IWMP are mentioned below:

- 1. The activities to be taken up under IWMP are spread over three phases. The Preparatory Phase (one to two years) mainly involves preparation of DPR, Entry Point Activities and Institution & Capacity Building. The Watershed Works Phase (two to three years) involves the Watershed Development Works, Livelihood Activities for the assetless persons and Production System & Micro Enterprises. The Consolidation and Withdrawal Phase (one to two years) involves consolidation and completion of various works.
- 2. The cost norm for IWMP is  $\neq 15000$  per ha for hilly & difficult areas,  $\neq 12000$  per ha for other areas and upto  $\neq 15000$  per ha for IWMP projects in Integrated Action Plan (IAP) Districts.
- 3. The funding pattern under the scheme is in the ratio of 90 : 10 between the Centre and the states.
- 4. The projects under IWMP undertake a cluster of micro-watersheds of area about 5000 ha in rainfed/degraded areas having no assured irrigation.
- 5. The programme lays emphasis on meticulous planning and capacity building, by providing a special provision of 1% for preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) and 5% for Institution and Capacity Building.
- 6. Nine per cent of the project cost is earmarked for development of sustainable livelihood options for assetless people whereas 10% of the project cost is dedicated for productivity enhancement and development of microenterprises for small and marginal farmers.
- 7. The programme emphasises utilising the information technology, remote sensing techniques, GIS facilities, with spatial and non-spatial data, into planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the projects.

### **TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXTENSION TRAINING SCHEME**

The Technology Development Extension Training (TDET) scheme was launched in 1993 to promote the development of cost-effective and proven technologies for reclamation of various categories of wasteland.

### **Objectives**

The main objectives of the scheme include:

- 1. To undertake package of activities which would comprise of the Innovative Technology Development Pilot and Action Research Projects, Replicable Demonstration Models, Extension and Training with clearly defined objectives to address the contemporary problems in watershed management at the planning, implementation, monitoring and post-project utilisation stages.
- 2. To use modern technology on crop simulation models to estimate true potential of rainfed agriculture by integrated watershed management.

- 3. To assess the Productivity/Yield Gap between the laboratory and field conditions coupled with technology development and extension to bridge this gap.
- 4. To contribute immensely in assessing the actual impact of various activities in watershed development programmes in terms of changes in Geo-hydrological potential, soil and crop cover, run off, etc. in the project area.

#### **Features**

The features of this scheme are:

- (a) The scheme is being implemented through ICAR institutes, State Agricultural Universities, District Rural Development Agencies and Government Institutions with adequate institutional framework and organisational back up. Successful implementation of the scheme is expected to bridge the gap between existing technologies relevant to the latest situation for development of non-forest wasteland and wider application by organisations and agencies dealing with land-based programme.
- (b) Under the scheme, 100% grant is admissible to implement projects on wastelands owned by government, public sector undertakings, universities, panchayats, etc. In case, projects include the development of wastelands of private farmers and corporate bodies, the project cost is to be shared 60 : 40 between government and beneficiaries. However, in case of the land belonging to small and marginal farmers, the beneficiary share will be 10% and 5% respectively.
- (c) Before a project is sanctioned, it is scrutinised by the Technical Advisory Committee and after its recommendation, it is placed before the Steering Committee for final approval.

# **Activities**

The important activities undertaken under TDET scheme are:

- (i) Development of a data base on wastelands.
- (ii) Promotion and testing of various agro-forestry models in different agro-climatic zones of the country.
- (iii) Cost-effective technologies for increasing the productivity of saline and alkaline soils.
- (iv) Promotion of medicinal and herbal plantations of non-forest wastelands.
- (v) Composite technologies for water harvesting.
- (vi) Treatment of degraded lands through bio-fertilisers (vermiculture, mycorrhisa, biopesticides).
- (vii) Food stock modes techniques and development of technology for Jojoba plantation in arid and semiarid areas.
- (viii) Low-cost technology to convert domestic and farm waste into Bio-fertiliser for use to grow fruit trees.

# **NATIONAL RURAL DRINKING WATER PROGRAMME**

# **Background**

The Government of India's major intervention in water sector started in 1972 through the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme (ARWSP) for assisting States/UTs to accelerate the coverage of drinking water supply in 'problem villages'. A Technology Mission with stress on water quality, appropriate technology intervention, human resource development support and other related activities was introduced in 1986 which was subsequently renamed as the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission (RGNDWM) in the year 1991. In the year 1999, Sector Reform Projects was started to involve the community in planning, implementation and management of drinking water schemes which, in 2002, was scaled up as the Swajaldhara programme. The programme was revised in 2009 and named the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP).

# **Objectives**

The NRDWP is a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at providing adequate and safe drinking water to the rural population of the country. The objectives of the programme are as follows :

- 1. Provision of safe and adequate drinking water supply to all uncovered, partially covered and quality affected habitations in the rural areas of the country.
- 2. Provision of water supply in government schools and *anganwadis*.
- 3. Moving from habitation level coverage towards household level drinking water security and coverage.
- 4. Moving away from over dependence on single drinking water source to multiple sources through conjunctive use of surface water, ground water and rainwater harvesting.
- 5. Ensuring sustain ability in drinking water supply schemes, water budgeting and preparation of village water security plans.
- 6. Convergence with NBA, NRHM, ICDS, SSA, MNREGS, Watershed Development programme etc.
- 7. Giving flexibility to states to adopt better service norms for determining coverage.
- 8. Incentivising states to hand over management of rural water supply schemes to panchayats.
- 9. Providing earmarked funds for support activities like IEC, HRD, MIS, R & D, STA in NRDWP and providing 5% allocation in NRDWP funds.

# **New Features**

During 2010 to 2013, the following new features were included in the Programme :

- (i) Focus on piped water supply rather than on handpumps.
- (ii) Enhancement of service levels for rural water supply from the norm of 40 lpcd to 55 lpcd for designing of systems.
- (iii) Prioritisation of states which are lagging in terms of coverage with piped water supply.
- (iv) Focus on states with Integrated Action Plan (IAP) districts.
- (v) Making available additional resources for operation and management of schemes.
- (vi) Conjoint approach between rural water supply and rural sanitation so as to achieve saturation of habitations with both these services.
- (vii) Participative planning and implementation of water resource management practices.
- (viii) Incentivising states to hand over management of schemes to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) by introducing Management Devolution Index (MDI) consisting of 21 Indicators which would

be independently evaluated.

- $(ix)$ A new component of Water Quality Monitoring and Surveillance was introduced with 3% of NRDWP funds allocated for the purpose.
- (x) A dedicated fund consisting of 5% of the total allocation of NRDWP funds to states have been earmarked for states with habitations having chemical contamination and states with high priority districts affected by Japanese Encephalitis (JE) / Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES).

#### **Components**

The programme has different components to meet the emerging challenges in the rural drinking water sector. The allocation for different components and their funding pattern is mentioned in [Table](#page-15-0) 17.2.

In order to develop the understanding and appreciation of safe and clean drinking water amongst rural communities and to enable them to carry out tests to determine the quality of drinking water, the National Rural Drinking Water Quality Monitoring and Surveillance Programme (NRDWQM & SP) was launched in 2006. In the year 2009, the programme has been subsumed in the NRDWP.

#### **Jalmani Programme**

With the objective of providing safe and clean drinking water to the children studying in water deficient rural schools, the Jalmani Programme was launched in 2008. Under the programme, 100% financial assistance is provided to states to install standalone water purification system in rural schools. The states were given the flexibility to select the appropriate technology and product.

### **NIRMAL BHARAT ABHIYAN**

#### **Background**

The Government of India started the Central Rural Sanitation Programme (CRSP) in 1986 primarily with the objective of improving the quality of life of the rural people and also to provide privacy and dignity to women.

The concept of sanitation was expanded to include personal hygiene, home sanitation, safe water, garbage disposal, excreta disposal and waste water disposal. With this broader concept of sanitation, the CRSP adopted a "demand driven" approach with the name "Total Sanitation Campaign" (TSC) in 1999.

In 2012, the TSC was renamed as "Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan" (NBA). The objective of NBA is to achieve sustainable behaviour change with provision of sanitary facilities in entire communities in a phased, saturation mode with "Nirmal Grams" as outcomes. The new strategy is to transform rural India into 'Nirmal Bharat' by adopting community saturation approach. The NBA goal is to achieve 100% access to sanitation for all rural households by 2022.

A Nirmal Bharat is the dream of a clean and healthy nation that thrives and contributes to the wellbeing of our people by completely eliminating the traditional habit of open and operationalising systems for the safe management of solid and liquid waste at scale, along with improved hygiene behaviours.

### **Objectives**

The main objectives of the NBA are as under:

- 1. To bring about an improvement in the general quality of life in the rural areas.
- 2. To accelerate sanitation coverage in rural areas to achieve the vision of Nirmal Bharat by 2022 with all gram Panchayats in the country attaining Nirmal status.
- 3. To motivate communities and Panchayati Raj Institutions promoting sustainable sanitation facilities through awareness creation and health education.
- 4. To cover the remaining schools not covered under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Anganwadi Centres in the rural areas with proper sanitation facilities and undertake proactive

promotion of hygiene education and sanitary habits among students.

- 5. To encourage cost effective and appropriate technologies for ecologically safe and sustainable sanitation.
- 6. To develop community managed environmental sanitation systems focusing on solid and liquid waste management for overall cleanliness in the rural areas.

# **New Initiatives**

Under NBA, the following new initiatives have been undertaken:

- 1. Conjoint approach with the scheme of National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) has been adopted to address the issue of availability of water in the Gram Panchayats for sustaining sanitation facilities created.
- 2. More focus on Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities with that lays the basis for successful implementation of the programme.
- 3. Convergence with other Ministry/State Departments like Health, Women & Child Development and Panchayati Raj is being focused upon.
- 4. Provision has been made for incentivising Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Anganwadi workers for promoting sanitation. Self Help Groups, Women's Groups and Non-Government Organisations of repute are to be encouraged by states to participate in sanitation promotion.

# **Provisions**

The various provisions under the NBA are mentioned below :

- 1. Under NBA, the provision of incentive for individual household latrine units has been widened to cover all APL households who belong to SCs, STs, small and marginal farmers, landless labourers with homesteads, physically challenged and women headed households along-with all BPL households.
- 2. Provision of individual household latrines: Incentive of 3200 and 1400 for each toilet ( $\epsilon$  $3700$  and  $\neq 1400$  in case of hilly and difficult areas) is given by Central and state governments respectively to BPL households and identified Above Poverty Line (APL) households.
- 3. In addition, upto 4500 to be booked under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for construction of the toilet is permitted.
- 4. Assistance of 35000 ( $\overline{38500}$  for hilly and difficult areas) for toilets in schools and  $\overline{8000}$  ( $\overline{38000}$ 10000 for hilly and difficult areas) for Anganwadi Toilets with the cost shared by Central and states government in the ratio of 70 : 30.
- 5. Provision for upto 200000 for construction of Community Sanitary Complexes with cost shared between Centre, state and community in the ratio of 60 : 30 : 10.
- 6. Assistance to production centres of sanitary materials and rural sanitary marts.
- 7. Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) in project mode for each Gram Panchayat (GP) with financial assistance capped for a GP based on number of households to enable all Panchayats to implement sustainable SLWM projects. A cap of  $\sqrt{7/12/15/20}$  lakh to be applicable for Gram Panchayats having up to 150/300/500/ more than 500 households on a Centre and State/GP sharing ratio of 70 : 30. Projects to be prioritised in identified GPs

targeted for Nirmal status and those that have already been awarded Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP). Any additional cost requirement is to be met from the State/GP.

8. Funds for capacity building of all stakeholders including Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and field level implementers have been earmarked under the revised strategy.

#### **Nirmal Gram Puraskar**

The Government of India (GOI) launched an award based Incentive Scheme for fully sanitised and open defecation-free Gram Panchayats, Blocks, Districts and States called "Nirmal Gram Puraskar" (NGP) in 2003 and started awarding GPs in 2005 as a component of its flagship scheme Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC). The NGP seeks to recognise the efforts made by Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and organisations which have contributed significantly towards ensuring full sanitation coverage in their areas of operation.

The main objectives of NGP are:

- 1. To promote safe sanitation and clean environment as a way of life in rural India.
- 2. To incentivise Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) to make the villages Open Defecation Free (ODF) and to adopt Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM).
- 3. To sustain the initiative of clean environment.
- 4. To encourage organisations to play a catalytic role in social mobilisation in the implementation of NBA.

In 2008, Sikkim became the first Nirmal State (no open defecation state) of the country.

### **PROVISION OF URBAN AMENITIES IN RURAL AREAS SCHEME**

#### **Rationale**

The Provision of Urban amenities in Rural Areas (PURA) scheme proposes holistic and accelerated development of compact areas around a potential growth centre in a Gram Panchayat (or a group of Gram Panchayats) through Public Private Partnership (PPP) framework. The primary objectives of the scheme are the provision of livelihood opportunities and urban amenities in rural areas to bridge the rural–urban divide and to improve the quality of life in rural areas. The scheme is being implemented on pilot basis.

Lack of livelihood opportunities, modern amenities and services for decent living in rural areas lead to migration of people to urban areas. There are wide gaps in the availability of physical and social infrastructure between rural and urban areas. To address these issues, in the year 2003, the then President of India Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had enunciated the idea of integrated development of villages leading to urbanisation through a mission for Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA). Dr. Kalam visualised providing four connectivities: physical connectivity, electronic connectivity, knowledge connectivity leading to economic connectivity of rural areas.

#### **PURA and PURA 1.0**

Subsequently, PURA was implemented as a pilot scheme during the Tenth Five Year Plan in Basmath (Maharashtra), Bharthana (Uttar Pradesh), Gohpur (Assam), Kujanga (Orissa), Motipur (Bihar), Rayadurg (Andhra Pradesh) and Shahpura (Rajasthan). An evaluation study of these pilot projects by National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD) revealed that the scheme was open-ended without specific guidelines and had no in-built business plan. Besides, it was largely infrastructure-centric without factoring lead economic activities and the site selection was not based on growth potential. It did not allow for convergence with other schemes of rural development or other departments, hence having limited impact on holistic development of rural areas.

Based on the findings of the evaluation study by NIRD, comments of various Ministries/Departments, feedback received during consultations with private sector representatives and officials of state governments, and the recommendations of the consulting team of Asian Development Bank (ADB), the scheme was totally restructured as PURA 1.0 for implementation on pilot basis during Eleventh Five Year Plan as a central sector scheme. The salient features of the restructured PURA 1.0 included the following :

- 1. Convergence of Central and state government schemes.
- 2. Implementation in project mode and based on lifecycle cost approach that allows bundling of construction and O&M of infrastructure and amenities.
- 3. Implementation through a single private partner to ensure simultaneous delivery of key infrastructure required in villages leading to optimal use of resources.
- 4. Site selection by private partner on basis of socio-economic growth considerations.
- 5. Agreement between Gram Panchayat and the private partner that makes the restructured PURA a model for empowerment of Gram Panchayats and public accountability.

The Working Group for PURA 1.0 constituted by Planning Commission has recommended that PURA 1.0 be upscaled as a full-fledged scheme during the Twelfth Five Year Plan and implemented all over the country.

# **PURA 2.0 (PURA Phase II)**

Accordingly, in 2012, the Ministry of Rural Development has launched PURA Phase II (PURA 2.0) as a central sector scheme which is implemented through a Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement amongst Central Government, state government, Gram Panchayat(s) and the private sector. The rollout of projects is supported by Planning Commission, Department of Economic Affairs and Asian Development Bank.

The redesigned PURA 2.0 is a unique blend of infrastructure provisioning, economic activity, skill development and livelihood generation. It is an effort to provide a different framework for the implementation of rural infrastructure development schemes and harness private sector efficiencies in the management of assets and delivery of services.

The scope of the scheme is to select private partners to develop livelihood opportunities, urban amenities and infrastructure facilities to prescribed service levels almost akin to urban standards and to be responsible for maintenance of the same for a period of ten years in identified Panchayats/cluster of Panchayats. Private sector entities having experience in development and management of community-oriented infrastructure projects are selected through an open competitive bidding process based on rigorous qualifications and evaluation criteria.

The selected private partners are required to provide standard amenities like water supply and sewerage, roads, drainage, solid waste management, street lighting and power distribution and
undertake some economic and skill development activity as part of the PURA project. The private partners may also provide 'add-on' revenue-earning facilities such as village linked tourism, integrated rural hub, rural market, agri-common services centre and warehousing, etc. in addition to the above-mentioned amenities. Where the PURA project spans several Panchayats in a cluster, the private partner would propose sub-projects with the PURA elements for each of the Panchayats.

The leveraging of public funds with private capital and management expertise for creation and maintenance of rural infrastructure is the essence of the PURA scheme. Further, the scheme is envisioned to act as the catalyst not only for convergence between different infrastructure development schemes but also for the new model for the management of urbanisation of rural areas.

## **RAJIV GANDHI PANCHAYAT SASHAKTIKARAN ABHIYAN**

The Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA) was launched in the year 2013 to strengthen the Panchayati Raj System across the country and address critical gaps that constrain it.

The funding of RGPSA for State plans is on a 75 : 25 sharing basis by the Central and State Governments respectively. For NE States, the ratio is 90 : 10. The schemes of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Yojana (RGSY), e-Panchayat, Panchayat Empowerment and Accountability Incentive Scheme (PEAIS) and Panchayat Mahila Evam Yuva Shakti Abhiyan (PMEYSA) are subsumed in RGPSA from 2013–14.

## **Objectives**

The RGPSA seeks to:

- 1. Enhance capacities and effectiveness of Panchayats and the Gram Sabhas;
- 2. Enable democratic decision-making and accountability in Panchayats and promote people's participation;
- 3. Strengthen the institutional structure for knowledge creation and capacity building of Panchayats;
- 4. Promote devolution of powers and responsibilities to Panchayats according to the spirit of the Constitution and PESA Act;
- 5. Strengthen Gram Sabhas to function effectively as the basis forum of people's participation, transparency and accountability within the Panchayat system;
- 6. Create and strengthen democratic local self-government in areas where Panchayats do not exist; and
- 7. Strrengthen the constitutionally mandated framework on which Panchayats are founded.

#### **Scheme Modalities**

As the status of Panchayats varies across States, the States need to undertake different activities to strengthen their Panchayati Raj systems with reference to their specific requirements and context. The RGPSA allows a range of activities to be undertaken by states as per state needs, so that each state can bring about needed changes to strengthen its Panchayati Raj system.

To access funds, the states need to prepare perspective plans for five years, i.e., the Twelfth Plan period, and annual plans for strengthening Panchayats, detailing out the activities and deliverables, from among the permitted components in the scheme.

The states are required to fulfill some essential conditions for accessing any RGPSA funds. These include :

- 1. Regular elections to Panchayats or local bodies in non-Part IX areas under the superintendence and control of the State Election Commission (SEC).
- 2. Atleast one-third reservation for women in Panchayats or other local bodies.
- 3. Constitution of SFC every five years, and placement of Action Taken Report on the recommendations of the SFC in the state legtislature.
- 4. Constitution of District Planning Committees (DPCs) in all districts, and issuing of guidelines/rules to make these functional.

The states that do not fulfill the above essential conditions are not eligible for funds under RGPSA. Further, twenty per cent scheme funds are linked to action taken by the states for implementation of the provisions of the 73<sup>rd</sup> Amendment to the Constitution of India in the following areas :

- 1. Articulating an appropriate policy framework for providing administrative and technical support to Panchayats.
- 2. Strengthening the financial base of Panchayats by assigning appropriate taxes, fees, etc.
- 3. Provision of united funds to Panchayats and timely release of SFC and Central Finance Commission (CFC) grants.
- 4. Ensuring devolution of funds, functions and functionaries.
- 5. Preparing and operationalising a framework for bottom-up grassroots planning and convergence through the DPC.
- 6. Ensuring free and fair elections, and making the SEC autonomous.
- 7. Strengthening the institutional structure for capacity building of Panchayats, selecting suitable partners for capacity building, and improving outreach and quality of capacity building.
- 8. Putting in place a system of performance assessment of Panchayats.
- 9. Strengthening Gram Sabhas, promoting Mahila Sabhas/Ward Sabhas.
- 10. Institutionalising accountability processes such as voluntary disclosure of information and social audit.
- 11. Strengthening the system of budgeting, accounts and audit, including use of e-enabled processes. Maintenance of Panchayat accounts on-line at least for District and Intermediate Panchayats. Issuing of guidelines/rules for voluntary disclosure of budget and accounts by Panchayats.
- 12. Ensuring compliance of state laws and rules with PESA.

## **Activities to be Included in State Plans**

The states are expected to prepare plans under the scheme to undertake activities as per their requirement / priorities, from a menu of activities permitted in the scheme. Each state is not expected to necessarily undertake all the activities. Activities that can be included in state plans under RGPSA are as follows:

- 1. Administrative and technical support at the Gram Panchayat (GP) level.
- 2. GP buildings.
- 3. Capacity building and training of elected representatives & functionaries.

- 4. Institutional structure for training at state, district & block level.
- 5. E-enablement of panchayats.
- 6. Support to Panchayat processes and procedures in Panchayats with inadequate revenue base.
- 7. Special support for Gram Sabhas in PESA and NE areas.
- 8. Programme management.
- 9. Information, Education, Communication (IEC).
- 10. Strengthening of SECs.
- 11. Innovative activities in states.

# **PRADHAN MANTRI ADARSH GRAM YOJANA**

The Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of the Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY) was launched in the year 2010 as a pilot scheme for integrated development of 1,000 selected Scheduled Caste (SC) majority villages. The scheme is presently being implemented in five states, viz., Assam (100 villages), Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu (225 villages each). There are 44,080 villages having more than 50% SC population.

#### **Objectives**

The aim of PMAGY is to ensure integrated development of the selected 1000 villages with more than 50% SC population into "model villages" so that, *inter alia*,

- 1. They have all requisite physical and social infrastructure for their socio-economic development.
- 2. Disparity between SC and non-SC population in terms of common socio-economic indicators (e.g., literacy rate, completion rate of elementary education, IMR/MMR, ownership of productive assets, etc.) is eliminated, the indicators are raised to at least the level of the national average, and :
  - (a) All BPL families, especially those belonging to SCs, have food and livelihood security, and are enabled to cross the poverty line and earn an adequate livelihood,
  - (b) All children complete at least eight years of education, and
  - (c) Incidence of malnutrition, especially among children and women, is eliminated.
- 3. Untouchability, discrimination, segregation, and atrocities against SCs are eliminated, as are other social evils like discrimination against girls/women, alcoholism and substance (drugs) abuse, etc., and all sections of society are able to live with dignity and equality, and in harmony with others.

#### **Strategy**

The various elements of the strategy to achieve the above objectives are as follows:

- 1. Convergent implementation of various ongoing programmes, with necessary supplementation/gap-filling
- 2. Rural poverty alleviation programmes to be implemented in a manner to ensure flow of adequate benefits to SCs

- 3. To ensure adequate access to bank loans, entrepreneurial training, and marketing support to SC farmers, artisans, craftsmen, traders.
- 4. Better enforcement of legal provisions for the protection of weaker sections, especially SCs.
- 5. If the village has been identified as an atrocity-prone area, taking a slew of measures to improve SCs' security therein.
- 6. To restore lands/houses to SC land/house-owners, who have been unlawfully dispossessed.

## **Target Group**

While the scheme generally covers all sections of society living in the selected villages with more than 50% SC population, special focus is on development of weaker sections like:

- (a) Scheduled Castes,
- (b) Scheduled Tribes,
- (c) Women and children,
- (d) Persons with disability, and
- (e) The destitute.

#### **Components**

The scheme has the following two main components :

- 1. Territorial Area-related Component
- 2. Functional Area-related Component

The first component of the scheme is territorial in nature, and is centered on individual villages. It has following two sub-components.

- (i) Convergent implementation of existing schemes of Central and state governments in the selected villages, and
- (ii) Gap-filling funds from PMAGY in which Central Government's contribution is  $\overline{\epsilon}$ 20 lakh per village (revised from  $\neq 10$  lakh to  $\neq 20$  lakh per village in 2011), with state government making a suitable, preferably matching contribution, for meeting specifically identified developmental requirements of the selected villages which cannot be met under the existing schemes of the Central and state governments.

The functional area-related component is, *inter alia*, meant to facilitate implementation of the scheme by way of strengthening of administrative machinery for its planning and implementation, capability building of key personnel, developing a proper management information system etc. For this component, the state government is eligible for Central assistance upto 5% (revised in 2011 from the earlier 6%) of the outlay for territorial area-related component.

## **BHARAT NIRMAN PROGRAMME**

To unlock huge development potential of rural India, the Government of India has launched a time bound programme titled 'Bharat Nirman' in 2005 initially for a period of four years, i.e., 2005–2009. The programme was initiated by Government of India in partnership with state governments and Panchayati Raj Institutions with the objective to build rural infrastructure and provide basic amenities in rural areas. Under the scheme, projects are taken up in the areas of irrigation, road, rural housing, rural water supply, rural electrification and rural telecommunication connectivity. Specific goals and targets were set in each of these areas.

Under Bharat Nirman, the effort is to impart a sense of urgency to these goals by up-scaling the physical targets under various components and making the programme timebound, transparent as well as accountable. Phase I of the programme was implemented in the period 2005–06 to 2008–09 and on the basis of the outcome, Phase II was implemented from 2009–10 to 2011–12. The time period of the programme has been extended upto the end of 2014 in the case of housing and telephone.

Phase-wise physical targets under each of the components have been identified as mentioned in [Table](#page-24-0) 17.3.

The components-wise details of the programme are given below:

**1. Drinking Water Supply** Bharat Nirman envisages providing safe drinking water to all uncovered habitations by 2012. Supply of safe drinking water in uncovered, slipped back and quality affected habitations is one of the components of Bharat Nirman. Thus Bharat Nirman envisaged covering 55,067 uncovered habitations, 2.8 lakh slipped back habitations and about 2.17 lakh quality affected habitations.

The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is responsible for meeting this goal in partnership with state governments. Against 55,067 un-covered habitations to be covered during the Bharat Nirman period, 54,440 habitations have been covered during Phase-I. The implementation status of the NRDWP under Bharat Nirman Phase-II shows that all the uncovered habitations envisaged under Bharat Nirman have been covered and against an overall physical target of 1,05,479 quality affected habitations to be covered up to 2011–12, a total of 87,028 habitations have been covered upto October, 2012.

**2. Irrigation** Irrigation is one of the six components of Bharat Nirman. There is huge gap between irrigation potential created and the potential utilised. Under Bharat Nirman it is planned to restore and utilise irrigation potential of 10 lakh hectare through implementation of extension, renovation and modernisation of schemes alongwith command area development and water management practices. There are considerable areas in the country with unutilised ground water resources. Irrigation potential of 28 lakh hectare is planned to be created through ground water development. The remaining target for creation of irrigation potential of 10 lakh hectares is planned to be created by way of minor irrigation schemes using surface flow. Ten lakh hectare of irrigation potential is also planned by way of repair, renovation and restoration of water bodies and extension, renovation and modernisation of minor irrigation schemes.

The irrigation potential created was 7.3155 m.ha against a target of 10 m.ha during phase-I and during phase-II 4.460 m.ha irrigation potential was created upto October, 2012.

**3. Roads** Road connectivity is a major component of Bharat Nirman. The aim is to connect all villages that have a population of 1000 (or 500 in hilly/tribal area) with an all-weather road by 2012. This is expected to generate multiplier effects in the rural economy of linking production to markets and services. This work, which is being undertaken under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana since 2000, has been modified to address the above goals within the stipulated time-frame. The funding for the programme is made under the CSS 'Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak' Yojana by Ministry of Rural Development which is 100% funding by the Centre to the states.

New connectivity is proposed to be provided to a total of 54,648 habitations under Bharat Nirman. This will involve construction of 1,46,185.34 km of rural roads. In addition to new connectivity, the scheme also envisages upgradation/renewal of 1,94,130.69 km of existing rural roads. Under the rural roads component of Bharat Nirman, 44,089 habitations have been provided all-weather road connectivity, 2,35,903 km road had upgraded and 1,89,897 km length road has been provided under new connectivity up to March 2012.

**4. Electricity** The Ministry of Power launched Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) as one of its flagship programme in March 2005 with the objective of electrifying over one lakh un-electrified villages and to provide free electricity connections to 2.34 crore rural BPL households. This programme has been brought under the ambit of Bharat Nirman. Under RGGVY, electricity distribution infrastructure is envisaged to establish Rural Electricity Distribution Backbone (REDB) with at least a 33/11 KV sub-station in a block, Village Electrification Infrastructure (VEI) with at least a Distribution Transformer in a village or hamlet, and standalone grids with generation where grid supply is not feasible.

Subsidy towards capital expenditure to the tune of 90% is being provided, through Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC), which is a nodal agency for implementation of the scheme. Electrification of un-electrified Below Poverty Line (BPL) households is being financed with 100% capital subsidy  $\omega$ , 2200 per connection in all rural habitations.

Rural Electrification Corporation is the nodal agency for implementation of the scheme. The services of Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSU) are available to the states for assisting them in the execution of Rural Electrification projects. The Management of Rural Distribution is mandated through franchisees.

The target is to take electricity to all villages and offer electricity connection to 1.75 crore poor households by 2012. By November 2011, 1.75 lakh BPL households were electrified. One lakh unelectrified villages were electrified against a target of electrification of 1.0 lakh unelectrified villages.

**5. Housing** Rural Housing is one of the six components of the Bharat Nirman package. The rural housing programme is implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development through the Indira Awaas Yojana scheme, which is a centrally sponsored scheme where the cost is shared between the Centre and the states on a 75 : 25 basis. The criteria adopted for allocation of financial resources between the States/UTs gives greater emphasis to the states with higher incidence of shelterlessness. Seventyfive per cent weightage is given to housing shortage and 25% weightage to the poverty ratios prescribed by the Planning Commission for state-level allocations. For district-level allocations, 75% weightage is given again to housing shortage and 25% to SC/ST component of the population.

Against a target of construction of 60 lakh houses, 71.76 lakh houses were constructed during the Phase-I of Bharat Nirman under the component of Housing and against a target of construction of 120 lakh houses, 95.1 lakh houses were constructed upto September, 2012.

**6. Rural Telephone Connectivity** The Department of Telecommunications in the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has the responsibility of providing telephone connectivity to the 66,822 villages that remain to be covered. The resources for implementation of universal services obligation are raised through a Universal Service Levy which has presently been fixed at 5% of the adjusted gross revenue of all telecom service providers except the pure valueadded service providers like internet, voice mail, e-mail service providers. The rules also make a provision for the Central Government to give grants and loans to the fund. The balance to the credit of the fund does not lapse at the end of the financial year.

Under Rural Telephony component of Bharat Nirman programme Phase II, the objective is to achieve 40 per cent rural telephony by the year 2014, ensure broadband coverage to all 2.5 lakh Panchayats and set up Bharat Nirman Seva Kendras at Panchayat level by 2012. As on August 2011, rural teledensity of 36.23 per cent was achieved and broadband coverage was extended to 1,38,434 village Panchayats till September, 2011. 62,101 village telephones were provided against a target of 62,302 of VPTs.

## **JAWAHARLAL NEHRU NATIONAL URBAN RENEWAL MISSION**

The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) was launched in 2005 as a flagship programme for urbanisation. The duration of the JNNURM was seven years from 2005–06 to 2011–12. Later, this duration has been extended by three years upto 2014–15 for completion of ongoing projects and reforms.

The aim of JNNURM is to encourage reforms and fast-track planned development of identified cities. The focus is on efficiency in urban infrastructure and service delivery mechanisms, community participation, and accountability of ULBs/Parastatal agencies towards citizens.

## **Objectives**

The objectives of the JNNURM are to ensure that the following are achieved in the urban sector :

- (a) Focussed attention to integrated development of infrastructure services in cities covered under the Mission;
- (b) Establishment of linkages between asset-creation and asset-management through a slew of reforms for long-term project sustainability;
- (c) Ensuring adequate funds to meet the deficiencies in urban infrastructural services;
- (d) Planned development of identified cities including peri-urban areas, outgrowths and urban corridors leading to dispersed urbanisation;
- (e) Scale-up delivery of civic amenities and provision of utilities with emphasis on universal access to the urban poor;
- (f) Special focus on urban renewal programme for the old city areas to reduce congestion; and
- (g) Provision of basic services to the urban poor including security of tenure at affordable prices, improved housing, water supply and sanitation, and ensuring delivery of other existing universal services of the government for education, health and social security.

#### **Components**

The JNNURM comprises two Sub-Missions, namely :

- (i) Urban Infrastructure and Governance (UIG) (Sub-mission I)
- (ii) Basic Services to the Urban Poor (BSUP) (Sub-mission II)

There are, in addition, two other components :

- (i) Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small & Medium Towns (UIDSSMT)
- (ii) Integrated Housing and Slum Development Programme (IHSDP)

The UIG and BSUP are for select 65 large cities and cities of religious/historical/tourist importance while the all other cities/towns are covered under UIDSSMT and IHSDP.

The Ministry of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation is the nodal Ministry for BSUP and IHSDP whereas the Ministry of Urban Development is the nodal Ministry for UIG and UIDSSMT.

The scope of the two Sub-Missions is as follows:

#### **Sub-Mission for Urban Infrastructure and Governance** The main thrust of the Sub-Mission is on

infrastructure projects relating to water supply and sanitation, sewerage, solid waste management, road network, urban transport and redevelopment of old city areas with a view to upgrading infrastructure therein, shifting industrial and commercial establishments to conforming areas, etc.

**Sub-Mission for Basic Services to the Urban Poor** The main thrust of the Sub-Mission is on integrated development of slums through projects for providing shelter, basic services and other related civic amenities with a view to providing utilities to the urban poor.

#### **Strategy**

The objectives of the Mission are met through the adoption of the following strategy:

- (1) **Preparing City Development Plan:** Every city is expected to formulate a City Development Plan (CDP) indicating policies, programmes and strategies, and financing plans.
- (2) **Preparing Projects:** The CDP would facilitate identification of projects. The Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)/parastatal agencies are required to prepare Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) for undertaking projects in the identified spheres. It is essential that projects are planned in a manner that optimises the life-cycle cost of projects. The life-cycle cost of a project would cover the capital outlays and the attendant O&M costs to ensure that assets are in good working condition. A revolving fund would be created to meet the O&M requirements of assets created, over the planning horizon. In order to seek JNNURM assistance, projects would need to be developed in a manner that would ensure and demonstrate optimisation of the life-cycle costs over the planning horizon of the project.
- (3) **Release and Leveraging of Funds:** It is expected that the JNNURM assistance would serve to catalyse the flow of investment into the urban infrastructure sector across the country. Funds from the Central and state government flows directly to the nodal agency designated by the state, as grants-in-aid. The funds for identified projects across cities would be disbursed to the ULB/Parastatal agency through the designated State Level Nodal Agency (SLNA) as soft loan or grant-cum-loan or grant. The SLNA / ULBs in turn would leverage additional resources from other sources.
- (4) **Incorporating Private Sector Efficiencies:** In order to optimise the life-cycle costs over the planning horizon, private sector efficiencies can be inducted in development, management, implementation and financing of projects, through Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements.

## **Expected Outcome**

On completion of the Mission period, it is expected that ULBs and parastatal agencies will have achieved the following:

- (1) Modern and transparent budgeting, accounting, financial management systems, designed and adopted for all urban service and governance functions
- (2) City-wide framework for planning and governance will be established and become operational
- (3) All urban residents will be able to obtain access to a basic level of urban services
- (4) Financially self-sustaining agencies for urban governance and service delivery will be

established, through reforms to major revenue instruments

- (5) Local services and governance will be conducted in a manner that is transparent and accountable to citizens
- (6) E-governance applications will be introduced in core functions of ULBs/Parastatal resulting in reduced cost and time of service delivery processes.

## **RAJIV AWAS YOJANA**

The Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) was launched in the year 2011 in two phases; the preparatory phase for a period of two years which ended in June 2013 and implementation phase. In September 2013, the Central Government has approved the implementation phase for the period of 2013–2022.

The salient features of RAY are as follows:

- **1. Vision** The RAY envisages a "Slum Free India" with inclusive and equitable cities in which every citizen has access to basic civic infrastructure, social amenities and decent shelter.
- **2. Mission** The Mission of RAY is to encourage States/Union Territories (UTs) to tackle slums in a definitive manner, by focusing on:
  - (i) Bringing all existing slums, notified or non-notified (including recognised and identified) within the formal system and enabling them to avail the basic amenities that is available for the rest of the city/UA;
  - (ii) Redressing the failures of the formal system that lie behind the creation of slums by planning for affordable housing stock for the urban poor and initiating crucial policy changes required for facilitating the same.
- **3. Objectives** The objectives of the RAY are as follows:
  - (i) Improving and provisioning of housing, basic civic infrastructure and social amenities in intervened slums.
  - (ii) Enabling reforms to address some of the causes leading to creation of slums.
  - (iii) Facilitating a supportive environment for expanding institutional credit linkages for the urban poor.
  - (iv) Institutionalising mechanisms for prevention of slums including creation of affordable housing stock.
  - (v) Strengthening institutional and human resource capacities at the Municipal, City and State levels through comprehensive capacity building and strengthening of resource networks.
  - (vi) Empowering community by ensuring their participation at every stage of decision making through strengthening and nurturing Slum Dwellers' Association/Federations.
- **4. Scope** The RAY is implemented in a mission mode and provides financial support to States/UTs/Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)/Central Government Agencies, for providing housing and improvement of basic civic infrastructure and social amenities in each selected slums. Rental and transit housing are admissible under the scheme. Operation and maintenance (O&M) of assets created under this scheme are also eligible for funding.

The RAY also extends financial support to states for creation of affordable housing stock through public-private partnership (PPP) under the Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) component of the scheme.

**5. Coverage** The scheme is applicable to all cities/UAs of the country. The selection for seeking assistance under the scheme is made by the states in consultation with the Centre. The
cities/UAs covered under preparatory phase of RAY are automatically included under implementation phase of RAY.

Further, the scheme is applicable to all slums within a city, whether notified or non-notified (including identified and recognised), whether on lands belonging to Central Government or its Undertakings, Autonomous bodies created under the Act of Parliament, State Government or its Undertakings, Urban Local Bodies or any other public agency and private sector. It is also applicable to "urbanised villages" inside the planning area of the city, urban homeless and pavement dwellers.

**6. Implementation Approach** Two-step implementation strategy is adopted i.e., preparation of Slum-free City Plans of Action on 'whole city' basis and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) on 'whole slum' basis for selected slums.

The strategy to tackle slums would need to be in two parts—(a) Curative Strategy for slum redevelopment of all existing slums; and (b) Preventive Strategy for containment of growth of future slums.

- **7. Affordable Housing in Partnership Scheme** In order to increase affordable housing stock, as part of the preventive strategy, Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) is implemented as part of the scheme. The Central support is provided at the rate of  $\epsilon$ 75,000 per EWS/LIG DUs (Dwelling Units) for housing and internal development components in affordable housing projects taken up under various kinds of partnerships. A project size of minimum 250 dwelling units are considered under the scheme.
- **8. Credit Risk Guarantee Fund** A Credit Risk Guarantee Fund has been created to guarantee the lending agencies for loans to new EWS/LIG borrowers in urban areas seeking individual housing loans not exceeding a sum of  $\overline{5}$  lakh for a housing unit.

## **NATIONAL URBAN LIVELIHOODS MISSION**

In 2013, the Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY) was restructured and renamed as the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM). The SJSRY was launched in 1997 to provide gainful employment to the urban unemployed and underemployed poor.

The objective of NULM is to reduce poverty and vulnerability of the urban poor households by enabling them to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities. This should result in an appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong grassroots level institutions of the poor. The mission also aims at providing shelter equipped with essential services to the urban homeless in a phased manner. In addition, the mission also addresses livelihood concerns of the urban street vendors.

The NULM is implemented in all District Headquarter Towns and all other cities with a population of 100,000 or more. The target of NULM is the urban population identified as below poverty line population in urban areas by the States/UTs. The coverage may be broadened to include families of disadvantaged groups like SCs, STs, women, minorities, disabled etc. subject to a maximum of 25 per cent of the above urban poor population.

The financing of the mission is shared between the Centre and the States/UTs in the ratio of 75 : 25 and in the case of North Eastern and special category states, the ratio is 90 : 10.

The NULM has the following components:

1. **Social Mobilisation and Institution Development** NULM envisages universal social

mobilisation of urban poor into Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and their federations. At least one member from each urban poor household, preferably a woman, should be brought under the Self-Help Group network in a time-bound manner. These groups will serve as a support system for the poor, to meet their financial and social needs.

- 2. **Capacity Building and Training** The objective of this component is to establish timely and high quality technical assistance at Central, State and City levels to roll out and implement NULM. A National Mission Management Unit (NMMU) is established at the Centre. Additionally, support to states and cities is provided for setting-up of State Mission Management Unit (SMMU) and City Mission Management Unit (CMMU).
- 3. **Employment Through Skills Training and Placement** This component focuses on providing assistance for development/upgrading of the skills of the urban poor so as to enhance their capacity for self-employment and salaried employment.
- 4. **Self-Employment Programme** This component focuses on financial assistance to individuals/groups of urban poor for setting up gainful self-employment ventures / microenterprises, suited to their skills, training, aptitude and local conditions.
- 5. **Support to Urban Street Vendors** This component aims at skilling of street vendors, support micro-enterprise development, credit enablement and pro-vending urban planning along with supporting social security options for vulnerable groups such as women, SCs/STs and minorities.
- 6. **Scheme of Shelter for Urban Homeless** The objective of this scheme is to provide shelter and all other essential services to the poorest of the poor segment of urban societies. The shelters should be permanent all-weather shelters for the urban homeless.
- 7. **Innovative and Special Projects** This component focuses on the promotion of novel initiatives in the form of innovative projects. These initiatives may be in the nature of pioneering efforts, aimed at catalysing sustainable approaches to urban livelihoods through Public, Private, Community Partnership (P-P-CP), demonstrating a promising methodology or making a distinct impact on the urban poverty situation through scalable initiatives.

# **INTEGRATED LOW COST SANITATION SCHEME**

#### **Background**

As per Allocation of Business Rules, sanitation relating to urban areas, sewerage and drainage are the subjects allocated to Ministry of Urban Development. However, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (HUPA) has been made the nodal ministry to monitor the implementation of the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993, which prohibits construction and/or maintenance of dry latrines and employment of manual scavengers. The obnoxious practice of manual scavenging or engaging fellow human beings into cleaning the untreated human excreta is a blot on the society. The Government of India is deeply concerned about liberation of manual scavengers from the inhuman task of carrying night soil.

The Integrated Low Cost Sanitation (ILCS) Scheme aims at conversion of individual dry latrines into pour flush latrines thereby liberating manual scavengers from the age old, obnoxious practice of manually carrying night soil. The ILCS Scheme was initially started in 1980-81 through the Ministry of Home Affairs and later was being implemented through Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. The scheme was transferred in 1989-90 to Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation and from 2003-04 onwards to Ministry of HUPA which revised the guidelines in January 2008.

#### **Revised Scheme**

Under the revised guidelines of the ILCS scheme, funds for conversion of 2,51,963 and construction of 1,55,937 units have been approved to the States of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, West Bengal, Kerala, Manipur, Nagaland, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Tripura, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha.

Since, state governments had informed successfully converting all reported dry latrines under ILCS Scheme during the Eleventh Plan period, the scheme was proposed to be discontinued during the 12th Plan Period. However, the provisional figures released by Census of India, 2011 highlighted that there are 7,94,390 latrines serviced by humans out of which 2, 08,323 are located in urban areas. In view of the provisional figures on latrines serviced by humans released by the Census of India 2011, it has been decided to extend the Integrated Low Cost Sanitation Scheme with revised features and cost estimates in the Twelfth Plan to cover all existing dry latrines which are serviced by human beings. The approval of Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has been received in November 2012 at a total subsidy of  $\frac{1}{3}$ 367.16 crore.

#### **New Features**

The continued ILCS has following new features:

- 1. To increase the unit of cost of twin pit pour flush latrines from  $\neq 10,000$  to  $\neq 15,000$  (for hilly areas from  $\sqrt{12,500}$  to  $\sqrt{18,750}$ .
- 2. When the states decide to adopt environment friendly and maintenance free technologies like bio-toilets/eco-san toilets or any other such innovative technologies, an additional funding up to 15% over and above the normal cost are provided. Unit cost of bio-toilets/eco-san toilets for general category is  $\sqrt{17,250}$  (for hilly areas  $\sqrt{21,563}$ ).
- 3. The other components of ILCS scheme are to continue as per the existing guidelines.
- 4. All sanctions under the scheme are to be completed by the year 2014.

# **RAJIV RINN YOJANA**

The Rajiv Rinn Yojana (RRY) is an instrument to address the housing needs of the EWS/LIG segments in urban areas, through enhanced credit flow. It is also formulated to channelise institutional credit to the poorer segments of the society and increasing home ownership in the country along with addressing housing shortage.

The RRY has been formulated by modifying the Interest Subsidy Scheme for Housing the Urban Poor (ISHUP) piloted in the Eleventh Plan period with enhanced scope and coverage. The RRY is a Central Sector Scheme applicable in all the urban areas of the country.

The tenure of ISHUP expired on September 30, 2013 and Rajiv Rinn Yojana is effective from

October 1, 2013. The salient features of the scheme are mentioned below:

- 1. **Purpose** The scheme provides home loan with Central Government interest subsidy to EWS/LIG persons for acquisition/construction of house. Assistance is also available to such of the EWS/LIG beneficiaries who intend to make additions to the existing dwelling units. Such beneficiaries who own land in any urban area but do not have any pucca house is also covered under the scheme.
- 2. **Eligibility** The economic parameter of EWS is defined as households having an average annual income up to  $\epsilon$ 1,00,000 and the economic parameter of LIG is defined as households having an average annual income between  $\neq 1,00,001$  and  $\neq 2,00,000$ .
- 3. **Loan Amount Admissible** The scheme provides an interest subsidy for a maximum amount of  $5,00,000$  for an EWS individual for a house. Additional loans, if needed would be at unsubsidised rates. The loan tenure can be between 15–20 years. A maximum loan amount of  $\epsilon$ 8,00,000 for an LIG individual is admissible. However, subsidy is given for loan amount up to  $\overline{5}$  lakh only. Additional loan amount between  $\overline{5}$  lakh and  $\overline{8}$ lakh, if taken would be at unsubsidised rates. The loan tenure can be between 15–20 years.
- 4. **Subsidy** The subsidy is 5% p.a. on interest charged on the admissible loan amount for EWS and LIG, for construction or acquisition of a new house or for carrying out addition to the existing building.
- 5. The Central Nodal Agencies (CNA) for the scheme are the National Housing Bank (NHB) and Housing & Urban Development Corporation Ltd. (HUDCO). The nodal agencies will not lend directly to the borrower but through banks or Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) who agree to be part of the scheme.
- 6. The scheme will currently close on March 31, 2017, the last year of the Twelfth Five Year Plan Period (2012–17). However, the loans extended in the last year will also have repayment period up to 15–20 years and suitable budgetary provisions will be made thereafter.

The scheme will be monitored and concurrently evaluated independently at the end of the Twelfth Plan, i.e., in the year 2017. A decision about continuation in the present form or the amended form will be taken on the basis there of.

- 7. State governments are allowed to dovetail their state housing schemes with RRY.
- 8. An amount of 2.5% of the scheme funds area earmarked for IEC, A&OE, PMU and MIS.
- 9. **Selection of Beneficiaries** The borrowers under the scheme must belong to the EWS or LIG, and must have a plot of land for the construction or have identified a purchasable house as part of a group housing/apartment scheme or an existing house where addition to the living space is intended to be made. Borrowers would be free to approach and negotiate a loan under the scheme directly with the lender. However, it is envisaged that such borrowers would be few. Most borrowers and lenders would require the intercession of state Governments/Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to identify borrowers with land, help them with preparation of papers and liaise for them with the lenders.
- 10. The voluntary NGOs may also be involved by State Governments/ULBs in building awareness about the scheme among the urban poor. The applications duly filled through NGOs may also be accepted by the Banks and HFCs.
- 11. In identifying beneficiaries, the ULB or the local agency identified by the state should as far as possible identify clusters in which land has been allotted and housing can be supported through this scheme within such clusters. The preference under the scheme (subject to

beneficiaries being from EWS/LIG segments) should be given to Women, Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Minorities and Persons with disabilities.

12. **Applicants** Applicants planning to form cooperative group housing societies or organisations like Employees Welfare Housing, Labour Housing, etc. should be given preference and wherever possible construction of houses by such cooperatives by way of 1+3 storeyed buildings should be promoted so that cost of land is shared among beneficiaries. However, this is not a mandatory requirement. Both individuals as well as Group Housing borrowers are equally eligible under the scheme.

## **TWENTY POINT PROGRAMME**

The Twenty Point Programme (TPP) was launched by the Government of India in the year 1975 and restructured in the year 1982, 1986 and again in 2006. The restructured programme, known as Twenty-Point Programme (TPP) – 2006, became operational from 2007. The programme is meant to give a thrust to schemes relating to poverty alleviation, employment generation in rural areas, housing, education, family welfare and health, protection of environment and many other schemes having a bearing on the quality of life, especially in the rural areas.

The programmes and schemes under the TPP-2006 are in harmony with the priorities contained in the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP), the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of the United Nations and SAARC Social Charter. The original nomenclature, namely the Twenty-Point Programme, which has been in existence for more than three decades and carries the stamp of familiarity among the people and administrative agencies, has been retained.

The Twenty-Point Programme (TPP)–2006 originally consisted of 20 points and 66 items being monitored individually by Central Nodal Ministries concerned. From 2008, Sampoorna Grameen Rojgar Yojana (SGRY) has been merged with another item namely "National Rural Employment Guarantee Act" which has now been renamed as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act from 2009. Therefore, SGRY has been dropped from the list of 66 items and only 65 items are now monitored under TPP–2006 since 2008–09. The 65 items are given as follows in [Table](#page-34-0) 17.4.

## **MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT LOCAL AREA DEVELOPMENT SCHEME**

The Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) was launched in 1993 to provide a mechanism for Members of Parliament to recommend works of developmental nature for creation of durable community assets and for provision of basic facilities including community infrastructure, based on locally felt needs. Thus, addressing locally felt developmental and infrastructural needs and bridging the gap for developmental works is envisaged under the Scheme.

The salient features of the MPLAD Scheme are as follows:

- 1. MPLADS is a Plan scheme under which funds are released in the form of Grant-in-aid, as Special Central Assistance to States.
- 2. Works which are developmental in nature, based on locally felt needs and always available for public use at large, are eligible under the scheme.

- 3. The Members of Parliament have a recommendatory role under the Scheme. The MPs recommend the works based on locally felt needs to the concerned District Authorities who get the works implemented by following the established procedure of the concerned state government.
- 4. Examining the eligibility, sanctioning, funding, selection of implementing agencies, prioritisation and overall execution and monitoring of the scheme at the ground level, is done by the district authorities.
- 5. The Lok Sabha Members can recommend works in their respective constituencies. The elected members of the Rajya Sabha can recommend works anywhere in the state from which they are elected. Nominated Members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha may select works for implementation anywhere in the country.
- 6. The funds released under the scheme are non-lapsable, i.e., the liability of funds not released in a particular year is carried forward for making releases in the subsequent years subject to eligibility. The annual entitlement per MP is  $\neq$  5 crore from 2011–12. In 1993–94, when the scheme was launched, an amount of  $\overline{5}$  lakh per MP was allotted which was enhanced to  $\overline{5}$  l crore per annum from 1994–95 per MP constituency. This was further increased to  $\neq 2$  crore from 1998–99. Now it has been increased from  $\frac{1}{2}$  crore to  $\frac{1}{2}$  crore from 2011–12.
- 7. Important items of work like drinking water, education, public health, and funds for development of SC/ST are given priority.
- 8. There is no limit for a work to be executed by government agencies. There is a ceiling of  $\epsilon$ 25 lakh for the works to any Trust/Society. Also to encourage Trusts/Societies to work for the betterment of the tribal people, the ceiling of 25 lakh has been increased to 37.50 lakh where the additional amount of ` 12.50 lakh should be used for the creation of public utility building assets primarily for the benefit of tribal people exclusively in the notified tribal CD blocks with more than 50% tribal population.
- 9. MPLADS emphasises work relating to provision of drinking water in the notified drought affected districts, such as hand pumps for drinking water, storage tanks, reservoirs, community rain water harvesting, etc.
- 10. The maximum limit for rehabilitation work in areas affected by severe calamities is now  $\epsilon$ 50 lakh.
- 11. In order to give special attention to development of areas inhabited by Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, 15% of MPLADS funds would be utilised for areas inhabited by SC population and 7.5% for areas inhabited by ST population and if there is no tribal population in the constituency of the Lok Sabha members of Parliament, they can recommend works within their state of election upto 7.5% of their annual entitlement in the notified CD blocks with more than 50% tribal population.
- 12. The role of Panchayati Raj Institutions and Urban Local Bodies as Implementing Agencies is stressed.
- 13. Release of first installment equal to 50% of annual entitlement in respect of MPs at the time of constitution of Lok Sabha and election to the Rajya Sabha is done automatically without waiting for any document from district authorities.
- 14. To bring in more financial accountability, Utilisation Certificate for the previous financial year and the Audit Certificate for the funds released in the year prior to the previous year are also pre-requisites for the release of the second instalment. From 2012–13, release of first instalment is made on the basis of the release of second instalment of previous year being

made and also provisional Utilisation Certificate to be given by the District Authority in respect of 80% of entitlement of first instalment of previous year.

- 15. Funds received by the Government of India are deposited by the District Administrations in nationalised banks.
- 16. The normal financial and audit procedures prevalent in the states in which the works are executed apply with regard to the implementation of the works.
- 17. The roles of Central Government, State Government, District Authorities and Implementing Agencies have been clearly demarcated for implementation of MPLAD Scheme.
- 18. The MPLADS Parliamentary Committee of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha make suggestions and recommendations to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on representations received from MPs and issues raised by the MPs from time to time.
- 19. The role of the Central Government *inter-alia* is to monitor overall position of fund release, receipt of completion reports etc. and to bring out the annual report on the implementation of MPLADS.
- 20. The role of the State/UT Government *inter-alia* is to coordinate with the ministry as well as from district authorities for effective implementation of the scheme.
- 21. The role of the District Authority *inter-alia* is to inspect and monitor the works regularly.
- 22. The implementing agencies are to furnish physical and financial progress of each work to the District Authorities every month and also furnish completion report certificates.

## **One "MP–One Idea Scheme"**

In the year 2012, the government announced a new scheme "One MP–One Idea" under the Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS). In order to foster, a grass-root bottoms-up approach to innovation and development and to arrive at solutions for local problems which are sustainable and scalable, there is a need for seeking out and campaigning for ideas that have the potential to solve challenges. Accordingly, based on the innovative ideas received from the local people regarding developmental projects, a 'One MP–One Idea' competition may be held in each Lok Sabha constituency annually to select the three best innovations for cash awards on the specific request of an MP to promote such a scheme in his/her constituency.

Under the scheme, the applications are invited for providing innovative solutions pertaining to social issues, especially in the area of education and skills, health, water and sanitation, housing and infrastructure, agriculture, energy, environment, community and social service, etc. These innovative solutions are evaluated in a transparent manner by a selection committee headed by the DC/DM of the Nodal District and consisting of six members from Engineering, Finance, Health and Sanitation, Academia, Industry and Banking and Financial Institutions.

The Member of Parliament awards Certificate of Honour along with cash award of  $\epsilon$  2.5 lakh,  $\epsilon$ 1.5 lakh and  $\neq$  lakh to the first, second and third best innovative solutions respectively through his MPLAD funds in a public function. In addition, a Certificate of Appreciation is given to the next five best innovations. This scheme would inspire people to find innovative solutions to social and developmental problems.
