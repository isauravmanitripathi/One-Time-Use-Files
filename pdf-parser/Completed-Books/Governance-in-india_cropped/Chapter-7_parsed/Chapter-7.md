# **EVOLUTION OF CIVIL SERVICE**

The term 'civil service' and the system called 'civil service system' were introduced in India for the first time by the Britishers during the East India Company rule (in 17th century). In the beginning, the servants of the Company who were engaged in its commercial affairs were called as 'civil servants' to distinguish them from the military and naval personnel of the Company. In 1675, the Company created a regular gradation of posts in the following manner (mentioned in the ascending manner).

- (i) Apprentice
- (ii) Writer
- (iii) Factor
- (iv) Junior Merchant
- (v) Senior Merchant

Later on, when the Company acquired control over territories, the civil servants also assumed administrative tasks. By 1765, the term 'civil servant' came to be used in the company's official records.

The efforts of Lord Warren Hastings and Lord Cornwallis led to the rise of civil service. Hastings laid the foundations of civil service and Cornwallis reformed, modernised and rationalised it. Hence, he (Cornwallis) came to be known as the 'Father of Civil Service' in India. He introduced the 'Covenanted civil services' (higher civil services) which were different from the 'Uncovenanted civil services' (lower civil services). The former was created by a law of the company, while the latter was created otherwise. However, he reserved all the covenanted services for the Europeans (i.e. English personnel) and thus excluded Indians from superior posts. This policy of Cornwallis was based on the following reasons.

- (i) He was doubtful about the integrity and ability of Indians.
- (ii) He thought that the task of establishing and consolidating the British rule in India could not be left to the natives.
- (iii) He believed that an administration based on the British model could be strongly established in India only by the Englishmen and not by the natives.
- (iv) He wanted to preserve the lucrative posts in civil services for the influential class of British society.

In 1800, Lord Wellesly (the then Governor-General) established a college at Fort William in Calcutta (presently Kolkata) to provide training to the civil servants of the Company. As this move of Wellesley was not favoured by the Court of Directors, (i.e. the governing body of the East India

Company) they established the East India College at Haileybury in England in 1806 for the same purpose.

The Charter Act of 1833 attempted to introduce a system of open competition as the basis of selection of civil servants of the Company, and stated that the Indians should not be debarred from holding any place, office and employment under the Company. However, this provision of the Act was negated due to the opposition of the Court of Directors which wanted to continue the patronage system.

**Macauley Committee** The Charter Act of 1853 abolished the patronage system and introduced an open Competition system as a basis of selection and recruitment of civil servants of the Company. Thus, the Court of Directors was deprived of its patronage power and the covenanted civil service was thrown open to competition to the Indians also under the rules to be framed by the Board of Control. Accordingly, the Macauley Committee (the committee on the Indian civil service) was appointed in 1854 to suggest measures to give effect to the above provisions of the Act.

The committee made the following recommendations in its report submitted in 1854.

- (i) An open competition system should be adopted for recruitment to the civil services.
- (ii) The age of candidates for admission to the tests should be 18 to 23 years.
- (iii) The competitive examinations should be held in London.
- (iv) There should be a probationary period for the candidates before they are finally appointed.
- (v) The East India College at Hailleybury should be abolished.
- (vi) The competitive examination should be of a high standard and should ensure the selection of candidates with thorough knowledge.

All the above recommendations were accepted and implemented by the Board of Control. The first competitive examination was held in London in 1855 under the Board of Control. Later on in 1858, this responsibility was transferred to the British Civil Service Commission (set up in 1855). Similarly, the East India College was abolished in 1858 and training to the civil servants was imparted in British universities. However, the first Indian (Satyendranath Tagore) could enter into the covenanted civil service only in 1864.

The Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 provided for the reservation of certain principal posts for members of the covenanted service. The next statutory Civil Service Act of 1870 remedied the defects of 1861 Act and provided for the Indianisation of services. However, it could be implemented only in 1879 by Lord Lytton, the then Viceroy.

**Aitchison Commission** In 1886, Public Service Commission under the chairmanship of Charles Aitchison was appointed to devise a scheme to do full justice to the claims of Indians to higher and more extensive employment in public service. The Aitchison Commission made the following recommendations in its report submitted in 1887.

- (i) The two-tier classification of civil services into covenanted and uncovenanted should be replaced by a three-tier classification *viz*. imperial, provincial and subordinate civil services.
- (ii) The maximum age for entry into civil services should be fixed at 23 years.
- (iii) The statutory civil service system of recruitment should be abolished.
- (iv) The competitive examination should not be held simultaneously in England and India.
- (v) Certain percentage of the posts in the imperial civil service should be filled by promotion of the members of the provincial civil service.

The above recommendations of the Commission were largely accepted and implemented. The

statutory civil service was abolished in 1892.

**Islington Commission** Again in 1912, Royal Commission on public services in India under the chairmanship of Lord Islington was appointed. The Islington Commission made the following recommendations in its report submitted in 1915:

- (i) Recruitment to the superior posts should be made partly in England and partly in India. But, it did not favour the idea of holding the competitive examinations simultaneously in England and India.
- (ii) 25 per cent of the superior posts should be filled by Indians partly by direct recruitment and partly by promotion.
- (iii) The services under the Government of India should be categorised into Class I and Class II.
- (iv) The principle of maintenance of efficiency should be adopted while fixing the salaries of civil servants.
- (v) There should be a probationary period of two years for direct recruits. For the ICS, it should be three years.

The report of the commission could be published only in 1917, when the recommendations contained in it became out-dated due to the first World War and the August Declaration of 1917. Hence, no serious consideration was given to them.

**Montford Report** The next milestone in the evolution of civil service was the Montague– Chelmsford Report (or Montford Report or Report on Indian Constitutional Reforms) of 1918 which made the following recommendations:

- (i) 33 percent of the superior posts should be recruited in India and this percentage should be increased by 1.5 per cent annually.
- (ii) The competitive examinations should be held simultaneously in England and India.
- (iii) The members of the ICS should be given fair salary, pension benefits and allowances.

The above recommendations were accepted and implemented by enacting the Government of India Act of 1919. On the eve of this Act, the following nine All-India Services existed:

- (i) Indian Civil Service
- (ii) Indian Police Service
- (iii) Indian Forest Service
- (iv) Indian Forest Engineering Service
- (v) Indian Service of Engineers
- (vi) Indian Civil Veterinary Service
- (vii) Indian Medical Service
- (viii) Indian Educational Service
  - (ix) Indian Agricultural Service

The last to be added to the list of All-India Services was the Indian Agricultural Service in 1906– 1907. The members of these services were recruited and controlled by the Secretary of State for India. Hence, these services were also known as the Secretary of State's Services. Notably, the term 'All-India Service' was first coined in 1918 by the Committee on Division of Functions (Chairman – M E Gauntlett).

As a result of the reforms of 1918 and 1919, the first competitive examination (the ICS examination) was held in India (at Allahabad) in 1922 under the supervision of the British Civil

Service Commission. By this time, five methods of entry into the Superior Civil Services came into existence. They were:

- (i) By open competitive examinations held in England;
- (ii) By separate competitive examinations held in India;
- (iii) By appointments from the Bar (in case of judicial positions);
- (iv) By promotion from the provincial civil services; and
- (v) By nomination (in India) to facilitate communal and provincial representation.

In 1922, a Staff Selection Board was set up by the Government of India for the recruitment to the lower services. It functioned till 1926, when its functions were taken over by the newly established public service commission.

**Lee Commission** In 1923, the Royal Commission on superior civil services in India under the chairmanship of Lord Viscount Lee was appointed. The Commission made the following recommendations in its report submitted in 1924.

- (i) The Indian Civil Service, Indian Police Service, Indian Medical Service, Indian Service of Engineers (irrigation branch) and Indian Forest Service (except in the Bombay province) should be retained. The members of these services were continued to be appointed as well as controlled by the Secretary of State for India.
- (ii) No further recruitment should be made to other all-India services *viz.*, the Indian Agricultural Service, Indian Veterinary Service, Indian Educational Service, Indian Service of Engineers (roads and building branch) and Indian Forest service (only in Bombay province). The members of these services should in future be appointed and controlled by the provincial governments.
- (iii) For effecting Indianisation of services, twenty per cent of the superior posts should be filled by promotion from the provincial civil service. Direct recruitments should be in equal proportions for Indians and Englishmen so that a ratio of 50 : 50 is produced in about 15 years.
- (iv) The British officers should be allowed to retire on proportionate pensions if they are not willing to work under Indian ministers.
- (v) A public service commission, as provided by the Government of India Act of 1919, should be established.

The above recommendations were accepted and implemented by the British Government, as result of which a Central Public Service Commission was set up in 1926 and entrusted with the task of recruiting civil servants. The commission was composed of a chairman and four other members. Sir Ross Barker, a senior member of the British Home Civil Service, was the first chairman. In 1937 (when the 1935 Act became operative), the commission was replaced by the Federal Public Service Commission which was finally replaced by the UPSC on January 26, 1950 (when the Constitution of India came into force).

The Government of India Act of 1935 provided for the protection of the rights and privileges of the members of civil services. It also provided for the establishment of not only a Federal Public Service Commission but also a Provincial Public Service Commission and Joint Public Service Commission for two or more provinces.

In 1947, there were only two all-India services—the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police Service. In addition, there were various Central and state services. The Central services were

## **ALL-INDIA AND CENTRAL SERVICES**

## **All-India Services**

All-India Services are those services which are common to both Central and state governments. It must be mentioned here that the Central and state governments have their separate services called the Central Services and the State Services respectively. Thus, the All-India Services are in addition to the Central and State Services.

At present, there are three All-India Services. They are:

- Indian Administrative Service (IAS)
- п Indian Police Service (IPS)
- п Indian Forest Service (IFS)

In 1947, Indian Civil Service (ICS) was replaced by IAS, and the Indian Police (IP) was replaced by IPS and were recognised by the Constitution as All-India Services. In 1963, three more All-India Services were created. They are:

- Indian Forest Service
- П Indian Medical and Health Service
- П Indian Service of Engineers

However, out of these three, only the Indian Forest Service came into existence in 1966. At present, there are only three All-India Services— IAS, IPS and IFS.

Article 312 of the Constitution authorises the Parliament of India to create new All-India Services on the basis of a resolution passed by Rajya Sabha to that effect. Thus, a new All-India Service can be created only by an Act of Parliament and not by a resolution of Rajya Sabha. However, the Parliament cannot do so without the recommendation of Rajya Sabha. This power is given to the Rajya Sabha to protect the interests of states in the Indian federal system.

Interestingly, the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly did not provide a constitutional status to the All-India Services. Accordingly, the Draft Constitution did not make any mention of the All-India Services. However, the Constituent Assembly included provisions with respect to the All-India Services which were approved. These provisions (under Article 312) not only gave a constitutional status to the All-India Services but also provided for the creation of new All-India Services. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the chief protagonist of All-India Services in the Constituent Assembly. Hence, he came to be regarded as the 'Father of All-India Services'.

The All-India Services Act of 1951 authorised the Central Government to make rules in consultation with the state governments for the regulation of recruitment and service conditions of the members of All-India Services. The members of these Services are recruited and trained by the Central Government but are assigned to different states for work. They are borne on different state cadres; the Centre having no cadre of its own in this regard. They serve the Central Government on deputation and after completing their fixed tenure they go back to their respective states. The Central Government obtains the services of these officers on deputation under the well-known tenure system. It must be mentioned here that irrespective of their division among different states, each of these All-India Services form a single service with common rights and status and uniform scales of pay throughout the country. All the three All-India Services are Class-I (Group-A) Services.

The All-India Services have three categories. They are:

- Super time scale
- $\blacksquare$ Senior scale
- $\blacksquare$ Junior scale

In the beginning, the officers are appointed in the junior scale. In the course of time, they are placed in the senior scale and the super time scale.

The three All-India Services are managed and controlled by three different Ministries of the Central Government. They are:

- IAS by the Ministry of Personnel
- $\blacksquare$ IPS by the Ministry of Home
- $\blacksquare$ IFS by the Ministry of Environment and Forests

It must be mentioned here that the All-India Services are controlled jointly by the Central and state governments. The ultimate control lies with the Central Government while the immediate control vests with the state governments. Their salaries and pensions are met by the states. But the disciplinary action (imposition of penalities) against these officers can only be taken by the Central Government.

Presently, there are 24 state cadres in all for the All-India Services. This includes three joint cadres— (i) Assam and Meghalaya, (ii) Manipur and Tripura, and (iii) Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and the Union Territories (AGMUT). The authorised cadre strength of the three All-India Services in all the states is mentioned in [Table](#page-5-0) 7.1.

### **Central Services**

The personnel of Central Services work under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Central Government. They man specialised (functional and technical) positions in various departments of the Central Government. Most of them are controlled and managed by their respective ministries/departments, while a few of them are controlled and managed by the Ministry of Personnel. It (Ministry of Personnel) also determines the general policies pertaining to all the Central Services. In fact, the Ministry of Personnel is the central personnel agency in the Government of India.

The Central Services consists of the Central Civil Services and the General Central Service. The Central Civil Services are the established Services while the General Central Service comprise the Central civil posts which are created outside the established services, that is, not included in any Central Civil Service.

Before Independence, the Central Services were classified into Class I, Class II, Subordinate and Inferior services. The nomenclature of Subordinate and Inferior Services was replaced by Class III

and Class IV Services on the recommendation of the First Pay Commission (1946–1947). Again in 1974, the classification of Central Services into Class I, Class II, Class III and Class IV was changed to Group A, Group B, Group C and Group D, respectively. This was done on the recommendation of the Third Pay Commission (1970–1973). Thus, as of now, the Central Services (i.e. both established as well as general) are classified into four categories. They are:

- Central Services, Group A
- $\blacksquare$ Central Services, Group B
- П Central Services, Group C
- П Central Services, Group D

The Group A Central Services are listed below:

- 1. Indian Foreign Service
- 2. Indian P&T Accounts and Finance Service
- 3. Indian Postal Service
- 4. Indian Railway Accounts Service
- 5. Indian Railway Personnel Service
- 6. Indian Railway Traffic Service
- 7. Indian Audit and Accounts Service
- 8. Central Information Service
- 9. Indian Defence Accounts Service
- 10. Defence Lands and Cantonment Service
- 11. Indian Ordnance Factories Service (Non-Technical)
- 12. Indian Civil Accounts Service
- 13. Indian Revenue Service (Income Tax)
- 14. Indian Customs and Central Excise Service
- 15. Central Secretariat Service
- 16. Indian Railway Service of Mechanical Engineers
- 17. Indian Railway Service of Electrical Engineers
- 18. Indian Railway Service of Engineers
- 19. Indian Railway Service of Signal Engineers
- 20. Indian Railway Stores Service
- 21. Indian Telecommunication Service
- 22. Central Trade Service
- 23. Indian Defence Estates Service
- 24. Military Engineering Service
- 25. Indian Ordnance Factories Service (Technical)
- 26. Indian Naval Armament Service
- 27. Central Power Engineering Service
- 28. Indian Supply Service
- 29. Indian Inspection Service
- 30. Indian Salt Service
- 31. Central Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Service
- 32. Central Water Engineering Service (Civil)
- 33. Central Engineering Service
- 34. Central Engineering Service (Roads)
- 35. Border Roads Engineering Service

- 36. Indian Broadcasting (Engs.) Service
- 37. Overseas Communication Service
- 38. Central Health Service
- 39. Railway Medical Service
- 40. Indian Ordnance Factories Health Service
- 41. Indian Economic Service
- 42. Indian Statistical Service
- 43. Indian Cost Accounts Service
- 44. Defence Quality Assurance Service
- 45. Defence Research and Development Service
- 46. Defence Aeronautical Quality Assurance Service
- 47. Central Legal Service
- 48. Company Law Board Service
- 49. Survey of India Service
- 50. Military Engineers Service of Architects
- 51. Military Engineers Service of Surveyors
- 52. Central Water Engineering Service (Mechnical)
- 53. Indian Defence Service of Engineers
- 54. P & T Building Works Service
- 55. Central Labour Service
- 56. Railway Protection Force
- 57. Indian Broadcasting (Programme) Service
- 58. Armed Forces Headquarters Civil Service

Most of the above cadres of Group A Central Services have also corresponding Group B Services. The Group C Central Services consists of clerical personnel while Group D consists of manual personnel. Thus Group A and Group B comprises of gazetted officers while Group C and Group D are non-gazetted class.

It must also be mentioned here that the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) is the top most Central Service in terms of prestige, status, pay and emoluments. In fact, it (though a Central Service) competes with the All-India Services in position, status and pay scales. It comes next to the IAS in ranking and its pay scale is higher than the IPS. It is managed by the Ministry of External Affairs. Its recruits serve the Indian missions and embassies abroad.

## **ROLE OF ALL-INDIA SERVICES**

### **Rationale**

The arguments put forward in favour of the All-India Services are:

**National Integration** They promote national integration as the members of these services possess an all-India outlook. As they are usually posted in states other than their own, they can function beyond the regional, linguistic and communal interests.

**Efficiency** They help in maintaining high standard of administration in terms of administrative

efficiency in the Centre as well as in states. During the British period, they were called the 'Steelframe of administrative structure'.

**Uniformity** They help to ensure uniformity of the administrative system throughout the nation. The members of these services are rotated between the Centre and the states.

**Co-operative Federalism** They facilitate liaison, cooperation, coordination and joint action on the issues and problems of common interest, between the Centre and the states.

**Repository of Talent** They attract the best talent in the country due to the wide field of recruitment, high remuneration, status and prestige.

**President's Rule** When the President's Rule is in operation in any state, he can depend on the loyalty and cooperation of these offices for efficient administration. This is because, they are appointed and removed only by the President of India.

**Independence** They promote independence and impartiality of civil service at the highest level. As members of these services enjoy the constitutional safeguards, they are free from regional and local pressures and influences. Hence, they can afford to give free and frank advice to the state ministers.

**Rich Experience** They facilitate the interchange of rich experience among different states. It must be mentioned here that the officers of all-India Services serve not only the state governments and Central Government but the union territories and local governments as well (both urban and rural). Thus their rich experience can be used for the benefit of the whole country.

**Beneficial to States** The talent mobilised through national recruitment to these services is distributed among the states. Hence, the states which are deficient in their manpower supply to fill the high and strategic positions will be benefitted.

**Continuity** They are the continuation of the old administrative arrangement developed during the British period. The members of these services during the British rule constituted the highest rung of the administrative hierarchy. The IAS, the only multi-purpose All-India Service, is the direct descendent of the erstwhile ICS which was called as the 'Heaven-born Service'.

### **Criticism**

The arguments put forward against the All-India Services are:

**Hang-over of the Past** These services were created during the period of British rule in India. At that time, the structure of government was unitary and nature of state was authoritarian. After independence, the structure of government and the nature of state underwent a radical transformation. In this changed scenario, the All-India Services have no place.

**Against Federation** These Services are against the federal system of government provided by the Constitution. They restrict the autonomy and patronage of the states. Since 1950, they have been an point of dispute and problem area between the Centre and states. The states have not supported the creation of more All-India Services inspite of a constitutional provision in this regard. In fact, the Rajamannar Committee (constituted by the Tamil Government in 1969) in its report of 1971

recommended for the abolition of IAS and IPS.

**Violates Ministerial Responsibility** These Services violates the principle of ministerial responsibility at the state level. The ministers in the states have to work with the aid and advise of those civil servants (Secretaries) who are appointed and trained by the Central Government, which also enjoys the ultimate control over them.

**Unequal Representation** The states of Indian Union are not equally represented in these Services. The states of the Punjab, UP, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh are represented more than others. Thus they lack the national character due to regional loyalties.

**Financial Burden** These Services involve larger expenditure on state governments due to high salary scales. This is done to attract the best talent from all over the country and to maintain their efficiency.

**Demoralises State Services** The service conditions of All-India Services including pay and promotional avenues are very favourable compared to the State Services. Also, the members of State Services are made to work under the officers of All-India Services. All this demoralises the State Services.

**No Familiarity** The members of the All-India Services who come from outside the state may not be familiar with the local language, culture and general environment. Hence, they cannot understand the problems of the people properly.

**Disadvantageous to Sons of the Soil** The continuation and creation of new All-India Services hampers the effective spread of State Services. They reduce employment opportunities for the local people, that is, 'Sons of the Soil'. This theory of the 'Sons of the Soil' is an offshoot of growing regionalism in our country.

**Lacks Specialisation** The All-India Services, especially IAS, do not facilitate specialisation which is so essential in the modern age. It is said that the IAS officers are 'Jack of all trades but master of none'. This point is also recognised by the Administrative Reforms Commission (1966–1970) of India which recommended that a functional field should be carved out for the IAS.

## **RECRUITMENT TO HIGHER SERVICES**

### **System of Recruitment**

The present system of recruitment to All-India Services and higher Central Services in our country is based on the recommendations made by the following committees.

- (i) The Macauley Committee
- (ii) The Kothari Committee
- (iii) The Satish Chandra Committee
- (iv) The Khanna Committee
- (v) The Nigavekar Committee
It must also be mentioned here that the Alagh Committee (2000–2001), the Hota Committee (2004) and the Second Administrative Reforms Commission (2005–2009) have also reviewed the system of recruitment to All-India Services and higher Central Services and suggested various changes.

The report of the Macaulay Committee on the Indian civil service laid down the basic policy governing recruitment to civil service for the first time in 1854. The most important aspects of this policy were the system of open competition and the scholastic nature of the examination.

The present scheme of examination to test the merit and suitability of candidates for direct recruitment to the All-India Services and higher Central Services is laid down by the Kothari Committee and the Satish Chandra Committee. However, the basic policy laid down, and the philosophy of recruitment advocated by the Macaulay Committee continues to influence the system.

The Committee on Recruitment Policy and Selection Methods under the Chairmanship of D.S. Kothari was appointed by the UPSC in 1974. It submitted its report in 1976. The Government accepted most of its recommendations in 1978 and implemented them in 1979. Thus the new system of competitive examination came into existence in 1979. Only in 1993, some changes were introduced in this system on the recommendations of the Satish Chandra Committee.

The Committee on the Recruitment Policy and Selection Methods for All-India and Central Services under the Chairmanship of Satish Chandra was appointed by UPSC in 1988. It submitted its report in 1989. The Government implemented some of its recommendations in 1993. The main changes effected are the introduction of an essay paper carrying 200 marks and increase in the marks for the interview test from 250 to 300.

In 2011, the UPSC changed the pattern and syllabus of the Civil Services Preliminary Examination. In the old scheme (before 2011), there was one paper of General Studies which carried 150 marks and a second paper where the candidate had the option to choose from 23 optional papers, carrying 300 marks. Under the new and revised pattern, there are two common and compulsory papers of 200 marks each. In other words, the optional paper has been replaced with another General Studies paper. These changes were made on the basis of the recommendations of a Committee headed by S.K. Khanna, Ex-Vice Chairman of UGC. This Committee was constituted in 2010 to review the scheme of Civil Services Preliminary Examination and suggest necessary changes.

Subsequently, the UPSC formed another Committee (in 2011) under the Chairmanship of Arun S. Nigavekar, Ex-Chairman of UGC, to review the scheme of Civil Services Main Examination and suggest necessary changes. The terms of reference of the Committee were as follows:

- 1. To identify the desired profile including the skill sets for the Civil Servants to enable them to deliver good governance in the fast changing domestic and global socio-economic and technological scenario.
- 2. To study the various selection methods currently in vogue globally for selection of Civil Servants.
- 3. To propose appropriate mechanisms and methodologies for selecting candidates with desired profile and skill sets indicated in (i) above suited to Indian context for the next decade.
- 4. To recommend a system for evaluation of the effectiveness of selection methodology adopted by the Commission and the periodicity in which corrective action, if any, may be made in the selection methodology; for ensuring that it keeps pace with the changing requirements of the Services.
- 5. To recommend the role of the Commission in the assessment of performance of the candidates recommended by it during and at the end of the mandatory training period and in particular, where such assessments have the effect of altering the initial merit order recommended by the

Commission as also where it is proposed to extend or terminate the probation of a direct recruit on the basis of unsuitability for Civil Service.

6. Any other issue which the Committee may feel relevant to the process of selection of Civil Servants for the country or which may be referred to the Committee by the Commission.

The Nigavekar Committee submitted its report in 2012. Based on these recommendations, the UPSC introduced changes in the scheme of Civil Services Main Examination from the year 2013. In the new and revised format, the weightage of General Studies has been increased and one optional subject (consisting of two papers) has been dropped. In effect, there are now four General Studies papers and only one optional subject (with two papers).

#### **Scheme of Examination**

The Competitive examination conducted by the UPSC for direct recruitment to All India Services and higher Central Services is known as the 'Civil Services Examination'. Its salient features are:

**Single Examination** The civil services examination is a single and combined examination for recruitment to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), Indian Foreign Service (IFS) and the other higher Central Services (i.e. Group A and Group B). Before 1979, there used to be three separate examinations, one for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Foreign Service (IFS), another for the Indian Police Service (IPS) and the Class II Police Services of the Union Territories and a third one for the Central Services.

**Nationality** For both, IAS and IPS, a candidate must be a citizen of India.

For other services, a candidate must be either a citizen of India or a subject of Nepal or a subject of Bhutan or a Tibetan refugee who came to India before 1962 with the intention of permanently settling in India or a person of Indian origin who has migrated from Pakistan, Burma, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Uganda,Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Zaire, Ethiopia and Vietnam with the intention of permanently settling in India. However, candidates belonging to these categories except the first one (i.e. a citizen of India) and the last one (i.e. migration) are not eligible for appointment to the Indian Foreign Service.

**Age Limits** A candidate must be a minimum of 21 years and a maximum of 32 years of age. However, the upper age limit is relaxable for the SC/ST candidates by five years and for the OBC candidates by three years. It must also be mentioned here that the age limit recommended by the Kothari Committee was 21–26 years.

**Educational Qualifications** A candidate must hold a degree from any of the universities incorporated by an Act of the central or state Legislature in India or other educational institutions established by an Act of Parliament or declared to be deemed as a university under the University Grants Commission Act of 1956 or must possess an equivalent qualification (i.e. professional or technical degree).

**Number of Attempts** Every candidate is permitted six attempts at the examination. But the number of attempts permitted to OBC candidates is nine. Further, the restriction on the number of attempts is not applicable to the SC/ST candidates. Thus, the SC/ST candidates can have any number of attempts within the prescribed age limits, that is, 21 to 37 years. It must also be noted here that the Kothari Committee had recommended only two attempts for both, the General and the SC/ST candidates.

**Plan of Examination** The Civil Services Examination consists of two successive stages called the Preliminary Examination and the Main Examination. The Preliminary Examination is meant for the selection of candidates for the Main Examination, while the Main Examination is meant for the selection of candidates for various services and posts.

**Preliminary Examination** It consists of two papers. They are:

| Paper I  | General Studies | 200 Marks |  |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|--|
| Paper II | General Studies | 200 Marks |  |
|          | Total           | 400 Marks |  |

Both the question papers are of objective type (i.e. multiple choice questions). The question papers are set both in Hindi and English. Each paper is of two hours' duration. However, the marks secured in this examination are not counted for the final ranking of the candidate. It is meant to serve as a screening test only.

**Main Examination** It consists of two parts—written examination and interview test. The written examination consists of the following papers:

| $Paper - A$   | Indian Language                   | 300 Marks  |  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|------------|--|
| $Paper - B$   | English                           | 300 Marks  |  |
| $Paper - I$   | Essay                             | 250 Marks  |  |
| $Paper - II$  | General Studies-I                 | 250 Marks  |  |
| $Paper - III$ | General Studies-II                | 250 Marks  |  |
| $Paper - IV$  | General Studies-III               | 250 Marks  |  |
| $Paper - V$   | <b>General Studies-IV</b>         | 250 Marks  |  |
| $Paper - VI$  | Optional Subject (Paper-1)        | 250 Marks  |  |
| $Paper - VII$ | Optional Subject (Paper-2)        | 250 Marks  |  |
|               | Sub-Total (written test)          | 2350 Marks |  |
|               | Interview Test (Personality Test) | 275 Marks  |  |
|               | <b>Grand Total</b>                | 2625 Marks |  |
|               |                                   |            |  |

The marks obtained in Indian Language and English papers are not counted for ranking. Also, Indian Language paper is not compulsory for the candidates hailing from the state of Sikkim and the north eastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland. The question papers for all the subjects for written examination are of conventional (essay) type. Each paper is of three hours' duration. The candidates can answer all the question papers except the language papers (i.e. Paper-A and Paper-B) in any one of the languages mentioned in the Eight Schedule of the Constitution of India, or in English. However, all the question papers (other than language papers) are set only in Hindi and English.

**Interview Test** It aims at assessing personal suitability of the applicant for a career in civil services. The qualities judged by an interview test includes mental alertness, critical powers of assimilation, clear and logical exposition, balance of judgement, variety and depth of interest, ability for social cohesion and leadership, and intellectual and moral integrity.

It should be noted here that A.D. Gorwala (in his Report on Public Administration–1951) advocated the need for psychological tests in the method of recruitment to the higher civil services in India.

**Selection of Candidates** The marks secured by candidates in the written examination (i.e. essay, general studies and optional subject, totalling to 1750 marks) and the interview test (275 marks) would determine their final ranking. The candidates are alloted various services keeping in view their ranks in the Main Examination. Of course, the preferences expressed by the candidates for various services are also considered.

In addition to the Preliminary and Main Examinations, the Kothari Commission had also recommended another level (i.e. a third level) of examination called Post-Training Test. It suggested that there should be a post-training test on completion of training at the LBS National Academy of Administration, Mussorie. The allocation of candidates to various services should be made on the basis of marks obtained by them in both the Main Examination and the Post-Training Test. However, the government rejected this recommendation on the ground that this would involve reorganisation of the LBS National Academy of Administration.

The UPSC submits the list of the successful candidates arranged in the order of merit to the Ministry of Personnel. The Ministry of External Affairs gets the first choice to choose the required quota for the Indian Foreign Service (IFS). After that, the Ministry of Personnel selects the candidates for the IAS. Then, the candidates for the IPS are choosen by the Ministry of Home Affairs. This is followed by other ministries/departments in a fixed order.

It is important to mention here that the combined competitive examination described above does not cover the Indian Forest Service (IFS), which is also an All-India Service. For this, the UPSC conducts a separate examination which consists of a written test and an interview test.

Apart from this direct recruitment, a method of recruitment by promotion is also followed. The All-India Services Act of 1951 specifies that senior duty posts not exceeding  $33<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>$  per cent in the Indian Administrative Services (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFS), are required to be filled in by promotion of officers employed in the State Services. Such promotions are made on the recommendations of the Selection Committee constituted for this purpose in each state. Each such Committee is presided over by the Chairman or a member of UPSC.

Therefore, the IAS—the top most All-India Service—consists of officers recruited by the following three methods:

- (i) By direct recruitment through a combined, open, competitive Civil Services examination.
- (ii) By indirect recruitment, that is, promotion of officers of State Civil Services.
- (iii) By special selections from those holding gazetted posts under state governments but who are not members of the State Administrative Services.

# **TRAINING OF CIVIL SERVANTS**

### **Training of IAS**

Before the Independence, the Indian Civil Service (ICS) probationers were given general training in four British Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, London and Dublin for a period of one to two years. During the Second World War, when it was not possible to do so, a temporary training camp was

organised at Dehra Dun.

After the Independence, the ICS was converted into the IAS, and IAS Training School was set up in 1947 at the Metcalfe House in Delhi. It provided one year multi-purpose training to the IAS probationers. In 1957, the IAS Staff College was established at Simla to provide a refresher training course for senior IAS officers of six to ten years'service. Both these training institutions of Delhi and Simla were merged in 1959 to set up the National Academy of Administration at Mussoorie. Since then, this academy has been imparting training to the IAS probationers.

The various components of the induction training programme for IAS are:

| (i) Foundational training                 | 4 Months  |  |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------|--|
| (ii) Professional training (first spell)  | 5 Months  |  |
| (iii) District training in the state      | 12 Months |  |
| (iv) Professional training (second spell) | 3 Months  |  |
| Total                                     | 24 Months |  |

The foundational training course organised by the National Academy is a combined training course for the new entrants (called probationers) of All India Services, that is, IAS, IPS and IFS (Indian Forest Service) and Central Services Group A (including Indian Foreign Service), except the Central Secretariat Service. This combined course under a comon roof is imparted with the following objectives.

- (i) To develop a feeling of belongingness ( *esprit de corps*) and a broad common outlook among the members of the higher civil services.
- (ii) To provide an understanding of the constitutional, economic, social, political, legal, administrative, historical and cultural context within which the administrators have to function and make their contributions.
- (iii) To inculcate professional, administrative and human values among the probationers.

After the completion of the foundational course, the probationers of other services are sent to their respective training institutes for professional training, while the IAS probationers continue to stay at the Academy for their professional training (also called institutional training). In 1969, professional training programme for the IAS probationers underwent a change with the introduction of a 'sandwich' course on the recommendation of the ARC. Since then, the IAS probationers are required to undergo two spells of professional (institutional) training at the Academy with a gap of one year between them.This gap is utilised for district training (i.e. field training or practical training) in the states.

During the first spell of institutional training, the IAS probationers study in more detail the problems of Indian administration, district administration, Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code, constitutional and legal system, economic planning, and others. After this, they are sent to their allotted state for field training. The posting of an IAS probationer in the state is decited by the Chief Secretary of the state government. The components of this training are mentioned below.

- (i) Institutional training at the state training school
- (ii) Practical training in the district under the supervision of a Collector
- (iii) Training at the State Secretariat

At the end of this one year field training in the state, the probationers return to the National Academy to undergo a second spell of the professional training. At this stage, the probationers focus on the discussion of administrative problems and issues they were confronted with or they observed during the course of their practical training in the state. The training at this stage is more problemoriented. At the end of this training, the probationer has to pass an examination conducted by the UPSC. He now becomes an officer and is sent to the allotted state.

#### **Training of IPS**

The various components of the induction training programme for IPS are:

| (i) Foundational training                 | 4 Months  |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------|
| (ii) Professional training (first spell)  | 12 Months |
| (iii) District training in the States     | 8 Months  |
| (iv) Professional training (second spell) | 3 Months  |
| Total                                     | 27 Months |

The foundational training to the IPS probationers is imparted at the LBS National Academy of Administration (Mussoorie), alongwith the probationers of other All-India and Central Services.

After the completion of the combined foundational course, the IPS probationers are sent to the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (Hyderabad) for professional training (i.e. institutional training). In 1986, the professional training programme for the IPS probationers underwent a change with the introduction of a 'sandwich' course on the recommendations of the Gore Committee on Police Training of 1974. It is patterned on the lines of sandwich course for IAS probationers. Therefore since 1986, the IPS probationers are also required to undergo two spells of institutional (professional) training at the National Police Academy (Hyderabad) with a gap of eight months (35 weeks) between them. This gap is utilised for district training (i.e. field training or practical training) in the states.

### **Training of IFS (Forest)**

The Indian Forest Service (IFS) probationers are given the induction training for a period of three years. The various components of this training programme along with the respective durations are mentioned below:

| (i) Foundational training                 | 4 months  |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------|
| (ii) Professional training                | 24 months |
| (iii) On-the-job training in cadre states | 8 months  |
| Total                                     | 36 months |

The foundational training to the IFS probationers is imparted at the LBS National Academy of Administration (Mussoorie), along with the probationers of other All-India and Central Services. After this, they are sent to the Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (Dehradun) for professional training.

# **Training of IFS (Foreign)**

The duration of training imparted for the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) probationers is three years. The various components of their training programme alongwith the respective durations are mentioned as follows.

| (1)  | Foundational course imparted at National Academy of                   | 4 months  |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
|      | Administration, Mussoorie (alongwith other probationers of            |           |
|      | All-India and Central Services)                                       |           |
| (11) | Professional Course at the Foreign Service Institute in New 12 months |           |
|      | Delhi (including an Attachment with the Armed Forces and              |           |
|      | Bharat Darshan tour)                                                  |           |
|      | (iii) Attachment with the Ministry of External Affairs                | 6 months  |
|      | (iv) Languages training at an Indian mission abroad                   | 14 months |
|      | Total                                                                 | 36 Months |

The above system of induction training for IFS Probationers has been in force since 1987. Before that, the training system consisted of seven stages with an element of district training for six months duration. The probationers were given institutional training at Indian School of International Studies in New Delhi. This institute was replaced by the Foreign Service Institute.

#### **Training of Other Higher Services**

After completion of 4 months' combined foundational course at Mussoorie, the probationers of various higher civil services are sent to their respective training institutes for professional (institutional) training. The following points can be noted in this regard.

- (i) The Indian Audit and Accounts Service probationers are imparted professional training at the Indian Audit and Accounts Service Staff Training College, Simla.
- (ii) The Income Tax Service probationers are given professional training at the Indian Revenue Service (Direct Taxes) Training Institute, Nagpur.
- (iii) Railway Services probationers are trained at the Railway Staff College, Baroda.

# **PAY AND SERVICE CONDITIONS**

The conditions of service of a government servant includes pay, allowances, periodical increments, leave, promotion, tenure or termination of service, transfer, deputation, various types of rights, disciplinary action, holidays, hours of work, and retirement benefits like pension, provident fund, gratuity, and so on. Thus, it includes the whole gamut of personnel administration except classification, recruitment and training.

# **Pay (Compensation)**

Pay is also known as salary or compensation or remuneration. A sound and adequate compensation plan is very essential for the efficient functioning of the civil service in the modern state. However, there is no single principle which determines the fixation of the pay scales of civil servants. In fact, various principles are considered while fixing the salary scales.

**Equal Pay for Equal Work** This is the most important principle involved in the determination of

salary scales for civil servants. There should be uniform pay rates without any individual variations based on favouritism. In other words, the pay scale should compensate the positions (jobs) and not the individuals. Hence, higher kind of work should be paid a higher rate than the lower kind of work.

**Parity with Outside Employment** The pay scales of the government servants should be fairly comparable to the pay scales in the private sector. In other words, the government employees should be paid at a rate which corresponds to the comparable situation in outside employment. Otherwise, the talent in society will join the private sector.

**Cost of Living** The salaries paid to the government employees must be both adequate and just. They should have relationship with the cost of living. However, the cost of living is not the same throughout the country and varies from region to region. Such regional variations should be taken into consideration while fixing the pay scale of the employees. Further, the pay scales should be revised and adjusted to the changes in the cost of living.

**Economic Position of the Country** The compensation plan of the government for its employees should bear relationship with the per capita income of the country. This is because, the financial position of the government depends on the economic situation of the country. In developed countries like USA, UK, France and Germany, the tax paying capacity of people is much higher when compared to those of the developing countries like India, Brazil, and so on. Obviously the pay scales of public servants in developed countries are much higher when compared to the pay scales in the developing countries.

**State as the Model Employer** Another principle which should be taken into account while determining the pay scales of government employees is that the state should act as the model employer. The Tomlin Royal Commission (1929–31) on the civil service in Britain has mentioned the following three different interpretations of the term model employer.

- (i) An employer who is ahead of other employers in the society in the matters of pay and other conditions of service.
- (ii) The State should be one of the front rank employers in the society, it need not march ahead of them.
- (iii) It only emphasises the responsibility of the state towards its employees and nothing beyond that.

The general interpretation of the term is the first one. Therefore, the State should have such pay scales for its employees which might serve as the model for the private sector employers.

**Maintenance of Efficiency** The pay scales of the government should be so designed as to attract and retain efficient staff with requisite qualifications and abilities. Anderson Committee (1923) on the pay and service conditions of state servants in Britain emphasised this principle. It propounded the theory that "the government should pay what is necessary to recruit and retain an efficient staff." Islington Commission (1912) in India also justified this principle.

**Other Principles** Apart from the above principles, the following factors are also taken into consideration while fixing the pay scales.

(i) Social considerations, that is, the disparities between the highest and the lowest salaries should be minimum.

- (ii) The policy of the Government which is based on the political ideology professed and practised by it.
- (iii) Legislations like Minimum Wages Act.
- (iv) The risky and hazardous nature of job.
- (v) The employees union which pressurise the Government through their principle of collective bargaining.

#### **Allowances**

Apart from pay, the government servants are entitled to receive many types of allowances. These are explained below.

**Dearness Allowance (DA)** It is granted to compensate the increase in prices and the cost of living.

**House Rent Allowance (HRA)** It is granted to compensate for the rising rent of the house in cities.

**Compensatory City Allowance** It is granted to meet the necessities of everyday life in big cities which cost more when compared to the smaller cities/towns.

**Travelling Allowance (TA)** It is granted to meet the expenses incurred on travel undertaken on official duty.

**Daily Allowance (DA)** It is granted to meet the daily expenses incurred on boarding, lodging and sundry items while on tour.

**Conveyance Allowance (CA)** It is provided to an employee who is required to travel extensively at or within a short distance from his headquarters but cannot claim travelling allowance.

**Leave Travel Concession (LTC)** It is granted to an employee to enable him or his family members to visit his or their home town once in a block of two calendar years.

**Medical Aid** The government employee and his family members are entitled for free of charge medical attendance and treatment.

**Children's Educational Assistance** The benefits extended to government employees under this category includes:

- (a) Children's educational allowance,
- (b) Reimbursement of tuition fees, and
- (c) Hostel subsidy.

**Uniform Allowance** Certain categories of employees like police, peons have to wear special uniforms while performing their official duties. They are granted special uniform allowance.

**Compensatory Allowances** This includes the composite hill compensatory allowance, bad climate allowance, tribal area allowance and remote locality/border area/difficult area/disturbed area allowance.

**Other Allowances** Apart from the above-mentioned allowances and perks, government employees also enjoy other allowances like project construction allowance, risk allowance, cyclone allowance, washing allowance, overtime allowance, and others.

#### **Leave Benefits**

The government employees also enjoy the benefit of various kinds of leave. However, leave cannot be claimed as a matter of right. In other words, the leave sanctioning authority can refuse or revoke leave of any kind. But it is not open to him (i.e. the leave sanctioning authority) to alter the kind of leave due and applied for except at the request of the employee. Further, no leave of any kind can be granted for a continuous period exceeding five years except with the sanction of the President. The various kinds of leave are explained below:

**Casual Leave** It is essentially intended for short periods to meet unexpected contingencies. An employee on casual leave is not treated as absent from duty. His pay is not intermitted.

**Earned Leave** It is also known as privilege leave. It is intended to enable the employee to take rest for a certain period. The earned leave can be accumulated and encashed at the time of retirement.

**Half-Pay Leave** This leave is granted on option even when earned leave is at credit. It is granted either on medical certificate or on private affairs. Thus, this leave is also called as sick leave and leave on private affairs.

**Study Leave** It is granted to an employee for undergoing a special course consisting of higher studies or specialised training in a professional or technical subject having a direct and close relationship with the sphere of his duties.

**Maternity Leave** This leave is granted to married or unmarried female employees with less than two surviving children. It carries full pay.

**Paternity Leave** This is granted to male government servants with less than two surviving children for a period of 15 days during the confinement of his wife. It carries full pay.

**Extraordinary Leave** This is granted when no other leave is admissible or when other leave is admissible but the employee applies specifically for the grant of this leave. It cannot be granted for

more than five years in case of permanent officials. However, he will not be entitled to any leave salary.

**Other Leaves** Apart from the leaves mentioned above, government servants are also entitled for commuted leave, special disability leave, hospital leave, special casual leave and others.

### **Promotion**

The following points can be noted with regard to the promotion system in our country.

- (i) The seniority-cum-merit is the governing principle.
- (ii) Head of the department concerned is the promotion making authority. However, promotions to higher posts are made in consultation with the public service commissions.
- (iii) Departmental Promotion Committees (or Boards) are set up for the purpose of selecting the candidates for promotion at the departmental levels.
- (iv) The All-India Services Act of 1951 specifies that the senior posts not exceeding per cent in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFS) are required to be filled in by promotion of officers employed in the State Services. Such promotions are made on the recommendation of selection committees constituted for this purpose in each state. Such a committee is presided over by the Chairman or a member of UPSC.
- (v) The employees are rated under the following five categories for the purpose of promotion:
  - **Outstanding**
  - $\blacksquare$ Very good
  - $\blacksquare$ Satisfactory
  - $\blacksquare$ Indifferent
  - $\blacksquare$ Poor
- (vi) An employee who is appointed through promotion cannot be removed or dismissed by any authority which is subordinate to the authority by which he was appointed or promoted (Article 311 of the Constitution).
- (vii) The principle of seniority was accepted first in India by the East India Company in 1669. The Charter Act of 1793 sanctified it. The ICS Act of 1861 made allowance for merit principle also.

# **Retirement Benefits**

There are three methods of raising the funds out of which the retirement benefits are paid. These are given below.

- (i) Contributory system, in which the employee makes total contribution (by way of salary deductions).
- (ii) Partly contributory system in which both, the employee and the government share the cost of retirement benefits.
- (iii) Non-contributory system in which the government alone bears the cost of retirement benefits.

The following forms of retirement benefits are in vogue in India.

**Pension** It is a recurring monthly payment granted to the retired government servants so long as they live. The various kinds of pension are as follows.

- (i) Superannuation pension, granted to a public servant who retires after attaining the age of superannuation, that is, 58 years or 60 years.
- (ii) Retiring pension, granted to a public servant who retires after completing the fixed period of service but before attaining the age of superannuation (i.e. voluntary retirement or premature retirement).
- (iii) Invalid pension, granted to a public servant who retires on account of any bodily or mental infirmity which permanently incapacitates him for any further service.
- (iv) Compensation pension, granted to a public servant whose permanent post is abolished and the provision of alternate employment of equal status is not possible, or offer of a lower post is not accepted.
- (v) Compulsory retirement pension, granted to a public servant who is compulsorily retired from service as a measure of penalty.
- (vi) Compassionate allowance, granted to a public servant who is removed or dismissed from service for misconduct. This is also considered as pension but the amount should not exceed two-thirds of pension which would have been admissible to him if he had retired on compensation pension.
- (vii) Injury Pension, granted to a public servant for injury sustained in the course of discharging his official duties. It is also known as disability pension.
- (viii) Family Pension, granted to the family of a public servant on his death in service or after retirement.

**Provident Fund** It is another form of retirement benefit which is paid to the employee in a lumpsum at one instance. It is a partly contributory system of retirement benefit in the sense that the contribution to the fund is made both by the employee and the Government.

**Gratuity** It is paid to a public servant at the time of retirement in a lumpsum at one time. It is of various kinds, *viz*. service gratuity, retirement gratuity, death gratuity, and so on.

**Leave Encashment** The retired employee can encash his accumulated earned leave at the time of retirment. Thus the employee is granted a lumpsum cash equivalent to the leave salary.

**Insurance Benefits** The Central Government Employees' Group Insurance Scheme of 1980 provides, at a low cost and on contributory and self-financing basis, the twin benefits of an insurance cover in the event of the employee's death during his service, and a lumpsum payment to augment their resources on retirement.

### **Rights of Civil Servants**

The rights of civil servants in India are:

**Right to Organise** The Constitution of India (Article 19) gave all the citizens the fundamental right to freedom of speech, expression, assembly and association. However, it authorised the state to impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of these rights in the national interest.

Further, the Constitution (Article 309) also empowered the legislature to regulate the recruitment

and service conditions of persons appointed to public services and posts. The conduct rules made under this provision also impose reasonable restrictions on the fundamental rights of civil servants.

Therefore, the position in India is that the civil servants cannot become members of any service association which is not recognised by the Government. Thus joining an unrecognised association is a disciplinary offence.

**Right to Strike** Like in the UK, in India also there is no law prohibiting a strike by civil servants. However, the conduct rules prohibit a civil servant from participating in any strike. Hence striking by civil servants constitute a disciplinary offence. Jagannath Das Commission (i.e. the Second Pay Commission) said that the civil servants should not enjoy the right to strike. The Administrative Reforms Commission of India went one step ahead and recommended complete ban on strikes by civil servants.

**Political Rights** Like the USA, India has also imposed severe restrictions on political rights of the civil servants. According to the conduct rules, the civil servants:

- (i) should not indulge in active politics.
- (ii) should not join any political party.
- (iii) should not canvass in favour of any candidate.
- (iv) should not contest Lok Sabha or state assembly elections.
- (v) should not aid any political movement.

Thus, except the right to vote, the civil servants in India do not enjoy any other political rights. However, a civil servant can contest in a local election with the permission of the Government.

**Machinery for Consultation** Staff Committees were established in all central ministries in 1954 on the recommendation of the First Pay Commission. These were renamed as Staff Councils in 1957.

The aims and objectives of these councils were as follows:

- (i) To provide a machinery for dealing with the grievances of the employees.
- (ii) To negotiate and settle the disputes related to conditions of service between the Government and the employees.
- (iii) To ensure maximum cooperation between the Government and its employees.
- (iv) To improve efficiency in the public service.
- (v) To promote welfare of the employees.

Every ministry had two Staff Councils namely, a Senior Staff Council for Class II and Class III employees, and a Junior Staff Council for Class IV employees. Thus, Class I employees were excluded from this scheme. They were only advisory.

The Second Pay Commission found that these councils were not effective in fulfilling their objectives. Hence, it recommended the following measures.

- (i) A central joint council should be established and it should cover both the industrial and nonindustrial civil service.
- (ii) A compulsory arbitration tribunal should be set up to deal with matters of pay and allowances, hours of work and leave.
- (iii) The Ministry of Labour should play an important role in matters pertaining to staff relations.

The above recommendations were implemented in 1966 when the machinery for joint consultation and compulsory arbitration for Central Government employees was established.

The Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM) is patterned on the Whitley Council in the UK. It consists of the national council, the departmental councils and the local councils. The council has equal number of both, official as well as staff representatives.

The JCM is concerned with the following:

- (i) General principles related to recruitment, promotion and discipline.
- (ii) All matters pertaining to conditions of service.
- (iii) Improvement of efficiency in public service.
- (iv) Welfare of the employees.

It does not entertain the discussion of individual cases.

The JCM includes all civil servants except the following:

- Group A (i.e. Class I) Officers
- $\blacksquare$ Group B (i.e. Class II) Services except the Central Secretariat Service
- $\blacksquare$ Persons employed in industrial establishment at the managerial or supervisory level
- П Employees of union territories
- $\blacksquare$ Police Personnel

There is also a provision for compulsory arbitration in case of disagreement between the official and the staff. For this purpose, Board of Arbitration under the control of the Ministry of Labour has been established. The awards of the Board are final, subject to the over-riding authority of the Parliament of India.

## **Disciplinary Action**

Disciplinary action is taken against a civil servant who has violated the conduct rules in the performance of his job. The important conduct rules in India are:

- All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1954.
- $\blacksquare$ Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1955.
- $\blacksquare$ Railway Services (Conduct) Rules, 1956.

A formal disciplinary action constitutes the imposition of minor as well as major penalities. The following are the minor penalities.

- Censure or reprimand
- $\blacksquare$ Withholding increments
- $\blacksquare$ Withholding promotion
- П Recovery of pecuniary loss

The following are the major penalities:

- П Reduction to lower scale or rank
- П Compulsory retirement
- $\blacksquare$ Removal from service
- $\blacksquare$ Dismissal from service

The difference between removal and dismissal is that the former shall not disqualify for future employment, while the latter shall disqualify for future employment.

The various steps in the process of disciplinary action are:

(i) Calling for an explanation from the employee against whom disciplinary action is initiated.

- (ii) Framing of charges, if the explanation is not satisfactory.
- (iii) Suspension of the employee from the service.
- (iv) Hearing of charges and giving opportunity to the employee to defend himself.
- (v) Findings and making report.
- (vi) Giving second opportunity to the employee to defend himself against the proposed punishment.
- (vii) Punishment order (exoneration).
- (viii) Appeal, if any.

The following constitutional provisions govern the proceedings of the disciplinary action against a civil servant.

- (i) A civil servant cannot be removed or dismissed by any authority subordinate to the authority by which he was appointed (Article 311).
- (ii) A civil servant cannot be reduced in rank or removed or dismissed unless he is given reasonable opportunity to defend himself (Article 311).

The President of India is the disciplinary authority in respect of All India Services, Central Services Class I (i.e. Group A) and some Class II (i.e. Group B) services.

In respect to class III (i.e. Group C) and Class IV (i.e. Group D) employees, the Secretary of the ministry concerned is the disciplinary authority.

## **GENERALISTS AND SPECIALISTS IN CIVIL SERVICE**

Generalists and specialists are the two components of the civil service in India. The proper relationship between the two is essential for the efficient functioning of the civil service. However, there has been an unending controversy between these two since the British rule.

## **Meaning**

A generalist civil servant is one who does not possess a specialised background but is well equipped with the administrative procedures, rules and regulations and hence, can be appointed in any field of administration. He belongs to the managerial class and usually performs the POSDCORB functions, that is, Planning, Organising, Staffing, Directing, Coordinating, Reporting and Budgeting. Thus, the civil servants who make policies, coordinate, supervise and control the administration are called generalists. An IAS officer is an example of a generalist civil servant par excellence.

A specialist civil servant, on the other hand, is one who possesses special knowledge or skill in a specific field or area of administration. He is an expert professional. Thus, like a generalist, he is not an all-rounder. Engineers, doctors, agriculturists, meteorologists, educationists and statisticians are some of the examples of specialists.

## **Categorisation of Services**

The civil services in India can be grouped into two broad categories viz. technical services and nontechnical services. The technical services are those to which recruitment is done only on the basis of specialised and professional qualifications of the candidates. These services include Indian Economic Service, Indian Statistical Service, Indian Forest Service, Central Engineering Service, Central Legal Service, Central Health Service, Indian Meteorological Service, and so on. These technical services are called 'Specialist Services' and the members of these services are called the 'Specialists.'

The non-technical services, on the other hand, are those to which recruitment is done on the basis of general educational qualifications and is open to all candidates who possess the minimum required educational qualification, for instance, a university degree. These services includes Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, Indian Revenue Service, Indian Foreign Service, Indian Audit and Accounts Service, Indian Postal Service, Central Secretariat Service, and so on. These non-techcnical services can be further divided into two sub-categories, that is, functional services and general purpose service. The members of the functional services remain in the specific field of administration for which they are selected and appointed throughout their career. In the course of time, they acquire expert and specialised knowledge due to work experience and regular training. These functional services include all the nontechnical services except the IAS. The IAS is the only general purpose service at the national level. The members of IAS occupy top positions in the administrative heirarchy in various fields of administration. There is no functional field carved out for the members of IAS.

To sum up, the specialists class include the members of the technical services and the nontechnical functional services, and the generalists class includes the members of only the IAS. Thus the generalists and the specialists controversy is nothing but the controversy between the members of the IAS and the non-IAS.

#### **Historical Perspective**

The origin of the generalists and specialists dichotomy can be traced to the British Northcote-Trevelyan Committee Report of 1854. This Committee recommended a superior position for the members of the British Administrative Class (generalists) and subordinate position for the members of the technical (specialists) services. The Macaulay Committee Report of 1854 on the Indian Civil Service was influenced by the British Northcote-Trevelyan Committee Report and recommended the same position in India too.

Hence, the administrative machinery in India during the British colonial rule was structured and designed to give a dominant position to the members of the generalist services, especially the ICS. Even after independence, there has been no significant change in this pattern of administration.

In Britain, the Fulton Committee Report of 1968 examined this matter in the changed conditions and recommended a better status and greater role for the specialists, and professionalisation of higher civil service. However, the generalist dominance continues to prevail in Britain with marginal improvement in the status of the specialists. Similarly in India also, the Second Pay Commission (1957–1959), the Estimates Committee of Parliament and the Administrative Reforms Commission (1966–70) recommended for remedial measures to give better status to the specialists. However, the situation has not changed much and the old system still continues, of course, with little change.

#### **Areas of Controversy**
The following points give an account of the present position with regard to the respective roles and status of the generalists and the specialists in the administrative system. In other words, the generalists and specialists controversy is surrounded around the following points.

- (i) The pay and service conditions (including promotion) of the generalists are more attractive and favourable than those of the specialists. This is the foremost grievance of the specialists.
- (ii) The majority of top posts (i.e. policy formulation and consideration levels) in the Union and state governments are reserved for the members of IAS. In other words, entry into these top posts is usually denied to the specialists.
- (iii) Below the Secretariat level, the positions are usually manned by specialists. But many a times, generalists are appointed as heads of the executive departments for example, Director of Agriculture, Chief Conservator of Forests, Director of Health, and so on.
- (iv) At the regional level, the key posts like Divisional Commissioner, Command Area Development Commissioner, and others, are manned by generalists.
- (v) At the district level, the District Collector, who is head of the district administration is a 'generalist civil servant par excellence'. A district administration consists of a number of technical departments which are headed by the specialists. Even the Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla Parishad is a generalist and heads a team of specialists.
- (vi) The proximity to the political bosses which is enjoyed by the generalists is much more than the specialists.
- (vii) Inter-organisational mobility of generalists is much wider than that of specialists. The IAS officers move from one department to another, from a department to a public enterprise or local government and vice-versa. The specialists move only within their respective departments or fields of administration.
- (viii) The generalists have a greater and quicker chance of promotion than specialists.
- (ix) The performance appraisal and assessment of specialists is done by generalist IAS officers.
- (x) The advises, proposals and ideas of the specialists are not cared much by the IAS officers who consider the specialists as their subordinates.

The above points of controversy between the generalists and specialists have led to discontentment among specialists thereby affecting their morale and efficiency.

## **Case for Generalists**

The arguments put forward for the superiority of the generalists are:

- (i) The generalists are more suitable than specialists for the performance of higher management level jobs due to their high caliber, ability, and a wide and rich experience.
- (ii) The tenure system of Secretariat staffing which is based on the concept of district or field experience favours a band of generalist administrators.
- (iii) There should be a generalist civil servant at all levels of administration to perform the managerial functions, as the administration is historically based on the principle of 'area administration', that is, *taluqa,* district, division and so on.
- (iv) A generalist acts as a mediator between a amateur minister and the specialist, between the people and the government, and between the pressure groups and public interest.
- (v) The specialists are narrow-minded and parochial as they "know more and more about less and less." As rightly said by Paul H. Appleby, "the price of specialisation of every kind is

parochialism". The generalists, on the other hand, have a broad out look and flexibility of approach.

## **Case for Specialists**

The arguments put forward by the specialists in favour of their better position and greater role in administration are:

- (i) The generalists are not suitable for all policy-making positions as they do not have professionalism and adequate knowledge.
- (ii) Amateur generalists cannot understand the technical complexities of the proposals forwarded by the specialists. An IAS officer is "a jack of all trades but master of none."
- (iii) The 'intelligent amateur theory' underlying the constitution of the generalist civil service developed in Britain and India during the nineteenth century does not hold good in the present times as the functions of administration have become more complex, more technical and subject specific.
- (iv) In the present set up, a minister is deprived of expert advice and specialised knowledge of the specialists.
- (v) The policies formulated by the generalists are unrealistic as they are not fully aware of the problems faced by the specialists in the effective implementation of policies.

## **Forms of Organisation**

There are four forms of organisation of generalists and specialists. The nature of relationship between them depends on the type of the form being adopted. These are explained below.

**Separate Hierarchy** In this system, there will be common pay for the generalists and the specialists. However, the specialists will have greater respect. This form is prevalent in Germany, Sweden and Australia.

**Parallel Hierarchy** Under this system, a specialist will be working with a generalist. In other words, the specialists and the generalists will have their own respective hierarchies (which are parallel to each other). The coordinating work is achieved by frequent liaison between the two.

**Joint Hierarchy** Under this system, both a generalist bureaucrat and a specialist technocrat report jointly to their common superior, permanent secretary, who is a generalist. Similarly, a minister may also be advised by a Specialist as well as generalist.

**Unified Hierarchy** Under this system, there will be a unified (Integrated) civil service which is created by merging all the services and cadres. There will be a common open competitive examination for entry into such service and uniformity in pay and service conditions. Pakistan adopted this model in 1973. This idea is also under discussion in India whereby it is suggested that the Central Services and All India Services should be merged to create a unified civil service.

## **Steps Taken**

Since Independence, the Government of India has taken the following steps to resolve the generalist– specialist controversy:

- 1. It has created the Central Secretariat Service in 1948. This gave rise to a separate cadre of permanent secretariat officers.
- 2. It has established the Central Administrative Pool in 1957 for manning the higher positions in the Central Secretariat.
- 3. It has created the Indian Forest Service in 1966. It is a specialist All-India Service.
- 4. It has created the Indian Economic Service and Indian Statistical Service in 1961. These are the specialist central services.
- 5. It has been appointing specialists to the senior administrative positions like Secretary, Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary and so on.
- 6. It has been inducting specialists into the Board of Directors of the central public sector enterprises.
- 7. It has been appointing specialists to a majority of positions in the Planning Commission.

# **MINISTER–CIVIL SERVANT RELATIONSHIP**

#### **Meaning**

The Parliamentary form of government prevalent in India postulates the existence of both forms of executive— political executive and permanent executive. The political executive consists of the Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Ministers of State and Deputy Ministers. The permanent executive, on the other hand, consists of civil servants, that is, Secretaries, Additional Secretaries, Joint Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries and other professional administrators. The civil servants of a ministry/department are headed politically by a minister and administratively by a Secretary.

The political executive derives its power from the people through a mechanism of periodic elections, and exercises power by virtue of the constitutional position. The permanent executive, on the other hand, is selected on the basis of merit and derives its power from both administrative positions and the technical expertise. As the system of government is based on the doctrine of popular sovereignty (i.e. possession of supreme power by the people), the permanent executive is subordinated to the political executive which represents the people. In the words of Mohit Bhattacharya, "Under the parliamentary system of government, the superiority of the minister and the subordination of the Secretary are axiomatic."

#### **Relative Roles**

A proper and harmonious relationship between the minister (i.e. political or transient executive) and the secretary (i.e. civil servant or permanent executive) is of great importance for smooth and efficient functioning of the parliamentary government. A minister (i.e. non-official) is responsible for the following functions.

- (i) To formulate policies
- (ii) To make decisions on important matters
- (iii) To supervise the implementation of policies

- (iv) To decide on larger administrative questions
- (v) To make appointments to top posts
- (vi) To intervene in administration for the redressal of legitimate public grievance(s)

The Civil Servant (i.e. official), on the other hand, is responsible for the following functions.

- (i) To implement policies and decisions
- (ii) To provide information, facts and ethical judgements needed in policy making
- (iii) To direct and supervise the work of subordinates
- (iv) To maintain continuity of administration

Pfiffner has excellently enumerated the points of distinction between the political executive and the civil servant in the following way:

## **Principles**

The principles that govern relationship between the minister and the civil servant are:

- (i) Both should uphold the constitutional provisions and parliamentary laws while discharging their respective duties.
- (ii) A minister has the ultimate prerogative in policy-making.
- (iii) A civil servant should execute faithfully all policies and decisions of the minister even when they are against the advice tendered by him.
- (iv) A civil servant enjoys full freedom to express himself frankly without fear in tendering advice to the minister.
- (v) A civil servant should observe the principles of neutrality, impartiality and anonymity. Neutrality means that a civil servant should remain non-political and must serve different governments in power without any political consideration. Impartiality means that the civil servant should, in the words of Mohit Bhattacharya, "act without bias irrespective of the social pressures and variations in the nature of clients." Anonymity means that a civil servant must work from behind the curtain, without praise or blame.

### **Relationship in Practice**

The minister-civil servant relationship in India emerged as a result of the Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms. This Act was enforced in 1921 to introduce, among others, the new scheme of 'Dyarchy' (dual scheme of governance) in the provinces. Consequently, the office of minister came into existence, and for the first time, the ICS Officers were made to work under the ministers who were responsible to the Legislative Council.

In practice, the relationship between a minister and a Civil Servant is characterised by conflicts, disputes, uneasiness and suspicion. Let us examine some important cases here.

The first conflict in the relationship between a minister and a Civil Servant in the post-Independence era occurred in 1957 in the "Mundhra Deal." In this case, the funds amounting to rupees one crore and a quarter of the nationalised Life Insurance Corporation were spent to purchase the shares of a private concern. When it became a point of concern, both, the then Fianance Minister (T.T. Krishnamachari) and Principal Finance Secretary (H.M. Patel) blamed each other. Consequently, the Government of India appointed a one man inquiry commission consisting of M.C. Chagla to enquire and examine into the facts and propriety of the Mundhra deal in 1958. The Chagla Commission held in its report that "Constitutionally the minister is responsible for the action taken by his secretary... He cannot take shelter behind them nor can he disown their actions." Thus, the Chagla Commission upheld the principle of ministerial responsibility and the norm of anonymity of civil service. Consequently, the Finance Minister resigned.

Again in 1966, the then Home Minister (Gulzari Lal Nanda) complained to the Prime Minister of the non-cooperative attitude of his Home Secretary (L.P. Singh) and requested for his replacement. The Prime Minister did not consider the request and consequently Gulzari Lal Nanda resigned.

Another episode took place in 1971 when the Railway Minister (K. Hanumanthaiya) meted out a shabby treatment to the Chairman of the Railway Board (B.C. Ganguli). They had differences over a number of issues mainly related to railway financial administration. B.C. Ganguli left under humiliating circumstances as his services were terminated by the Government.

In 1987, Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of india, also misbehaved with the Agriculture Secretary (C.S. Sastry), Rural Development Secretary (D. Bandopadhyaya) and Foreign Secretary (A.P. Venkateshran).

In 1993, the Home Secretary resigned due to difference in the style of functioning of the Home Minister.

#### **Reasons for Conflicts**

The factors responsible for the deterioration of the relationship between a minister and a civil servant are:

- (i) The ministers generally do not encourage free, frank and impartial advice from the civil servants. This hinders mutual understanding and cooperation.
- (ii) The emergence of personal affiliations between the minister and the civil servant leading to politicisation of the civil service.
- (iii) Frequent use of transfer, suspension and disciplinary powers by ministers against civil servants who do not act favourably.
- (iv) Factionalism, group rivalry and casteism among the ministers and the civil servants.

- (v) The end of "one dominant party system" (i.e. the Congress) leading to political instability. It does not facilitate the growth of mutual confidence.
- (vi) Lack of proper understanding with regard to their respective roles. The ministers usually interfere with day-to-day administration while the civil servants do not bring important matters to the notice of ministers.
- (vii) The attitude of ministers to blame the civil servants for their failures. According to Chagla Commission, "The doctrine of ministerial responsibility has two facets. The minister has complete autonomy within his sphere of authority. As a necessary corollary, he must take full responsibility for the actions of his servants."
- (viii) The habit of civil servants to criticise the ministers and their policies in social and private circles make the ministers react similarly.
  - (ix) The civil servants are not sensitive towards the difficulties and problems of the ministers. They do not appreciate the political role of ministers who try to accommodate individual and group interests.
  - (x) The ministers and the civil servants differ from each other in terms of historical role, social background, professional commitments, mental ability and outlook and so on.
