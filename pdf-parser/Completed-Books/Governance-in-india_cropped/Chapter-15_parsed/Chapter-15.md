# **CENTRAL ADVISORY BOARD OF EDUCATION**

The Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE), the highest advisory body to advise the Central and state governments in the field of education, was first established in 1920 and dissolved in 1923 as a measure of economy. It was revived in 1935 and continued to exist till 1994.

Despite the fact that in the past, important decisions had been taken on the advice of CABE and it had provided a forum for widespread consultation and examination of issues relating to educational and cultural development, it was unfortunately not reconstituted after the expiry of its extended tenure in 1994.

The National Policy on Education, 1986 (as modified in 1992) envisages that the CABE will play a pivotal role in reviewing educational development, determining the changes required to improve the system and monitoring implementation, and will function through appropriate mechanisms created to ensure contact with, and coordination among, the various areas of human resource development. Accordingly, the CABE has since been reconstituted by the Government in 2004.

The CABE consists of nominated members representing various interests in addition to elected members from the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and the representatives of the Government of India, state governments and UT Administrations.

# **COUNCIL FOR ADVANCEMENT OF PEOPLE'S ACTION AND RURAL TECHNOLOGY**

# **NATIONAL COMMISSION ON POPULATION**

The National Commission on Population was constituted in May 2000 to review, monitor and give direction for the implementation of the National Population Policy (NPP), 2000 with a view to meeting the goals set out in the Policy, to promote inter-sectoral coordination, involve the civil society in planning and implementation, facilitate initiatives to improve performance in the demographically weaker states in the country and to explore the possibilities of international cooperation in support of the goals set out in the policy.

In the first meeting of the Commission, the then Prime Minister had announced the formation of an Empowered Action Group within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for paying focused attention to states with deficient national socio-demographic indices and establishment of National Population Stabilisation Fund to provide a window for canalising monies from national voluntary sources to specific aid projects designed to contribute to population stabilisation.

The Commission was reconstituted in April, 2005 with 40 members under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister. The Minister of Health and Family Welfare and the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission are Vice Chairmen of the Commission. The present membership also includes the Chief Ministers of the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

# **STAFF INSPECTION UNIT**

The Staff Inspection Unit (SIU) was set up in the year 1964 with the objective of securing economy in the staffing of government organisations consistent with administrative efficiency and evolving performance standards and work norms. The SIU operates under the Department of Expenditure in the Ministry of Finance.

Scientific and technical organisations are not within the purview of the SIU but a committee constituted by the Head of the respective department, with a representative from SIU as a core Member, conducts study of such organisations.

In the changed scenario, and keeping in view the Government emphasis on better governance and improved delivery of services, the role of SIU has been re-defined. The SIU has been positioned to act as catalyst in assisting the line ministries and autonomous organisations in improving their organisational effectiveness.

As per the expanded mandate, in addition to its existing role, SIU would now also undertake organisational analysis primarily to cover the areas of organisational systems, financial management systems, delivery systems, client-customer satisfaction, employees'concerns etc., and suggest appropriate organisational structure, re-engineering of processes, measures to ensure optimum utilisation of resources and overcome delays besides exploring the possibilities of outsourcing some of the activities with a view to achieve enhanced output/effectiveness with only the minimum essential expenditure.

# **OFFICE OF THE CHIEF ADVISER COST**

The Office of the Chief Adviser Cost (CAC) is one of the divisions functioning in the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance. The office is responsible for advising the ministries and government undertakings on cost accounts matters and to undertake cost investigation work on their behalf. It is a professional agency staffed by cost/chartered accountants.

The office was set up as an independent agency of the Central Government to verify the cost of production and to determine the fair selling price for Government departments including defence purchases in respect of the cases referred to. The role of the office was further enlarged and extended to fixing prices for a number of products covered under the Essential Commodities Act, such as, petroleum, steel, coal, cement, etc. under the Administered Price Mechanism (APM).

The office is also the cadre controlling office for the Indian Cost Accounts Service (ICoAS) and looks after training requirements of the officers for continuous up-gradation of their knowledge and skills.

#### **OFFICE OF THE PRINCIPAL SCIENTIFIC ADVISER**

The Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India (PSA to GOI) is primarily responsible for:

- 1. Evolving policies, strategies and missions for generation of innovations and support systems for multiple applications
- 2. Generating science and technology tasks in strategic, economic and social sectors in partnership with Government departments, institutions and industry.

The tasks of the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India (PSA's Office), therefore, involve creation of missions and also undertaking of multi-departmental, multiinstitutional projects in strategic, technological and other areas of economic/social relevance.

The PSA's Office tries to establish synergy among Government departments, academic institutions and industry. This synergy is required because, though the scientific business of the Government is divided amongst various departments, there are some areas which fall into nobody's domain and there are certain areas which fall into domains of many Ministries/Departments.

The PSA to GOI is also Chairman, ex-officio, of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet (SAC-C) and thus the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India (PSA's Office) also serves as the Secretariat to the SAC-C.
