4. **Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF):** Initially raised as the Crown Representative Police in 1939 at Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh, the Force was rechristened Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) after Independence. Since then, the Force has achieved remarkable growth in strength and capabilities. It has become the largest Central Para-Military Force (CPMF).

The CRPF is at present handling a wide range of duties covering law and order and counter insurgency, anti-militancy and anti-terrorism operations. It plays a key role in assisting the states in maintaining public order and countering subversive activities of militant groups. It plays an important role in the peaceful conduct of election in states/at the Centre.

The CRPF personnel are on continuous vigil in various sensitive areas. They are also performing guarding duties of the vital installations and buildings of religious importance. Further, they play an important role in the arrangements for the annual Amarnath Yatra in Jammu and Kashmir.

**Rapid Action Force (RAF):** In 1992, some battalions of CRPF were reorganised and converted into RAF. The personnel in RAF are trained and equipped to be an effective strike force in communal riots or similar situations. These battalions are located at communally sensitive locations across the country to facilitate quick response in case of such incidents.

**Commando Battalions for Resolute Action (CoBRA):** In 2008, the Government approved the raising of a specialised force named CoBRA in the CRPF. The CoBRA battalions are trained and equipped for commando and guerilla / jungle warfare type of short and intelligence based quick operations, and are located in areas affected by Left Wing extremism.

- (b) To identify the organised gangs of smugglers and areas vulnerable to smuggling, collection of intelligence against them and their immobilisation
- (c) To maintain liaison with the intelligence and enforcement agencies in India and abroad for collection of intelligence and in-depth investigation of important cases having Inter-Commissionerate and international ramification, and
- (d) To alert field formations for interception of suspects and contraband goods, assessment of current and likely trends in smuggling.

# **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)**

The FIU has been set up in 2004 to coordinate and strengthen the collection and sharing of financial intelligence through effective national, regional and global network to combat money laundering and related crimes.

The FIU is the central national agency responsible for receiving, processing, analysing and disseminating information relating to suspect financial transactions. It receives prescribed information from various entities in the financial sector under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 (PMLA) and in appropriate cases, disseminates information to relevant intelligence/enforcement agencies.

### **National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO)**

The NTRO is entrusted with the task of planning, designing, establishing and operating important technical facilities in the country. It is also responsible for monitoring and conducting defensive and offensive cyber operations.

The NTRO was created in 2002. It is placed under the direct control of the National Security Advisor (NSA).

# **CENTRAL INVESTIGATION AGENCIES**

**1. National Investigation Agency (NIA):** The NIA has been created in pursuance of the enactment of the NIA Act, 2008. It is mandated, at the national level, to investigate and prosecute offences affecting the sovereignty, security and integrity of India, friendly relations with foreign States and offences under Acts enacted to implement international treaties, agreements, conventions and resolutions of the United Nations and other international organisations.

Therefore, the NIA was created by Parliament to enable the detection, prevention, investigation and prosecution of terrorism-related incidents in India on a national scale. It is the only exclusive counter-terrorism agency in India. It is a law enforcement agency dedicated towards countering terrorists anywhere in India at anytime. It is not merely a post-incident investigating agency, but also a pre-incident disruption agency.

A workshop on NIA was organised by the Ministry of Home Affairs in 2009 to explain the legal framework to fight terrorism in the country. It was also suggested that NIA should hold regional quarterly meetings with State Police and Union Territory Police forces to discuss the status of cases under investigation and prosecution, fugitives, and other issues relating to mutual cooperation and assistance in criminal investigation etc. Pursuant to this decision, the states have nominated Nodal officers, and quarterly coordination meetings are held Zone-wise to discuss the above issues.

**2. Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI):** The CBI was established by a resolution in 1963. At present, it comprises the following divisions:

- (i) Anti-Corruption Division
- (ii) Economic Offences Division
- (iii) Special Crimes Division
- (iv) Policy and International Police Cooperation Division
- (v) Administration Division
- (vi) Directorate of Prosecution
- (vii) Central Forensic Science Laboratory

The CBI is a multidisciplinary investigation agency of the Government of India and undertakes investigation of corruption related cases, economic offences and cases of conventional crime.

The CBI normally confines its activities in the anti-corruption field to offences committed by the employees of Central Government and Union Territories and their public sector undertakings.

The CBI takes up investigation of conventional crimes like murder, kidnapping, rape etc., on reference from the state governments or when directed by the Supreme Court/High Courts.

The CBI acts as the "National Central Bureau" of Interpol in India. The Interpol Wing of the CBI coordinates requests for investigation-related activities originating from Indian law enforcement agencies and the member countries of the Interpol.

**3. Directorate of Enforcement:** The Directorate of Enforcement came into existence in 1960. It is implementing two statutes, viz, Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA), and Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). It is also processing and recommending cases for Preventive Detention of offenders under Conservation of Foreign Exchange & Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1975 (COFEPOSA). Further, it is handling the residuary work related to FERA, 1973, i.e., cases under adjudication, trial as also the pending penalties-related tasks.

The Directorate is mandated to enforce the provisions of FEMA. The cases of suspected contravention of the provisions of FEMA are detected and investigated, followed by adjudication proceedings, which are quasi-judicial in nature, and which entail imposition of penalties on the offenders, besides ordering confiscation of the funds involved therein.

The Directorate is responsible for (a) investigation of cases for the offence of money laundering (b) seizure or attachment of property involved in the offence of money laundering and (c) prosecuting the persons accused of the offence of money laundering.

**4. Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN):** India is a signatory to Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, and United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances of 1988.

In India, control over Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and precursor chemicals is exercised through the provision of Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.

The CBN undertakes action to prevent the illicit trafficking of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. It also undertakes investigation and prosecution of drug related offences, and tracing and freezing of illegally acquired property of drug traffickers for forfeiture and confiscation.

### **STATE POLICE ADMINISTRATION**

Under the Constitution of India, 'public order' and 'police' are state subjects. Therefore, the state governments are primarily responsible for the maintenance of public order and prevention and detection of crimes within their jurisdictions. For this purpose, the states have their own police organisations.

The structure and functioning of the state police forces are governed by the Indian Police Act of 1861. Later, some states have also enacted their own State Police Acts, mostly on the lines of the 1861 Act. Further, the Indian Penal Code (1862), the Indian Evidence Act (1872) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (1973) also govern the functioning of the state police forces.

The Home Department of a state government is responsible for law and order and policy matters regarding police administration in the state. It is headed politically by the Home Minister, and administratively by the Home Secretary. It exercises administrative control over the state police organisation (i.e., executive organisation) called as the State Police Department.

#### **Organisation of State Police**

The Director-General of Police (DGP) is the executive/administrative head of the State Police Department. He advises the state government on all police matters, both administrative and operational. He is responsible to the state government for the administration of the police force throughout the state.

For the purpose of police administration, a state is divided into a number of police ranges. A police range consists of a group of districts. Thus, a police range is below the state level but above the district level. Each police range is headed by a Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG).

Some states have also created police zones, each comprising two or more police ranges. In other words, a police zone is an intermediary between the state and police ranges. Each police zone is headed by an Inspector General of Police (IGP).

A district is the most important unit of police administration in the state. A district police force is placed under the charge of a Superintendent of Police (SP). According to the Indian Police Act of 1861, the administration of police in a district is vested in the SP, but subject to the general control and direction of the District Magistrate (i.e., District Collector). Thus, there is a system of dual control of law and order in the district, that is, control by the district magistrate and control by the departmental line headed by the DGP.

A district is divided into a number of police sub-divisions. Each police sub-division is placed under the charge of an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP).

A police sub-division is further divided into a number of police stations. Each police station is placed under the charge of a Sub-Inspector of Police (SI).

Some states have also created police circles, each comprising three to six police stations. Each police circle is headed by a Circle Inspector of Police (CI).

The police station is the lowest tier in the state police organisation and also the basic and primary unit of police administration in the state. The Assistant Sub Inspectors of Police (ASIs), Police Head Constable (HC) and Police Constables (PCs) assist the SI who is also called the Station House Officer (SHO).

The entire organisational set-up of the state police is shown below.

## **CITY POLICE ADMINISTRATION**

### **Commissionerate System**

In the metropolitan and other big cities, the commissionerate system of policing has been adopted. Under this system, the Commissioner of Police is made responsible for the city police administration and the entire police force is placed under his charge.
Unlike the district SP who acts under the general control and direction of the district magistrate (i.e., district collector), the Commissioner of Police acts independently of the district magistrate. He is endowed with all the magisterial powers which are usually exercised by the district magistrate in a district. This means that the district magistrate has no role in the city police administration.

In his task, the Commissioner of Police is assisted by a number of Additional Commissioners of Police, Joint Commissioners of Police, Deputy Commissioners of Police, Assistant Commissioners of Police, Inspectors of Police, Sub-Inspectors of Police and other lower rank police officials.

Initially, the commissionerate system of policing prevailed only in four cities. After Independence, this system has been extended to a number of other cities. The present position is indicated below in [Table](#page-16-0) 9.3.

# **ROLE OF HOME GUARDS**

**Emergence** Home Guards is a voluntary force, first raised in India in 1946, to assist the police in controlling civil disturbance and communal riots. Subsequently, the concept of the voluntary citizens' force was adopted by several states. In the wake of Chinese aggression in 1962, the Centre advised the states and union territories to merge their existing voluntary organisation into one uniform voluntary force known as Home Guards.

**Functions** The functions of Home Guards are as follows:

- 1. To serve as an auxiliary to the police in the maintenance of law and order and internal security situations
- 2. To help the community in any kind of emergency such as an air-raid, fire, cyclone, earthquake, epidemic, etc.
- 3. To help in maintenance of essential services
- 4. To promote communal harmony and assist the administration in protecting weaker sections
- 5. To participate in socio-economic and welfare activities
- 6. To perform civil defence duties

**Organisation** Home Guards are of two types—rural and urban. In the border states, Border Wing Home Guards Battalions have also been raised, which serve as an auxiliary to the Border Security Force. The total strength of Home Guards in the country is 5,73,793 against which the raised strength is of 5,04,621 Home Guards. The organisation is spread over in all states and union territories except in Kerala.

**Recruitment** Home Guards are raised under the Home Guards Act and Rules of the states/union territories. They are recruited from various cross sections of the people such as doctors, engineers, lawyers, private sector organisations, college and university students, agricultural and industrial workers, etc., who give their spare time to the organisation for betterment of the community. All citizens of India, who are in the age group of 18–50, are eligible to become members of Home Guards. Normal tenure of membership in Home Guards is three to five years.

**Facilities** The amenities and facilities given to Home Guards include free uniform, duty allowances and awards for gallantry, distinguished and meritorious services. A Home Guard, whenever called out for duty/training, is paid duty/training allowance at prescribed rates to meet out-of-pocket expenses.

**Training** The members of Home Guards with three years service in the organisation are trained by the police in maintenance of law and order, prevention of crime, anti-dacoity measures, border patrolling, prohibition, flood relief, fire-fighting, election duties and social welfare activities. In the event of national emergency, some portion of civil defence work is also entrusted to the Home Guards.

**Centre-State Coordination** The Ministry of Home Affairs formulates the policy in respect of role, raising, training, equipping, establishment and other important matters of Home Guards Organisation. The expenditure on Home Guards is generally shared between Central and state governments in the ratio of 25% by the Centre and 75% by the state governments for raising, training and equipping on reimbursement basis. For North-Eastern states, the sharing pattern between the Centre and states is in the ratio of 50:50.

# **CIVIL DEFENCE ORGANISATION**

**Meaning** Civil defence includes any measures not amounting to actual combat, for affording

protection to any person, property, place or thing in India against any hostile attack whether from air, land, sea or other places or for depriving/mitigating the effect of any such attack: whether such measures are taken before, during or after the time of such attack. It is to be organised as an integral part of the defence of the country.

**Functions** During times of war and emergencies, the Civil Defence Organisation has the vital role of guarding the hinterland, supporting the armed forces, mobilising the citizens and helping civil administration for

- 1. saving life and property
- 2. minimizing damage
- 3. maintaining continuity in production centers and
- 4. raising public morale.

The concept of civil defence over the years has shifted from management of damage against conventional weapons to also include threat perceptions against nuclear weapons, biological and chemical warfare and natural disasters.

**Policy** The Civil Defence Act, 1968 is applicable throughout the country, but the Civil Defence Organisation is raised only in such areas and zones which are considered vulnerable to enemy attacks. The revision and renewal of categorised civil defence towns is being done at regular intervals, with the level of perceived threat with regards to external aggression or hostile attacks by anti-national elements or terrorists to vital installations, being the fundamental criterion for categorisation. At present, civil defence activities are restricted to 225 categorised towns, spread over the states/union territories.

**Organisation** Civil Defence is primarily organised on a voluntary basis except for a small nucleus of permanent staff and establishment, which is augmented during emergencies. The present target of civil defence volunteers is 13.20 lakh, out of which 5.51 lakh volunteers have already been raised and 4.61 lakh have been trained. These volunteers are supervised and trained by Deputy Controllers, Medical Officers and Civil Defence Instructors, who hold permanent posts.

**Training** Apart from carrying out training and rehearsal/demonstration of civil defence measures during peace time, civil defence volunteers are also deployed, on a voluntary basis, in various constructive and nation building activities, which include providing assistance to the administration in undertaking social and welfare services and in the prevention/mitigation of natural/man-made disasters as well as in post-disaster response and relief operations. The civil defence training is conducted by the state governments/UT administrations in three tiers, i.e. at the local/town level, state level and national level.

**Role in Law and Order** The scheme for revamping the civil defence set-up in the country, which has been launched in 2009, focuses on the training of civil defence volunteers in the following areas :

- 1. Intelligence gathering, maintenance of communal harmony, prevention of rumour mongering, reporting of suspicious activities and maintaining general vigil in the area of their operation
- 2. Assisting police in law and order situations, etc.
- 3. Rescue and relief operation during manmade disasters
- 4. Evacuation of casualties and providing first-aid
