## **NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR WOMEN**

#### **Establishment of the Commission**

The Committee on Status of Women in India (set-up by the Government of India) in 1974 recommended the constitution of a National Commission for Women to fulfill the surveillance functions and to facilitate redressal of grievances and to accelerate the socio-economic development of women. Again, the successive women-related committees, commissions and plans including the National Perspective Plan for Women (1988) have also recommended the constitution of such an apex body for women. Accordingly, the National Commission for Women was constituted in 1992 for protecting, promoting and safeguarding the interests and rights of women.

The Commission is an autonomous statutory (and not a constitutional) body. It was established under a legislation enacted by the Parliament, namely, the National Commission for Women Act, 1990. The Ministry of Women and Child Development of the Government of India is the nodal ministry for the Commission.

The Commission has a wide mandate covering almost all aspects of women's development and empowerment. Its specific objectives are:

- (i) To review the constitutional and legal safeguards for women
- (ii) To recommend remedial legislative measures
- (iii) To facilitate redressal of grievances
- (iv) To advise the government on all policy matters affecting women

#### **Composition of the Commission**

The Commission is a multi-member body consisting of a chairperson, five members and a membersecretary. The chairperson should be someone who is committed to the cause of women. The five members should be from amongst persons of ability, integrity and standing who have had experience in law or legislation, trade unionism, management of an industry or organisation committed to increasing the employment potential of women, women's voluntary organisations (including women activists), administration, economic development, health, education or social welfare. However, at least one member each should belong to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes respectively.

The member-secretary should be (i) an expert in the field of management, organisational structure or sociological movement, or (ii) an officer who is a member of a Civil Service of the Union or an all-India service or holds a civil post under the Union.

The chairperson, members and member-secretary are all nominated by the Central Government (Ministry of Women and Child Development). Their salaries, allowances and other service conditions are also prescribed by the Central Government.

# **NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR MINORITIES**

#### **Establishment of the Commission**

In 1978, the Government of India *vide* an executive resolution, set up a Minorities Commission to safeguard the interests of the minorities. The resolution explained the reasons for the establishment of the Minorities Commission in the following way:

"Despite the safeguards provided in the Constitution and the laws in force, there persists among the Minorities a feeling of inequality and discrimination. In order to preserve secular traditions and to promote National Integration, the Government of India attaches the highest importance to the enforcement of the safeguards provided for the Minorities and is of firm view that effective institutional arrangements are urgently required for the enforcement and implementation of all the safeguards provided for the Minorities in the Constitution, in the Central and State Laws and in the Government policies and administrative schemes enunciated from time to time."

Later, it was felt that the Minorities Commission be given statutory status so that it may infuse confidence among the minorities about the working and the effectiveness of the Commission. It would then also carry more weight with the State Governments/Union Territory Administrations and the Ministries / Departments and the other organisations of the Central Government.

With the enactment of the National Commission for Minorities Act (1992), the Minorities Commission became a statutory body and was renamed the National Commission for Minorities. The first statutory Commission was constituted in 1993.

The Act does not define the term "minority", but enables the Central Government to notify "minorities" for the purposes of the Act. Accordingly, the Centre in 1993 notified five religious communities viz., Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Zoroastrians (Parsis) as minority communities. In January 2014, the Jain community was added to this list

### **Composition of the Commission**
