#### POPULATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT

This chapter seeks to explore the population growth in India and its consequences for environment from the late eighteenth to the early twenty-first centuries, comprising of precolonial, colonial and post-Independence period (1750–2017). This chapter is divided into five sections. The first section deals with the demographic features during the precolonial period or until the colonial period (up to 1750s). The second section analyses the trend of population growth during the colonial period, i.e., from the late eighteenth century till the mid-twentieth century (1750–1947). The third section analyses the trends of population growth during the post-Independence period, i.e., from the mid-twentieth century to the early twenty-first century (1947–2017). The fourth section deals with the population and environmental consequences from the late eighteenth century to the early twenty-first century (1750–2017) and the last section ends with concluding observations.

#### *POPULATION DURING THE PRECOLONIAL PERIOD*

Until the colonial period, the statistics on population were not available. However, various accounts suggest that the population density was very low. Till the mid-seventeenth century, the population of the Indian subcontinent was about 100 million and it has increased to 130–160 million in the mideighteenth century.<sup>1</sup> Frequent wars among the rulers and famines have led to lower levels of population growth. According to the Census Report 1871, 'Centuries of lawlessness and internal strife had undoubtedly thinned the people, and large areas, which are not thick with a settled and industrious population, were then absolutely waste and untenanted.'2 Adding to that, frequent famine also resulted in the low population growth; for instance, severe famines affected the people of the Presidency in years 1733, 1782 to 1783, 1805 to 1807, 1824 and 1832-1838.<sup>3</sup>

The Indian subcontinent was ruled by several minor dynasties and constant warfare was seen among them. Every household has to provide manpower for the warfare which was mandatory. This is evident from the ancient period. For example, frequent wars among the Chera, Chola and Pandya kings during the ancient period. In addition to the internal

warfare, external forces also caused wars from the early medieval period. The Afghans and Muslims invasions of the Indian subcontinent occurred in the medieval period. From the late eighteenth century, European ruler extended their rule in different parts of the country. Apart from war, natural calamities like droughts, famines, cholera and other epidemics also caused loss of population. Consequently, the population density was very low and their longevity was also very short.

#### *POPULATION DURING THE COLONIAL PERIOD (1750–1947)*

Since the seventeenth century to the mid-nineteenth century (1600–1850), various estimates of the size of the population in the Indian subcontinent showed that the population has gradually increased. It further indicates that in the first half of the seventeenth century, either the population had declined or was stagnant. Since the second half of the seventeenth century, various estimates suggest that the population has invariably increased till the mid-nineteenth century. Of course, the growth rate is varied among the different estimates.<sup>4</sup> In other words, the population has increased in the Indian subcontinent from 100 million in 1600–1650 to 130–160 million in 1750, and from 140–200 million in 1800 to 190–240 million in the 1850s  $5$ During the early colonial period, population data was not available. The population density too was very low at the end of the eighteenth century; for example, the Salem and Baramahal regions were brought under the colonial administration by the end of the eighteenth century. At that time in history, the total population was about 600,000.<sup>6</sup>

Though the estimation was crude, it will give us some idea about the size of population in the Indian subcontinent. One of the earliest available accounts on population were that for the Madras Presidency. According to 1822 Census, the total population of the Madras Presidency was about 13,470,923.<sup>7</sup> Subsequently, in 1836–1838, another enumeration was held and the total population figures returned was about 13,967,395. In 1823–1824, the Deccan districts—Vizagapatanam, Guntur, Nellore, North Arcot, South Arcot, Madras and Salem—were affected by famine.<sup>8</sup> Over the fifteen years, the population has increased only by about 490,472. In 1833–1834, cholera and famine have affected both Guntur and Nellore districts which have, lost more than one-half of their population.<sup>9</sup> This declining trend was reflected in the subsequent census. According to 1822 Census, the total population of Guntur and Nellore districts was about 894,221 and it has declined to 596,152 in 1836–1838. In other words, about 298,063 persons, which forms about 33.33 per cent, were lost due to famines and other epidemics. This famine also affected the Cuddappa, Bellary and North Arcot districts

(Table 3.1). In the Rajahmundry, Guntoor, Nellore, Cuddapah, Chingleput, North Arcot, Madura, and Salem districts, the returns show an actual decrease of population. Scholars argue that this decline was due to the possibility of not including certain estates in the 1836– 1838 Census. But the fact of the matter is that after 1822 Census, in 1823–1824, prior to 1836–1838 Census, famines have affected in these districts. Consequently, it had a huge impact on the population not because of the possibility of exclusion of the estates alone.

# **Trends of Population Growth in Madras Presidency, from 1851–1852 to 1871**

For the Indian subcontinent, population data was available from 1870 onwards. However, census was carried out in different provinces at different point of time. For example, census was undertaken in the North-Western Provinces in 1853 and 1865, Oude in 1869, Punjab in 1855 and 1868, Hyderabad Assigned Districts in 1867 and in the Central Provinces in 1866. In the Madras Presidency, quinquennial census was carried out from 1851 to 1852 onwards. According to the Memorandum on the Census of British India (1875), 'in Madras quinquennial returns have been prepared since 1851–52 by the officers of the Revenue Department, giving with more or less accuracy the numbers of the people in each district.'11 This data is useful to understand the problem of population growth since the mid-nineteenth century. In 1851–1852, the total population of Madras Presidency was about 215.82 lakhs and it has increased to 236.04 lakhs in 1861–1862. The population growth rate for the decade (from 1851–1852 to 1861–1862) was about 9.38 per cent. The population further increased to 308.83 lakhs in 1871 and the growth rate was about 30.83 per cent (Table 3.2). In other words, the population growth rate was about 33.10 per cent within two decades between 1851–1852 and 1871.

Though the population has increased about one-third within two decades, the population growth rate was not same among the different districts of the Madras Presidency. Invariably, the population growth was high but there was variation among the districts. The population has declined in Bellary between 1851–1851 and 1856–1857 due to famines in 1853–1854. Between 1861–1861 and 1866–1867, the population has increased only marginally in Ganjam, Bellary, North Arcot and Madurai due to a famine in 1865–1866.

#### **Population in India, 1871–1941**

Since the last quarter of the nineteenth century, a complete enumeration of census was carried out. According to the 1871 Census, the total population of the Indian subcontinent was about 23.88 crores and it has increased to 31.87 crores in 1941 (Table 3.3). From the last quarter of the nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century, over the seven decades, the population growth was about 33.43 per cent. Though the population growth has increased one-third of the population over seven decades, the actual increase took place during the last two decades of the colonial era, i.e., 1920s onwards. In other words, the population more or less remained constant from 1880s

to till 1920s. Whereas, between 1871 and 1921, i.e., a period of five decades, the population growth was only 5.23 per cent. In fact, during this period, for two decades, the population growth was negative. A large number of deaths took place due to insufficient living space and household amenities during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Nearly for about four decades (1880–1920), there was no change in the population due to severe famine, drought and war in different parts of the country. Since the 1920s, the population has increased from 25.13 crores in 1921 to 36.11 crores in 1941, which meant the growth rate was about 26.79 per cent.

During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, a series of famines affected different parts of the country. The series of famines were—the Orissa famine in 1866, the Bihar famine in 1873–1874, the Madras famine in 1876–1878 that severely affected the Deccan districts Nellore, Chengalput, Salem, and Coimbatore, the 1883–1884 famine that affected Bellary and Ananthapur districts, the Ganjam famine in 1888–1889, the 1896–1897 famine that affected the Deccan districts Ganjam, Vizagapatanam, and Godavari, the 1899–1900 famine that affected the Deccan districts Kistna and Nellore, and the 1901 famines that affected Cuddappa, Ananthapur, Chengalput and North Arcot districts.13 Famines occurred frequently in northern and north-western parts of the Madras Presidency.

# **Cholera and Plague**

Since the last quarter of the nineteenth century, a large number of deaths occurred due to cholera and plague and this trend has continued till the third quarter of the twentieth century. Over the fifty years period from 1877 to 1931, approximately 3–4 lakh people lost their lives annually. However, after the third decade of the twentieth century, this

death rate was contained to less than 1.5 lakhs (Table 3.4). Likewise, in four decades, between 1898 and 1938, 124 lakh people lost their lives due to plague. In other words, more than 3 lakh people lost their lives every year from 1891 to 1938. During the first three decades of the twentieth century, a large number of people lost their lives due to plague. From 1898 to 1918, more than 102.54 lakh people lost their lives (Table 3.5). After the third decade of the twentieth century, these deaths were either contained or declined due to the development of modern health facilities. Till the first three decades of the twentieth century, the mortality rate was high and after that it has declined remarkably. The declining trend was due to the 'Western Power-science culture'14. According to Mandelbaum (1949):

The application of medical science in India has greatly reduced the toll taken by smallpox, cholera, and other diseases. Famine was controlled, indeed eliminated, for several decades through the building of a network of railroads which moved food supplies promptly into deficit areas.15

 In other words, in the five decades from 1871 to 1921, the population growth was only 5.3 per cent. From the last quarter of the nineteenth century till the first quarter of the twentieth century, population has increased marginally from 23.88 crores to 25.13 crores due to famines and droughts and a large number of people had also lost their lives due to cholera and plague.

# *Mortality Rate*

Mortality rate is one of the important indicators for population growth. It is expected that the improved health infrastructural facilities will reduce the mortality rate. However, till 1871, there are no series of data available for the entire country. Since the last quarter of the nineteenth century, mortality data became available. For the five decades from 1871–1881 to 1911–1921, the mortality rate has continued to increase from 40 to 47. However, the mortality rate has gradually declined from 1921 to 1931 onwards till the end of the colonial rule (Table 3.6). This decline was due to expansion of the medical facilities as well as famines and preventive measures taken during the last two and a half decades of the British era.

# *Birth Rate*

The birth rate has not increased from the late eighteenth century to the early twentieth century. Since 1871–1881, the birth rate was about 49 and it has declined to 46 in 1891–1901. In the subsequent decade (1901–1911), the birth rate has increased to 49. However, the birth rate has declined marginally in the subsequent decades of the colonial period (Table 3.6). It is expected that if the health infrastructural facilities improved during the last phase of the colonial period, the birth rate was supposed to increase whereas it has actually declined. It means that the death rate has declined during the last phase of the colonial period, may be due to famine or drought control measures and not due to the improvement in the health infrastructural facilities.

# *Life Expectancy at Birth*

On the one hand, the mortality rate has increased and, on the other, the birth rate has declined from 1871–1881 to 1911–1921, consequently the average life expectancy at birth has declined from 25 to 20 for the same period (Table 3.6). The life expectancy at birth has constantly declined from the last quarter of the nineteenth century to the first quarter of the twentieth century due to frequent famines, droughts and a large number of the deaths occurred due to cholera and plague during this period (see Tables 3.5 and 3.6). However, since 1921–1931 onwards, life expectancy has improved marginally from 26 to 32 in the subsequent decades.

# *Infant Mortality Rate*

In addition to the high mortality rate, decline of birth rate and low level of life expectancy, the infant mortality rate has increased remarkably during the same period. In 1871–1881, the infant mortality rate was 263 and it has increased to 290 in 1911–1921 (Table 3.6). An increasing trend of infant mortality from 1871–1881 to 1911–1921 clearly indicates that the health infrastructural facilities were either poor or lacking during the colonial period. However, in the subsequent decades, the infant mortality rate has declined to 211 in the next two decades.

# *Health Infrastructure*

The first initiative was undertaken by the colonial administration to improve health infrastructural facilities during the second half of the nineteenth century. In 1859, the Royal Commission was appointed to enquire about the health of the army personnel in India. It has suggested providing health facilities not only to army but also to civilians. Accordingly, the Commission of Public Health Offices were established in Madras, Bombay and Calcutta in 1864.19

# **Report of the Health Survey and Development Committee (1946)**

The Report of the Health Survey and Development Committee (1946), popularly known as Bhore Committee, was appointed by the
Government of India in October 1943 to make '(a) a broad survey of the present position in regard to health conditions and health organisation in British India, and (b) recommendations for future developments.'20

The health infrastructural facilities were very poor during the British period. In 1942–1943, there were 47,400 doctors, 7,000 nurses, 750 health visitors, 7,000 midwives (qualified), 75 pharmacists (qualified) and 1,000 dentists. The total population was about 30 million. One doctor per 6,300 people; one nurse per 43,000 people; one health visitor per 400,000 people; one midwife (qualified) per 60,000; one pharmacist (qualified) per  $400,000$  people; and for  $300,000$  people, one dentist.<sup>21</sup> Again, the number of medical institutions was high in the urban areas as compared to that of the rural areas.<sup>22</sup> The available beds per 1,000 people were only 0.14 bed in British India.23

Precisely, from the last quarter of the nineteenth century to the first quarter of the twentieth century, the mortality rate has increased, whereas birth rate has declined marginally. Infant mortality rate has also increased and consequently life expectancy has declined. In other words, human life was under great threat during this period. Various scholars have concluded that the famines were controlled due to the railway network and diseases were controlled due to the improved modern health facilities.<sup>24</sup> It is true that the railway network rose from 5,005 miles in 1871 to 37,000 miles in 1921, and the kind of modern health infrastructural facilities that have been developed during this time have yet to be analysed. The fundamental question is why these 37,000 miles of railway network and other health infrastructural facilities did not make any impact on controlling diseases and demographic features of the country? If their claims are valid, then why did the Bengal Famine occur in the 1940s? Further the evidences suggest that despite the great depression and the Second World War, except in the case of birth rate, other demographic profiles have shown a positive improvement. This may be due to the fact that Nationalist Movement gained great momentum since the 1930s, and the British administration has made some efforts to provide the facilities for the benefit of the people. The Nationalist Movement compelled the Britishers to change their strategy from extraction and exploitation to securing the well-being of the people in the Indian subcontinent, while for their survival may be a valid proposition.

#### *Number of Houses*

In 1871, the number of inhabited houses in British India was about 370 lakh houses; an average of forty-one houses per square miles and 5.14 persons per house. The number of inhabited per square miles has varied for different regions, in the range of 6 to 102 (Table 3.7).

**Table 3.7:** Number of Inhabited Houses per Square Mile in British India, 1871

*Source*: Henry Waterfield, *Memorandum on the Census of British India 1871–72.*<sup>25</sup>

Population has increased from 23.88 crores in 1871 to 27.89 crores in 1941. In other words, the population growth was about 33 per cent over the period of seven decades (1871–1941). At the same time, the number of houses has increased from 3.70 crores in 1871 to 6.38 crores in 1941. In other words, the growth rate of number of houses has increased to 72.28 per cent for the same period (Table 3.8). The average size of the household has gradually declined from 6.45 persons in 1871 to 4.99 persons in 1941. In fact, the average size of the population has declined to less than 4 persons in the three decades from 1911 to 1931.

## *Urbanisation*

Urbanisation in India is an unplanned and uncontrolled process. During the precolonial period, cities and towns were developed around forts, ports and pilgrimage centres. In fact, the East India Company (EIC) developed a city like Madras in 1639. The city was designed in such a way that it facilitated the residential and marketing area. Of course, it was a very small area in the early seventieth century.

Until the colonial period, India's urbanisation mainly centred around the forts, ports and religiously important places. The same trend has continued during the early colonial period. Till the second half of the nineteenth century, India had only a very few towns and had no great manufacturing centres.26 In 1871, less than one-twentieth population of British India lived in the urban areas. To be precise, according to Hunter (1886):

Calcutta itself has grown out of a cluster of hamlets on the bank of the Hugli; and the term 'municipality' which in Europe is only applied to towns, often means in India a 'rural union' or collection of homesteads for the purpose of local government.<sup>27</sup>

According to the 1871 Census, about 56 lakh people or less than 3 per cent of the population lived in 44 largest towns. The largest towns were Calcutta (7.95 lakhs), Bombay (6.44 lakhs), Madras (3.98 lakhs) and Lucknow (2.85 lakhs). The first three cities were capitals of their respective Presidencies (Table 3.9). There are twelve other towns whose population was more than a lakh: Benares, a holy city; Patna, the capital of Bihar and under Muslim rule; Delhi, the royal city of old Mughal Empire; Agra, former capital of North-Western Provinces; Allahabad, present seat of Government of North-Western Provinces; Bangalore, one of the largest cantonment areas; Amritsar, the sacred city of the Sikhs; Kanpur, the frontier cantonment of the British forces; Poona, the summer capital of Bombay and the principal cantonment in Western India; Ahmedabad, once capital of Gujarat; Surat, the commercial mistress of Western India before Bombay; and Bareilly, the chief town of Rohilkhand. In other twenty-eight towns, the population was between 50,000 and 100,000. Again, these towns were at one time historically important places.

#### **Trend of Urbanisation India, 1871–1941**

Urbanisation was very low until the colonial period and even that was largely confined to the capital cities, ports and religious towns. Until 1871, less than 5 per cent of the population only lived in urban areas. In 1881, the percentage of population living in the urban areas has increased to 7.29 per cent and further it has increased to 10.84 per cent in 1901. In the subsequent three decades, the percentage of population in urban areas has not changed much and it remained more or less the same (Table 3.10). Since 1941, the proportion of population has increased marginally to 13.86 per cent. It indicates that the growth of urbanisation was very low and confined to very few places.

#### **Trend of Villages and Towns in India, 1871–1941**

In 1871, the total number of villages and towns in India was about 4.93 lakhs and it has increased to 6.99 lakhs in 1931. The growth rate of villages and towns was about 42 per cent between 1871 and 1931. The number of villages and towns has increased from 4.93 lakhs in 1871 to 7.14 lakh in 1881, and from 7.18 lakh in 1891 it further increased to 7.3 lakh in 1901. Since 1901, the number of villages has gradually declined and reached a figure of 6.96 lakh villages in 1931 (Table 3.11).

In 1871, only forty-six towns had more than 50,000 population and it has increased to 104 in 1931. Only 374 towns had population between 10,000 and 50,000, and it has increased to 901 for the same period. In 1871, 1,070 towns had population between 5,000 and 10,000, and it has increased to 2,330 in 1931. The number of towns which had population of 5,000 and above shares only 0.31 per cent of the total number of villages and towns and this had increased marginally to 0.47 per cent in 1931. From 1881 onwards, in the next four decades, the growth of the urbanisation was more or less stagnant invariably among the different categories. From 1920 onwards, gradual increase took place until the mid-twentieth century.

## *POPULATION DURING THE POST-INDEPENDENCE PERIOD*

# **Population**

India's population growth has increased remarkably during the post-Independence period. In 1951, the total population was about 36 crores and it has increased to 121 crores in 2011. In other words, the population growth has increased fourfold within the six decades of the post-Independence period. The decadal growth rate of population has increased from 13.31 per cent in 1951 to 21.64 per cent in 1961 and 24.8 per cent in 1971. Since then, the growth rate has declined gradually and fell to 17.70 per cent in 2011. The population growth was very high till 1971 and later started declining gradually (Table 3.12).

## **Trends of Urban Population in India, 1951–2011**

Until Independence, and even much later, the growth rate of urbanisation in India was very low. For instance, in 1951, about 17 per cent of the population inhabited in urban areas and this proportion has increased marginally in the subsequent decade (17.97 per cent). Since 1981, the growth of urban population was remarkable and it continued likewise till the early twenty-first century. In 1971, about one-fifth of the population inhabited the urban areas and this proportion has increased to nearly one-third in 2011. Though the proportion of the urban population has increased nearly one-fifth in 1971 to one-third in 2011, the growth rate has not increased in the same manner. The urban population growth rate in India was about 600 per cent for the six decades between 1951 and 2011. The decadal growth rate of urban population for 1951–1961 was about 26.41 per cent and it has increased to 38.23 per cent and 46.14 per cent in the subsequent two decades (1961–1971 and 1971–1981). Since the 1980s, the urban population growth rate has declined from 46.14 per cent in 1971–1981 to 31.80 per cent in 2001–2011 (Table 3.14).

# **Trend of Urban Population Growth in Different States of India, 1951–2011**

Though the urban population growth has increased from 618.75 lakhs in 1951 to 3,771.06 lakhs in 2011, this growth is, however, not equally distributed among the states and union territories and wide variation exists among the states. In other words, the population growth has increased more than sixfold in six decades. But this growth is not equally distributed among the states and a wide variation exists. According to 1951 Census, about 60 per cent of the urban population lived in four states—Madras (18.07 per cent), Bombay (18.05 per cent), Uttar Pradesh

(13.94 per cent) and Bengal (9.94 per cent). Another 27 per cent of urban population lived in the six states—Hyderabad (5.62 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (4.65 per cent), Bihar (4.37 per cent), Rajasthan (3.88 per cent), Punjab (3.88 per cent) and Mysore (3.52 per cent). In other words, about 86.32 per cent of the urban population alone lived in these ten states. Another 10.39 per cent of the urban population lived in the following five states—Travancore (2.41 per cent), Madhya Bharat (2.33 per cent), Delhi (2.32 per cent), Saurashtra (2.25 per cent), and Patiala and East Punjab States Union (1.08 per cent). In short, about 97 per cent of the urban population inhabited only in 15 states (Table 3.15).

After the reorganisation of the states in 1956, the trend of urbanisation changed when compared with the 1951 Census. In 1961, nearly 50 per cent of the urban population lived in the four states—Maharashtra (14.14 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (12.01 per cent), Tamil Nadu (11.39 per cent) and West Bengal (10.82 per cent). Nearly 42 per cent of the urban population lived another seven states—Andhra Pradesh (7.95 per cent), Gujarat (6.74 per cent), Mysore (6.67 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (5.86 per cent), Punjab (5.18 per cent), Bihar (4.94 per cent) and Rajasthan (4.16 per cent). About 90 per cent of the urban population lived in eleven states. More or less the same trend has continued in the subsequent decades with a slight change.

In 2011, about one-third of the urban population was living in the four states—Maharashtra (13.48 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (11.80 per cent), Tamil Nadu (9.26 per cent) and West Bengal (7.71 per cent). About 47 per cent of the urban population was living in another seven states— Andhra Pradesh (7.48 per cent), Gujarat (6.83 per cent), Mysore (6.27 per cent), Rajasthan (4.52 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (5.32 per cent), Delhi (4.34 per cent), Kerala (4.23 per cent) and Bihar (3.12 per cent). Precisely, in twelve states about four-fifth of population were living in urban areas. In most of the Northeastern states, except Assam, and the union territories, except Delhi, the proportion of the urban population is less than 1 per cent.

Given the macro level trend at the country level, let us see urbanisation trends within different states. According to the 1961 Census, the largest proportion of the population living in the urban areas is in the National Capital Territory of Delhi (88.75 per cent). The following eight states and union territories together account for more than 20 per cent of the population living in the urban areas—Punjab (36.72 per cent), Maharashtra (28.22 per cent), Tamil Nadu (26.69 per cent), Gujarat (25.77 per cent), West Bengal (24.45 per cent), Pondicherry (24.11 per cent), Karnataka (22.33 per cent) and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (22.15 per cent). The other seven states have more than 10 per cent of the urban population—Andhra Pradesh (17.44 per cent), Jammu & Kashmir (16.66 per cent), Rajasthan (16.28 per cent), Goa, Daman and Diu (16.06 per cent), Kerala (15.11 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (14.29 per cent), and Uttar Pradesh (12.85 per cent). The remaining states and union territories has less than 10 per cent—Assam, Bihar, Himachal

Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland, Orissa, Sikkim and Tripura (Table 3.16). In short, only nine states and union territories have more than one-fifth of the population living in the urban areas in 1961.

Nevertheless, this trend has changed over the period. In 2011, the largest proportion of the population living in the urban areas is Delhi with 97.50 per cent followed by Chandigarh with 97.25 per cent. In most of the union territories, such as Lakshadweep (78.07 per cent), Daman and Diu (75.17 per cent) and Pondicherry (68.33 per cent), more than 60–70 per cent of the population is living in the urban areas. Among the states, Goa (62.17 per cent) has the largest urban population followed by Mizoram (52.11 per cent). Among the major states, the proportion of urban population was high in Tamil Nadu (48.40 per cent), Kerala (47.70 per cent), Maharashtra (45.22 per cent) and Gujarat (42.60 per cent). In the highly populated states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the proportion of the urban population was very low with 22.27 per cent and 11.29 per cent respectively. In all other states, the proportion of the urban population was between 20 and 30 per cent.

## *HEALTH COMMITTEES/COMMISSIONS DURING THE POST-INDEPENDENCE PERIOD*

After the Independence, the Government of India formed several committees and commissions to suggest appropriate measures to improve the health conditions. The prominent Committees include Bhore Committee (1946), Mudaliar Committee (1961), Chadha Committee (1963), Mukherjee Committee (1965), Jungalwalla Committee (1967), Kartar Singh Committee (1973) and Srivastava Committee (1975).

### **Bhore Committee (1946)**

The Report of the Health Survey and Development Committee (1946), popularly known as the Bhore Committee, was appointed by the Government of India in October 1943 to conduct: '(a) a broad survey of the present position in regard to health conditions and health organisation in British India, and (b) make recommendations for future developments.'29

This Committee has concluded that the prevailing insanitary conditions, malnutrition, and inadequacy of the existing medical and preventive health organisations as the main causes responsible for poor health conditions of the people. The committee suggested that the integrated of preventive and curative services should be extended to all citizens to prohibit the unethical private practice by whole‐time salaried doctors in the long run. Further, it proposed that no individual should fail to secure adequate medical care, i.e., both curative and preventive, and that special provision should be given to mothers, children and mentally deficient persons. In the long run, it recommended the setting up of a Primary Health Unit with one controlling medical officer, five other medical officers, seventy-eight nonmedical staff and seventy-five bedded hospitals for each 10,000 to 20,000 population; the Secondary Unit with one controlling medical officer, 139 other medical officers, 358 non-medical staff and 650 bedded hospital for 300,000 population; in the District Headquarters, one controlling medical officer, 238 other medical officers, 1,398 non-medical staff and 2,500 bedded hospital. It also recommended that the total number of hospital beds for the given population of 3 million would be 17,000 or a ratio of 5.67 beds per 1,000 population.

In the short-term plan, the committee suggested that the three types of organisations or a three-tier structure for general health services, viz., Primary Health Units, Secondary Health Units and the District Health Units, which were to be developed within a decade. It also further suggested that certain special health services for diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, venereal disease, leprosy, nutrition, etc. should be provided. It also advised three months training in preventive and social medicine to prepare 'social physicians'. Simultaneously, it aimed to impart health education at school level. It also envisaged developing the health programme and infrastructure to control the communicable diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, small pox, cholera, plague, leprosy, venereal disease, etc. It also emphasised upon policy measures to control population growth rate. To conclude, it was suggested that the government should give the highest priority for health programmes towards realisation of a reduction in sickness and mortality rates among mothers and children and also underscored that the government should spend a minimum of 15 per cent of their revenue on health improvement-related welfare activities. Succinctly, this committee outlined the plan to develop health infrastructure in order to provide better health facilities to the general public at large.

#### **Mudaliar Committee (1961)30**

The Health Survey and Planning Committee was formed under the chairmanship of A.L. Mudaliar and the main objective of the

committee was to assess the performance of the health sector since the submission of Bhore Committee Report and also to formulate further health programmes for the country. The committee also found that the conditions in Primary Health Centres (PHCs) were unsatisfactory and suggested to strengthen the PHCs before new ones were established. Further, it proposed to develop one PHC for 40,000 population with better infrastructure, i.e., ten beds with two beds for the emergency and one ambulance. Curative, preventive and promotive services were to be be provided at PHCs. It also planned to develop the taluk-level headquarter hospitals with minimum bed strength of about fifty and which have on their staff rolls at least three medical officers dealing with medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology. It also emphasised on the need to develop the district headquarter hospitals with about 500 to 750 beds facility in each district and to provide the special hospitals for specialists, paediatrics, maternity, communicable diseases, deafness and dental services. In addition to the health infrastructural facilities, it also emphasised on the provision of water supply and sanitation facilities to the rural and urban areas and envisaged one medical college per 5 million population. The Family Planning Programme too has to be effectively implemented. This Committee had, in effect, emphasised on both health infrastructure facilities of various types of medical practices as well as medical institutions in this country, and proposed that at least 10 per cent of the total outlay be earmarked for medical facilities.

### **Chadha Committee (1963)31**

This Committee was appointed under the Chairmanship of Dr M.S. Chadha to advice on the necessary arrangements for the maintenance phase of National Malaria Eradication Programme. It suggested that the vigilance activities should be carried out by basic health workers, members of *panchayats,* Block Development Committees, *mahila mandals*, youth clubs and other voluntary agencies and teachers. It also suggested that one basic health worker should cover not more than 10,000 populations leading to the establishment of sub-centres of a PHC, with a midwife or auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM). In addition to that, three to four basic health workers should also be there for additional duties, to collect vital statistics and execute family planning concepts under the supervision of a family planning health assistant. It further suggested the forming of a systematic administrative structure for Malaria Eradication Programme. Thus, the district laboratories/ headquarter hospitals should have facilities for the examination of blood smears at rural health centres and they should be available free of charge and suggested to improve dispensaries and PHCs.

# **Mukherjee Committee (1965)32**

The Mukherjee Committee was appointed to review the performance of family planning. The committee recommend that there should be a separate cell in the State Secretariat for dealing exclusively with the Family Planning Programme. It also recommended that basic health workers should be utilised for purposes other than the Family Planning Programme. It also suggested that a strong executive agency should be created in the form of a Health Directorate in each state government, set up to deal exclusively with the Family Planning Programme. Malaria eradication activities should be separated from the Family Planning Programme. The committee also emphasised on the need for accelerating the training of paramedical personnel, nurses, ANMs, etc. required for the Family Planning Programme. Essentially, it has laid special focus on encouraging the Family Planning Programme.

# **Mukherjee Committee (1966)33**

The Mukherjee Committee was headed by Shri Mukherjee who was the Union Health Secretary to the government on the development of multiple activities of mass programmes like family planning, small pox, leprosy, trachoma, malaria (maintenance phase), etc. It recommends that there should be one basic health worker for a population of 10,000 and for every four basic health workers, there should be a health inspector who would provide close supervision and guidance to the basic health workers. It further advised that in urban areas, there should be one basic health worker for every 15,000 population and 10,000 population for the rural areas. It further recommended the expansion of facilities with the addition of a rural Family Planning Centre at each PHC, one sub-centre for 10,000 population manned by a trained ANM and one lady health visitor (LHV) to supervise and guide the work of four sub-centres.

# **Jungalwalla Committee (1967)34**

In 1964, the 'Committee on Integration of Health Services' was set up under the chairmanship of Dr N. Jungalwalla and the main objective of this committee was to look into various problems related to the integration of health services, abolition of private practice by doctors in government services and the service conditions of doctors. It also made the recommendations to address the issues and problems appropriately.

## **Kartar Singh Committee (1973)35**

In 1973, Kartar Singh Committee was constituted to form a framework for integration of health and medical services at peripheral and supervisory levels. Accordingly, the committee suggested measures for the integration of services and monitoring levels for the entire organisations.

# **Srivastava Committee (1975)36**

In 1974, Dr J.B. Srivastava Committee was appointed to study the problems of medical education in accordance with national needs and priorities and develop a curriculum for health assistants who were to function as a link between medical officers and multi-purpose workers (MPWs).

# *HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT IN INDIA, 1951–2001*

After Independence, Government of India gave highest priority to improve the health infrastructure facilities in terms of doctors, nurses, hospitals and dispensaries, sub-centres, PHCs, community health centres and hospitals beds. The number of doctors in allopathy was only 61,800 in 1951 which increased to 503,900 in 2000. Likewise, the number of nurses also have increased from 18,054 to 737,000 for the same period. The number of sub-centres, PHCs and community health centres was only 725 in 1951 which increased to 163,181 in 2000. The number of hospitals and dispensaries was only 9,209 in 1951 which increased to 43,322 in 2000. The number of hospital beds, both in the government as well as private hospitals, has increased from 117,198 to 870,161 for the same period (Table 3.17).

| Particulars                      | 1950    | 2000    |

**Table 3.17:** Health Infrastructures in India, 1950–2000

*Source*: National Health Policy, 2002.

In addition to the health infrastructural facilities, several health programmes were also introduced under different five-year plans. Further, the government has resolved to improve the water supply and sanitation facilities. Consequently, the demographic profile of India has changed drastically due to the vast improvements in health infrastructural facilities that had occurred during the post-Independence period. Around the 1970s, a major shift in health policies that gave priority to the prevention aspects than that of curative part of the diseases. For example, the Integrated Child Development Projects (ICDS) was implemented. The national health policies were framed. Accordingly, PHCs were established within three kilometres of habitation. Further, the housing and household amenities, such as living space, kitchen, toilet, lighting, fuel, drinking water, drainage, etc., have also gained momentum during the last three or four decades. Consequently, the demographic profiles have changed during the post-Independence period.

### **Demographic Profile**

#### *Birth Rate*

After Independence, the birth rate has declined from 42.10 in 1960 to 19.01 in 2016. The decline in birth rate was gradual over the six decades. The birth rate has declined due to family planning as well as increase in literacy rate and other awareness programmes.

### *Death Rate*

The death rate has also declined from 22.80 in 1950 to 7.31 in 2016. The death rate has also declined not only due to the improvement in the health infrastructural facilities but also due to various poverty alleviation programmes besides the introduction of public distribution system during the post-Independence period.

### *Infant Mortality Rate*

Infant mortality rate has declined from 164 in 1960 to 34.6 in 2016. This decline is not only due to health infrastructural facilities but also state intervention measures to reduce infant mortality like the ICDS programme.

### *Life Expectancy*

Life expectancy has increased remarkably from 41.17 in 1960 to 68.56 in 2016. At the time of Independence, the person living below the poverty line was about 50 per cent and it has decreased to 25 per cent despite the high population growth. Various programmes like old age pensions, public distribution system and other supportive

mechanisms initiated by the government have increased over a period of time during the post-Independence period (Table 3.18).

| Year | <b>Birth Rate</b> | Death<br>Rate | <b>Infant Mortality</b><br>Rate | Life Expectancy<br>at Birth |
|------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|

### *POPULATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT*

The previous sections dealt with the trend of population growth from precolonial, colonial and post-Independence periods. This section will analyse the population and its consequences for the environment from the precolonial, colonial and postcolonial periods, i.e., from the mideighteenth century to the early twenty-first century.

# **Precolonial period**

Until the colonial intervention, the population density was low despite the rampant people migration from other geographical boundaries. Consequently, the exploitation of natural resources was very limited. Indeed, not only was the density of population low but also their needs and requirements were very limited. In other words, their livelihood options were confined to subsistence levels and they were met with hunting, extraction of forest resources and cultivation. To ensure their subsistence, they have developed several ponds and tanks which were maintained by the communities themselves. The rulers also have developed these facilities. Travelling was supported by the *choultaries*. The livelihood options of the different communities were interlinked and interdependent on each other. The farmers cultivated different cereals that were supported by the different service providing
communities; for instance, water distribution and maintenance of the canal work were carried out by the *nirkaties* and he was rewarded or awarded after the harvesting season on an annual basis. The blacksmith, who used to make ploughing materials, carts, other carpenter work, etc., were paid on an annual basis. The other household requirements like, pots, washing, water lifting devices etc. were supplied by the potter, washer men, *chakilliar*<sup>38</sup> respectively. In other words, the people lived helping each other and mainly for the livelihood purposes.

This kind of traditional arrangement prevailed in one or the other form invariably in different parts of the Indian subcontinent. Trade and commerce with the other countries also was carried out to a very limited extent. Even within the country, trade- and commerce-related activities were undertaken on a weekly basis, mainly with the exchange of goods and commodities. These exchanges happened through the traditional mode of transport like bullock carts, horses, donkeys and other means. Consequently, the population on the environment was very trivial and limited impact on the environment during the precolonial period. Hence, vast extents of the areas were unoccupied and large extent of common property resources bound in different parts of the country. In other words, population density was low and the people requirements were also limited and, therefore, there was no environmental threat until the colonial intervention.

## **Colonial Period**

Unlike the precolonial period, during the colonial times, people and trade and commerce have made serious impact on the ecology and environment. The colonial period has to be looked at in two different phases. The first phase is until the First War of Independence or the 1857 Revolt/Mutiny and the second phase is from the late nineteenth century till the mid-twentieth century.

From the late eighteenth century till the mid-nineteenth century, the population remained stable but the expansion of agriculture took place, forest resources were exploited for commercial purpose and commercial crops like tea and coffee plantations were established largely in the highlands, besides establishing iron and sugar manufacturing industries.39 However, these impacts on environment confined only to a few geographical reasons. For example, teak and other species were taken over by the colonial administration during the early nineteenth century in the Cochin and Travancore region. Sandalwood was extracted in the entire southern peninsula. Tea plantations were established in northern parts of West Bengal, Assam and Kerala. Coffee plantations were established in the elevated hill ranges of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu

and Andhra Pradesh. Precisely, during the first phase of the colonial period, population remained stable and the agricultural expansion and exploitation of the forest resources for commercial purposes and the growing of commercial crops was being encouraged. However, extraction and exploitation were confined to a few pockets and, hence, the impact on the ecology and environment was also very limited.

The second phase of the colonial period was very important as far as the environment point of view was concerned as it has made a severe impact on both the ecology and environment. The first and foremost impact was that of introduction of the railways from 1853 onwards. The railway network was expanded to about 40,000 miles at the end of the colonial era. It is to be pointed out that this railway network was developed mainly for the commercial purpose and hence the majority of the railway network connected with the port cities like Karachi, Mumbai, Cochin, Chennai and Kolkata. The development of the railway network not only destroyed forests which were felled to lay down the tracks and to make timber plates, coaches and fuelwood. Invariably, to a large extent, the forest recourses were either destroyed or exploited for the development of railways in different parts of the country. In addition to this, the railway network paved the way to extract various resources and export them to other countries.

Since the last quarter of the nineteenth century, reserve forest was introduced to protect the environment but commercial exploitation continued to be the main agenda of the colonial administration until the mid-twentieth century.40 The rights of people who depended on the forest resources for their livelihood were severely curtailed during the entire colonial period. While establishing the tea and coffee plantations in different parts of the country since the second quarter of the nineteenth century tribals and other forest-dwelling communities rights were not only encroached upon but also questioned their occupancy and community management systems. However, since the last quarter of the nineteenth century more and more highlands were brought under the reserve forest without considering occupancy rights of tribals and other forest-dwelling communities. Consequently, several tribal revolts occurred against the colonial administration from the beginning to the end of the colonial rule. Over the 150 years of the colonial rule, more than 130 tribal revolts have occurred in different parts of the country in different points of time.

The main agenda of the colonialism is to explore the virgin lands to extract the natural resources and secure maximisation of their profit by exploiting the colony people. Hence, they have introduced the permanent settlement system in the early nineteenth century to ensure the constant and assured revenue sources.<sup>41</sup> In the process, colonialism paved the way not only to develop the feudal system but also the capitalist

set-up, invariably in different parts of the country. The EIC expected the regular and assured revenue but the zamindars collected/extracted more revenue from the people and remitted less money to the EIC. In other words, neither the motives of the EIC were achieved nor the common people were protected but the zamindars (middlemen) accumulated huge amount of money and emerged as capitalists from the early nineteenth century onwards. This zamindari background people were educated in England and at a later point of time emerged as nationalist leaders. In other words, those who received education in England were mainly from the feudalist/capitalist background and later they have emerged as leaders of nationalist sentiments. Those who exploited the people and manipulated the Britishers have emerged as protectors of the common people.

It is important to know that who these leaders are—who played a prominent role in India's freedom movement and was this movement for the interest of the common people or in interest of the elite groups, who wants to sustain and enjoy the privileges of exploitation and raised their voices against the Britishers. In fact, India's freedom movement was by and large led by those who exploited the common people within the country and outsiders of the country, such as the Europeans. I am making this statement because the real freedom fighters are the tribals who fought against the British intervention from the late eighteenth century and continued to fight till the mid-twentieth century. Unfortunately, their concerns and their struggles were however undermined by the feudal and capitalistic leaders until the last phase of the freedom struggle.

## **Post-Independence Period**

At the time of Independence, the total population was about 36 crores and it has increased to 121 crores in 2011. Due to the increase in population, agricultural expansion took place. The area under cultivation has increased from 118.75 million hectares in 1950–1951 to 141.56 million hectares in 2011. The net area under irrigation also increased several folds, i.e., from 20.83 million hectares in 1950–1951 to 63.66 million hectares in 2010–2011. In addition to that, the demand for domestic water supply has increased several folds. Electricity not only for agriculture and industry but also domestic needs has also increased several folds. To meet the increasing demand, we have developed several dams which have submerged a large extent of forest land and also displaced several million people. Consequently, every basin and sub-basin became a closed basin in different parts of the country. In addition to the several dams, extraction of groundwater has also reached

the maximum level resulting in desertification of several regions. The phenomenal growth of urbanisation and industrialisation during the post-Independence period not only increased the demand for water but also increased water pollution posing a serious threat not only for the surface water but also for groundwater. The number of vehicles and its quantity of emissions have also increased several folds during the post-Independence period.

## *CONCLUSION*

Population is an important and fundamental factor to maintain a sustainable environment and other natural resources. Since the population density was low and the peoples' requirement was mainly confined to livelihood options, there was little or no threat to either the ecology or environment. Because of frequent famines, internal warfare, and epidemics like cholera and plague, their lifespan was not secured and loss of life has led to the low population growth. From the early seventeenth century to the mid-seventeenth century, the population of the Indian subcontinent was about 100 million. In the subsequent centuries (the 1750s), the population has increased to 130–160 million. The population has increased further to 140–200 million in 1800.

As I mentioned earlier, India's economy was mainly a subsistence economy. However, a limited trade and commerce exchange between the countries was being held from the early period. Even when Vasco da Gama reached Malabar in 1498, the ruler has shown interest in the exchange of products. In other words, the people or ruler had shown interest to exchange their products with the other countries. As such, there was no threat to the ecology and environment. Though the trading with Europeans from the sixteenth century to the mid-eighteenth century, goods and commodities had been exchanged and there was no threat to the ecology and environment. In other words, as long as the Europeans engaged Indians with trade and commerce, there was no threat to the ecosystem.

Since the mid-eighteenth century, the Britishers started to exercise power and mainly focused on land revenue. Since the last decade of the eighteenth century, in addition to enhancing the land revenue, they began to control the natural resources which had ecological and environmental consequences. Although the British administration was willing to reduce the tax during the famine, but they were never really concerned about the people of the country. On the one hand, they have designed different strategies to enhance the land revenue while, on the other hand, they were never concerned about the famines and other epidemic diseases. Consequently, a large number of people lost their lives since the mid-eighteenth century to the midtwentieth century, i.e., over two centuries. Famines that occurred in the 1770s, the 1790s, 1818, 1823, 1834, 1854, 1865, 1876–1878, 1899 and 1901 showed that the preventive measures were not adequately adopted to protect the population, despite the establishing of the Famine Commissioner.

According to the population estimates of the mid-eighteenth century, the total population was about 130–160 million in 1750 and 140–200 million in 1800. In the subsequent 120 years, India's population has increased to only 251 million in 1921. In other words, the population was 238 million in 1871 and it has increased to 251 million in 1921, and within the five decades the population has increased only to 13 million. It clearly indicates that the colonial administration was concerned only of extraction of the natural resources and taxes from the Indians and they were least concerned about the human beings. Hence, the death rates, birth rates and infant mortality rates were very high and the longevity at birth was very low during the colonial period. Precisely, the colonial administration over the 200 years was never concerned about the population of Indian subcontinent and their main agenda was only to extract the resources from the people and transport them. As a result, there was no change in the population growth over the two centuries of the colonial era.

As against the colonial administration, India's independent governments gave priority to protect the population by providing the food grains by expansion of agriculture, and generating the employment opportunities through the poverty alleviations programmes and improved the infrastructural facilities like schools, hospitals, roads, drinking water supply and household amenities. The post-Independence government plans and programmes centred on population and resulted in the decline of death rates, birth rates and infant mortality rates, leading to drastic improvement in longevity, which became at par with the developed countries. Despite the tremendous improvement in the demographic profile of over the six decades, the environment and ecological damage factors have not received the due importance supposed that they to deserved.
