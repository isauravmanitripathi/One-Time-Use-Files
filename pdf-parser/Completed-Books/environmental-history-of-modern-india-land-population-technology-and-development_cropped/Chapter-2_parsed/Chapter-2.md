### LAND-USE PATTERN AND THE ENVIRONMENT

This chapter analyse the trends of land-use pattern in India from the late eighteenth to that of the early twenty-first centuries in a historical perspective. Since the early nineteenth century, the establishment of tea, coffee and teak wood plantations paved the way for changes in the land-use pattern of the non-arable areas in different parts of the country. Otherwise, till the first half of the nineteenth century, the land-use pattern has not changed much due to the low density of population and lack of infrastructural facilities. Since the midnineteenth century, invariably, common property resources were brought under arable land areas, mainly due to agricultural expansion. With improved irrigation methods and facilities despite the series of famines and droughts during the second half of the nineteenth century—though in the early phase, agricultural expansion took place—the net sown area more or less remained the same till the third decade of the twentieth century.

However, during the post-Independence period, the land-use pattern has changed drastically due to the population explosion, agricultural expansion, technological advancement and rapid development of infrastructural facilities. Consequently, the changing trend of land-use pattern and its implications for ecology, environment and biodiversity resources were rampant. This chapter, therefore, attempts to capture the nature and trends of land-use pattern and its consequences on ecology and environment, from the late eighteenth to that of the early twenty-first centuries in a historical perspective.

This chapter consists of five sections. The first section gives a brief account of the land-use pattern during the precolonial period. The second section analyses the changing land-use pattern during the colonial period (1800–1947). The third section deals with the trends of land-use pattern during the post-Independence period (1947–2017). The fourth section traces the trend of land-use pattern in different states during the post-Independence period (1947–2017) and the last section ends with the concluding observations.

#### *UNTIL THE COLONIAL PERIOD (AROUND 1800)*

The surface of the earth has changed considerably over the last half century due to urbanisation, deforestation and intensive agricultural practices.<sup>1</sup> Consequently, conversion of grassland, woodland and forest into cropland and pasture has risen during the same period.<sup>2</sup> Since 1850, the global population has increased six times and urban population had increased more than 100 times.<sup>3</sup> Change in land-use pattern of a particular country in a given time depends on several factors, such as technology, economics, environmental factors and patterns of development.<sup>4</sup> For instance, major irrigation projects brought more land under cultivation while rural and urban growth and infrastructural development reduced the overall area under cultivation.<sup>5</sup>

In the developing countries, the availability of arable land has declined due to population growth.<sup>6</sup> Since the early seventeenth century to the mid-nineteenth century (1600–1850), various estimates of the size of the population show that the population has increased. It also indicates that in the first half of the seventeenth century, the population has either declined or remained stagnant. Since the second half of the seventeenth century, various estimates show that, invariably, the population has increased till the mid-nineteenth century. Of course, the growth rate is varied among different estimates.<sup>7</sup> In other words, the population has increased in the Indian subcontinent from 100 million in 1600–1650 to 130–160 million in 1750, 140–200 million in 1800 and 190-240 million in 1850s.<sup>8</sup> During the precolonial period, the land-use pattern has not changed due to low population and lack of technology in the Indian subcontinent. For example, in the Salem and Baramahal regions, a vast extent of the land was unutilised at the close of the eighteenth century. In 1793, the total geographical area of this region was 4,092,973 acres which included 1,127,716 acres (27.55 per cent) of arable land, 359,279 acres (8.78 per cent) of fallow land, 1,559,612 acres (38.1 per cent) of cultivable wasteland and 1,046,366 acres (25.56 per cent) of uncultivable wasteland.<sup>9</sup> However, during the first half of the nineteenth century, favourable conditions prevailed for population growth not only due to political stability in the country but also because of the famine relief operations that were undertaken.10

The population growth was nearly stagnant till the early seventeenth century. Then it has increased marginally till the mid-eighteenth century and subsequently it was more or less stagnant due to epidemics and political turmoil till the nineteenth century. However, later, the atmosphere favoured the population growth due to containment of natural calamities by the colonial administration. The people were forced to move from one place to another due to natural calamities and political turmoil since the early seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. Consequently, there was little impact on the land-use pattern until the colonial intervention or till the late eighteenth century.

### *TRENDS OF LAND-USE PATTERN (1800–1947)*

Land-use pattern has changed remarkably in the Indian subcontinent during the colonial period due to the establishment of tea and coffee plantations, expansion of cultivated area, expansion of irrigation facilities and commercialisation of agriculture, besides development of various infrastructural facilities. Since the second quarter of the nineteenth century, establishment of the tea and coffee and plantations paved way for changes in the land-use pattern, particularly non-arable areas, in different parts of the country. The East India Company (EIC) has encouraged the British administrators and judges to establish tea and coffee plantations by offering incentives and privileges. About 12.08 lakh acres (8.7 lakh acres coffee and 3.38 lakh acres tea), largely in the elevated ranges, were brought under the plantation in different parts of the country.11 Further, the East India Irrigation Company gave priority to the establishment of large dams during the 1840s and also developed several dams in the second half of the nineteenth century. For example, in 1880–1881, the length of main canals in the five provinces was about 6,755 miles that increased to 14.483 miles in 1895–1896, and the irrigated area also increased from 59.54 lakh acres to 134.20 lakh acres for the same period.12 Since the second half of the nineteenth century, the railway network was gradually developed in different parts of the country by the nine private British companies, which encroached upon a huge extent of the forest lands not only to lay down tracks but also to exploit vast forest resources in different parts of the country. Till the mid-nineteenth century, about 40,000 miles of railway network was developed in the Indian subcontinent. Since the last quarter of the nineteenth century, several tracts of forest lands were brought under the reserve forest/protected forest lands under the Indian Forest Act of 1878. However, since the early twentieth century, no major initiative was undertaken by the colonial administration due to drought, World Wars and Depression.

While referring to the mid-eighteenth century scenario, Raychaudhuri points out that: 'The performance of even the subsistenceoriented agriculture was quite high, no doubt owing to the availability of very fertile land for a relatively small population rather than to any technological excellence'.13 Since the mid-eighteenth century to till the nineteenth century, the population growth was little not only due to the natural calamities but also because of political turmoil and internal conflicts.14

Until the mid-nineteenth century, the demand for land had not aroused due to low population and, in fact, landowners were looking for the tenants for cultivation. According to Hunter, 'In ancient times, and until three-quarters of a century of British rule had passed, overpopulation was unknown in India. The demand was by the land-holders for tenants, not by the husbandman for land.<sup>15</sup> He pointed out that even in the fertile Gangetic basin, a large extent of the land was unoccupied towards the end of the eighteenth century. According to him:

At the end of the last century about one-third of Lower Bengal, and probably half of the Panjab, lay unoccupied. The Central Provinces lay half unoccupied on the south, Assam lay unoccupied on the north. How came it that this great breeding-ground, with every cause of the increase of an Indian population in full development, was thus surrounded by almost unoccupied provinces, while within its own districts the competition was by landlords for cultivators, not by cultivators for land?16

Since the mid-nineteenth century onwards, the land-use pattern has changed remarkably with the conversion of forests, woodlands, grasslands and desert lands into arable land due to agricultural expansion and irrigation facilities.<sup>17</sup> For example, in the Madras Presidency, the cultivated land has increased from 12 million acres in 1853 to 20 million acres in 1878. In other words, about two-thirds of the cultivated land have increased within twenty-five years (1853–1878).<sup>18</sup> Consequently, the net sown area has increased from 1,801.5 lakh acres in 1899–1900 to 2,800.21 lakh acres in 1939–1940. The proportion of the net sown area to the total geographical area has increased from about 33 per cent to 42 per cent respectively for the same period. In other words, the growth rate of net sown area was about 54 per cent in four decades, 1899–1900 to 1939–1940. While bringing more land into cultivation, some extent of land was converted for human settlement and transportation purposes and also forests and woodlands had been exploited for the commercial purposes.<sup>19</sup>

### **Total Geographical Area**

The total geographical area has increased during the colonial period. In 1899–1900, the total geographical area was 5,477.14 lakh areas and it has increased in the subsequent decades. In 1909–1910, it has increased

to 6,217.28 lakh acres; 6,224.68 lakh acres in 1919–1920; 6,675.14 lakh acres in 1929–1930; and 6,696.48 lakh acres in 1939–1940. The total geographical area has increased over 22.26 per cent between 1899–1900 and 1939–1940 (Table 2.1).

# **Area under Forest**

Available data clearly indicates an increase in forest cover from 658.43 lakh acres or 12.02 per cent of the total geographical area in 1899–1900 to 815.85 lakh acres or 13.75 per cent in 1946–1947. In other words, the proportion of forest area to the total geographical area has witnessed a marginal increase during this period. During the post-Forest Act regime, a large extent of forest land was brought under the reserve forest area in the Indian subcontinent. For instance, forest area has increased to 811.89 lakh acres in 1909–1910, 883.23 lakh acres in 1919–1920, 872.76 lakh acres in 1929–1930 and 872.16 lakh acres in 1939–1940.

By the end of 1881–82 there were 46,213 square miles of Reserved and 8,612 square miles of Protected Forests; with the close of 1884– 85 there were 49,214 square miles of former and 13,103 square miles of latter class. As the end of 1897–98 the area had increased to 81,414 square miles of Reserves and had decreased to 8,845 square miles of protected forests.20

Within two decades of the nineteenth century, 658.43 lakh acres of land was brought under the forest cover. In the subsequent decades of the colonial era, the area under forest has constantly increased and its proportion to the total geographical area also has increased. Precisely, more and more areas were brought under the forest cover during the colonial period, particularly since the last quarter of the nineteenth century.

# **Agriculture Expansion**

Expansion of agriculture was notable in the Indian subcontinent especially during the post-Forest Act period. Despite an increase in current fallows, the net sown area has gone up progressively during this period. For instance, in 1899–1900, 1,801.50 lakh acres of land was under the net sown area and it has shot up to 2,427.75 lakh acres in 1946–1947. In other words, the proportion of net sown area, which was 33 per cent of the total geographical area in 1899–1900, has risen to 40.91 per cent in 1946–1947. This was proof that more and more land was brought under the cultivation during the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century in the Indian subcontinent. The net sown area has increased 55.44 per cent between 1899–1900 and 1939–1940 (Table 2.1).

## **Decline of Common Land**

The overall trend of common land that included the area under forest, area that was not available for cultivation and uncultivated land other than fallow land has declined during the post-Forest Act colonial period. Since the last decade of the nineteenth century, the common land has increased progressively until the third decade of the twentieth century and after that it has declined remarkably. In 1890– 1891, the area under common land was about 261,979,365 acres and this has increased to 390,181,178 acres in 1931–1932. In other words, the growth rate of common land was about 48.94 per cent during the four decades. Invariably, different types of common land like forest area that was not available for cultivation and uncultivated land other than fallow land has increased during this period (Table 2.1). Prior to 1935–1936, Burma region was also included. Since then, the total common land and invariably different types of common land have declined remarkably in the Indian subcontinent. It clearly indicates that after the third decade of the twentieth century, more and more common lands, particularly area that was not available for cultivation and uncultivated land other than fallow land, were brought under cultivation.

## **Increase of Current Fallow**

Area under current fallows has declined during the first three decades of the twentieth century and it has increased since the fourth decade onwards. In 1899–1900, about 10.44 per cent of the area falls under the current fallow and it has declined to 7.29 per cent in 1909–1910; 8.38 per cent in 1919–1920; 7.45 per cent in 1929–1930 and 9.26 per cent in 1939–1940. In 1946–1947, it has increased to 14.76 per cent.

#### **Net Sown Area**

Since the mid-nineteenth century, several frequent famines and droughts affected the Indian subcontinent. Further, between 1850 and 1900, more than fifty droughts occurred in the country. Most of the famines and droughts affected the most parts of the country. Consequently, only one-third of the geographical area was brought under the net sown area. The net sown area has not changed despite the existence of only a few famines during the first three decades of the twentieth century. The net sown area has increased from 1,801.5 lakh acres in 1899–1900 to 2,800.21 lakh acres in 1939–1940. The growth rate of net sown area has increased about more than 55 per cent within four decades of the twentieth century (Table 2.1). In fact,

in the first three decades, the net sown area more or less remained constant. During the period from 1930 to 1940, the net sown area has increased from 2,281.62 lakh acres to 2,800.21 acres in 1939–1940. The frequent famines and droughts during the second half of the nineteenth century and early decade of the twentieth century led to the net sown area remaining constant in the Indian subcontinent.<sup>21</sup> Since the early twentieth century, more geographical area was brought under the colonial administration. At the same time, more area was brought under the forest and the agricultural expansion has also increased remarkably, but the other common property resources have declined remarkably during the colonial period.

## *POST-INDEPENDENCE PERIOD (1947–2017)*

#### **Reporting Area**

At the time of Independence, the total geographical area of the Indian subcontinent was about 328.73 million hectares; however, only an area of 284.32 million hectares was brought under the land utilisation statistics. During the post-Independence period, vast areas have been brought under the land utilisation statistics. For instance, in 1950–1951, about 284.32 million hectares land was brought under the land utilisation statistics. It has increased in the subsequent decades: i.e., 298.46 million hectares in 1960–1961; 303.75 million hectares in 1970–1971; 304.16 million hectares in 1980–1981; 304.86 million hectares in 1990–1991; 305.19 million hectares in 2000–2001 and 307.48 million hectares in 2010–2011. In other words, the growth rate of land utilisation area in the Indian subcontinent was about 8.15 per cent within six decades, i.e., between 1950–1951 and 2010–2011 (Table 2.2).

# **Area under Forest**

Since the last quarter of the nineteenth century, greater area was brought under the forest; however, the area under forest has increased remarkably only during the post-Independence period. In 1950–1951 only 40.48 million hectares, which constitutes about 14.24 per cent of the total land utilisation statistics areas, has increased to 71.59 million hectares, which constitutes of 23.28 per cent in 2010–2011. In other words, the growth rate of forest was about 76.85 per cent between 1950– 1951 and 2010–2011. However, in the first three decades of the post-Independence period, more than 57 per cent of the area was added into the forest. In the subsequent decades, the growth rate was very meagre. In fact, a little more than three-fourths of the forest area were added to the forest during the last six decades of the post-Independence period (Table 2.2).

During the first three decades of post-Independence period (1950– 1980), 26.98 million hectares or about 57 per cent of the additional area was brought under the forest, while on an average of 4.5 million hectares of forest (0.15 million hectares) per year was diverted for various development programmes during the same period. Between 1980 and 2016, about 3.32 million hectares of area was brought under the forest and at the same time, 0.89 million hectares was diverted for various development purposes. In other words, during the post-Forest Conservation period (1980–2016), on an average, about 0.025 million hectares of forest per year was diverted for various development purposes.

#### **Area Not Available for Cultivation**

In the category of land not available for cultivation that consists of land put to non-agricultural use and barren and unculturable land has declined marginally from 47.52 million hectares in 1950–1951 to 43.58 million hectares in 2010–2011. But within this category, the former increased from 9.36 million hectares in 1950–1951 to 26.4 million hectares in 2010–2011, whereas the latter declined from 38.16 million hectares to 17.18 million hectares for the same period. With reference to land put to non-agricultural use, growth rate was about 182 per cent between 1950–1951 and 2010–2011 (Table 2.2). The 'Area not available for cultivation' is an important category which impacted both due to population explosion and agricultural expansion during the post-Independence period. Due to population explosion, more and more area was brought under not only for habitation purpose but also for the development of various infrastructural facilities like schools, colleges, hospitals, government offices, roads, etc. For example, at the time of Independence, there were only about 644 lakh households and it has increased to 3,308.35 lakh households in 2011. Population has increased from 36 crores in 1951 to 121 crores in 2011. The number of villages has increased from 5.58 lakh villages in 1951 to 6.4 lakh villages in 2011. The number of towns has also increased from 3,018 in 1951 to 7,935 in 2011. The number of schools, colleges, other academic or research institutions and common facilities have increased remarkably during the post-Independence period. Consequently, land being put to non-agricultural use has increased during the post-Independence period.

#### **Other Uncultivated Land**

Other uncultivated land, viz., permanent pasture and other grazing lands, miscellaneous tree crops and groves, and culturable wastelands, nearly halved from 49.45 million hectares in 1950–1951 to 26.15

million hectares in 2010–2011. The proportion of other uncultivated land to the reported area of land utilisation has come down from 17.39 per cent in 1950–1951 to 8.59 per cent in 2010–2011. Land under miscellaneous tree crops and groves and culturable wasteland has declined from 19.83 and 22.94 million hectares in 1950–1951 to 3.2 and 12.65 million hectares in 2010–2011 respectively (Table 2.2). As against the land under miscellaneous tree crops and groves and culturable wasteland, permanent pastures and other grazing lands have increased from 6.68 million hectares in 1950–1951 to 10.3 million hectares in 2010–2011. The miscellaneous tree crops and groves and culturable wastelands have been brought under the cultivation and development of various infrastructural facilities during the post-Independence period.

## **Net Sown Area**

Since Independence, agriculture expansion was emphasised upon to eradicate poverty. Consequently, more and more lands were brought under the cultivation process. In other words, barren and unculturable land was brought under cultivation, particularly during the green revolution period, which was supported by the technological advancement in the agrarian sector. Consequently, net area sown has increased from 118.7 million hectares in 1950–1951 to 141.56 million hectares in 2010–2011. In other words, net area sown growth rate was about 19.26 per cent during the last six decades. About one-fifth of the net sown area has increased during the post-Independence period. Not only has the net sown area increased but also area sown has increased more than once from 13.15 million hectares in 1950– 1951 to 56 million hectares in 2010–2011. In other words, area sown more than once has increased fourfold during the post-Independence period.

## **Fallow Land**

This increased despite the declining trend of follow lands during the same period.

## **Net Irrigated Area**

At the same time, the gross irrigated area increased fourfold from 22.56 million hectares in 1950–1951 to 88.73 million hectares in 2010–2011 and the net irrigated area has also increased more

than threefold during the same period. Despite the drought, it became a regular and frequent phenomenon in different parts of the country and affected a large number of people during the post-Independence era.<sup>23</sup>

#### *NATIONAL WASTELAND USE INITIATIVES*

National Wasteland Development Board was established in 1985 under the Ministry of Forests and Environment mainly to tackle the problem of degradation of lands, restoration of ecology and to meet the growing demands of fuel wood and fodder at the national level. According to the 1984 estimate, about 1,295.8 lakh hectares were classified as wastelands in India, of which 71.65 lakh hectares (5.53 per cent) were classified as saline and alkaline lands; 736 lakh hectares (56.79 per cent) water eroded areas; 129.26 lakh hectares (9.98 per cent) wind eroded area; and 358.89 lakh hectares (27.69 per cent) forest degraded area (Table 2.3). Nearly 80 per cent of the wasteland is lying with the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Orissa. Of the 5.53 per cent of the saline and alkaline lands, about 57.04 per cent are lying in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, West Bengal and Rajasthan. Of the water eroded area (57 per cent), about three-fourths of the portion lies in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Of the wind eroded wasteland (9.98 per cent), 82 per cent was lying in Rajasthan and the rest in Haryana and Gujarat. Of the degraded forest area (27.69 per cent), about two-thirds (66.76 per cent) was lying in Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (Table 2.3). For this reason, a large proportion of the wasteland belongs to the water eroded and forest degraded areas which is mostly concentrated in a few states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Orissa and Bihar.

The wastelands have declined since the last two decades of the twentieth century from 6.39 lakh square kilometres to 5.53 lakh square kilometres in 2003 and it further declined to 5.13 lakh square kilometres in 2010 (Table 2.4). Since 1986, the wastelands have been divided into thirteen categories and invariably every category has declined from late 1980s to till the 2010 and later.

The wastelands spread over almost all states and union territories; are, however, concentrated only in a few states. In 2003, 5.53 square kilometres of land was classified as wastelands, of which nearly twothirds of the wastelands were concentrated in six states—Rajasthan (18.36 per cent), Jammu & Kashmir (12.7 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (10.34 per cent), Maharashtra (8.92 per cent), Andhra Pradesh (8.19 per cent) and Uttar Pradesh (5.13 per cent) (Table 2.5). Eleven states have only less than 1 per cent of the wastelands.

Since 2005–2006, the wastelands were classified into twenty-three categories. According to 2005–2006 estimates, the total wasteland area was about 4.72 square kilometres and it has declined to 4.67 square kilometres in 2008–2009. It indicates that the wastelands have been converted into arable land since the last two decades of the twentieth century.24

During the post-Independence period, immensely vast areas were brought under forest and cultivation and land was put into nonagricultural use and the phenomenon has progressively increased. On the other hand, barren and unculturable land, land under miscellaneous tree crops and groves (not included in net area sown) and culturable wasteland have declined. Thus, more and more lands were brought either under cultivation or under various infrastructural facilities during the post-Independence period.

#### *TREND OF LAND-USE PATTERN IN DIFFERENT STATES*

The land-use pattern has changed at the macro level and it varies among different states at different points of time. This section will analyse the trend of reporting area of land utilisation statistics, forests, area not available for cultivation, other culturable land, fallow land, net sown area, total cropped area and area sown more than once in different states during the post-Independence period, particularly after the reorganisation of linguistic states.

After Independence, the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, was a major reform of the boundaries of India's states and territories,
organising them along the linguistic lines. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal were formed as separate states. Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep were formed as union territories. While forming the new states, the territories were also reorganised. After the reorganisation of the states in 1956, several states have been created in India. For instance, Gujarat was made separate state in 1960, so as Nagaland (1963), Haryana (1966), Himachal Pradesh (1971), Manipur (1972), Tripura (1972), Meghalaya (1972), Sikkim (1975), Mizoram (1987), Arunachal Pradesh (1987), Goa (1987), Chhattisgarh (2000), Uttarakhand (2000), Jharkhand (2000) and Telangana (2014).

## **Reporting Area of Land Utilisation Statistics**

In most of the states, the reporting area has increased marginally during the post-Independence period, particularly after the linguistic reorganisation of states in 1956. In some of the states, reporting area has declined due to bifurcation of states. Invariably, in most of the states, reporting area has increased marginally during the post-Independence period. The reporting area has increased in the following states: Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, the eight states in Northeast India and the seven union territories (Table 2.6). The state of Jharkhand was bifurcated from Bihar state, Chhattisgarh was bifurcated from Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand from Uttar Pradesh in 2000. For analytical purpose, these states were included with the erstwhile bifurcated states. Whereas, the reporting area has declined in the states of Goa, Jammu & Kashmir, Orissa and West Bengal during the post-Independence period. At the same time, Bihar, including Jharkhand, has no change in the reporting area during the post-Independence period. However, only in few states, such as Himachal Pradesh, the eight states in Northeast India, Gujarat and the seven union territories, huge area was brought under the reporting area. Though in these states, the proportion of the area brought under the reporting area was high; except for Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat, in all other states of Northeast India and union territories, the actual area that has increased is very negligible.

#### **Forests**

As I have mentioned in the previous section, the forest cover has increased from 14 per cent to 23 per cent during the post-Independence period, despite exploitation of large extent of forest for various development purposes. Invariably, in most of the states, the forest area has increased marginally during the post-Independence period. The forest area has increased in the following states: Andhra

Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh + Uttarakhand, the eight states in Northeast India and the seven union territories (Table 2.7). Only in a few states, the forest area has increased remarkably. For example, in Rajasthan 234 per cent, Gujarat 99 per cent, Orissa 63 per cent, Himachal Pradesh 42 per cent, Uttar Pradesh + Uttarakhand 36 per cent, Goa 19 per cent, the eight states in Northeast India 140 per cent, Tamil Nadu 14 per cent and Karnataka 13 per cent between 1960–1961 and 2010–2011. However, the largest proportion of the forest was declined in Haryana (–60.61 per cent) between 1971 and 2010–2011. In Bihar, Jharkhand and Jammu & Kashmir, nearly onefourth and in Punjab, nearly one-fifth of the forest declined during the post-Independence period. In Maharashtra, forest land declined marginally (-3.6 per cent).

From 1980 onwards till 2016, about 0.89 million hectares was diverted for various development purposes. In other words, during the post-Forest Conservation Act period (1980–2016), on an average, about 0.025 million hectares of forest per year was diverted for various development purposes. Of the diverted forest land (0.89 million hectares), more than one-third, i.e., about 37 per cent, was diverted from Madhya Pradesh + Chhattisgarh, 5–7 per cent from Andhra Pradesh + Telangana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh + Uttarakhand and the eight states in Northeast India (Table 2.8). And in the rest of the states, the percentage of diverted land was about less than 5 per cent. It also clearly indicates that the states where area under forest declined are coincident with the forest area diversion.

## **Area Not Available for Cultivation**

Area not available for cultivation category has changed remarkably in different states during the post-Independence period. On the whole, area not available for cultivation has increased in the following states: Andhra Pradesh + Telangana, Bihar + Jharkhand, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh + Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Whereas, this category has declined in Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh + Uttarakhand and the Northeastern states.

Area not available for cultivation consists of two types of land: land put to non-agricultural uses and barren and unculturable land. The land put under the non-agricultural use has increased in different states of the country whereas barren and unculturable land has declined invariably among the states. The barren and unculturable land have declined due to expansion of cultivation and development of infrastructural facilities during the post-Independence period. The area not available for cultivation has declined in the following states—Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh + Uttarakhand and Northeastern states—due to vast extent of barren and unculturable lands brought under the use than that

of the land put to non-agricultural purposes (Table 2.9). In short, wherever the area not available for cultivation has declined mainly due to barren and unculturable lands brought under either for cultivation or for various development purposes during the post-Independence period.

(*in million hectares*)

# **Other Uncultivated Land (Excluding Fallow Land)**

Under this category, there are three types of land: (a) permanent pastures and other grazing lands, (b) land under miscellaneous tree crops and groves and (c) culturable wasteland. Invariably, the area under these three types of other uncultivated land was small and in most of the states, the area under this category has declined during the post-Independence period.

## **Permanent Pastures and Other Grazing Lands**

The permanent pastures and other grazing lands have declined in most of the states except in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh + Uttarakhand. In some states, permanent pastures and other grazing lands have completely disappeared; for example, in Kerala, about 45 million hectares in this category in 1960–1961 disappeared in the year of 2000– 2001. In several states, such as Andhra Pradesh + Telangana, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh + Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Tamil Nadu, more than half of the area has disappeared since the 1960s. About 97 per cent of the area has disappeared in Punjab alone and about 70 per cent of the area disappeared in Tamil Nadu (Table 2.10). Evidently, permanent pastures and other grazing lands have rapidly declined in most of the states during the post-Independence period.

### **Land under Miscellaneous Tree Crops and Groves**

Invariably, the area under miscellaneous tree crops and groves was very small to an extent and a mixed pattern of trend is visible among different states during the post-Independence period. In some states, area under miscellaneous tree crops and groves has increased and in most of the states, it has declined: for instance, in Bihar + Jharkhand, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, the area has increased. In some states, more or less the area remained the same, like in the case of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh + Telangana. It is to be pointed out that the states which had large extent of these areas showed a decline and the states which had lesser area have seen increased lands. For instance, West Bengal had about 639 million hectares in 1960–1961 and it has declined to 53 million hectares in 2010–2011. In other words, about 92 per cent of the area has declined within five decades. Likewise, Madhya Pradesh + Chhattisgarh had about 331 million hectares and it has declined to 29 million hectares for the same period. States like Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana while had only small extent of these lands in 1960, have increased remarkably in the subsequent decades (Table 2.11).

## **Net Sown Area**

Net sown area has increased in most of the states between the years 1960–1961 and 2010–2011. The states in which the net sown area has increased are: Andhra Pradesh + Telangana, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh + Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh + Uttarakhand. The states in which the net sown area has declined

(*in million hectares*)

are: Bihar + Jharkhand, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and the Northeastern states and the union territories. The net sown area has also declined marginally in Maharashtra. In Punjab, the net sown area has declined because the state was bifurcated into Punjab and Haryana. The net sown area has increased in most of the states, except for a minor fluctuation between the year 1960–1961 and 2010–2011. Since 2000– 2001, the net sown area has declined in most of the states (Table 2.15).

Since 1980–1981, the net sown area has declined in Tamil Nadu mainly due to drought and water conflict between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in sharing the Cauvery water.

#### *CONCLUSION*

Since the colonial intervention, the land-use pattern in the Indian subcontinent has changed remarkably in the non-arable lands. From the second quarter of the nineteenth century, the EIC has established coffee and tea plantations mainly in the highlands which destroyed a large extent of the forest areas. At the same time, till the first half of the nineteenth century, the land-use pattern has not changed much due to the low density of population and lack of infrastructural facilities, invariably, in different parts of the country. In other words, except for the plantations development in the highlands, there was no change in the land-use pattern until the mid-nineteenth century.

Since the mid-nineteenth century, the common property lands were converted into arable lands due to the agricultural expansion along with extension of irrigation facilities in different parts of the country. Though agricultural expansion has occurred, generally the sector suffered due to the frequent droughts and famines in a larger part of the country in different points of time. Since the mid-nineteenth century, development of the railway network for establishing its business network which has destroyed a large extent of the forests not only to lay down the timber plate but also to make coaches, berths and fuelwood from the late nineteenth century to the early twentieth century till the replacement of wood by coal for fuel. Since the last quarter of the nineteenth century, more and more areas were brought under the reserve forest. At the same time, the forest resources have been exploited for the commercial motives at the cost of the tribals and other forest-dwelling communities' livelihood options. Consequently, several tribal revolts took place in different parts of the country during the entire colonial period.

During the post-Independence period, the pressure on the landuse pattern has increased due to the rapid population growth, infrastructural development and to increased cultivation. During the early phase of post-Independence period, common property resources were increasingly brought under the utilisation. For example, 1.5 lakh hectares of forest land per annum was diverted for various development activities by the state governments during the first three decades. At the same time, several lakh hectares of land was utilised for non-agricultural purposes and increasing the area under cultivation which took place at the cost of other common property resources.

Since 1985, the Government of India established National Land Use and Conservation Board (NLUCB) to frame land-use policies and to lay emphasis upon planning for optimum utilisation of land resources. This policy focused mainly on the common properties other than the forest land. Indeed, prior to this, different state have established

land-use board in 1975 itself. Consequently, the permanent pastures and other grazing lands, land under miscellaneous tree crops and groves and cultural wastelands have declined or disappeared in different parts of the country.

The post-Independence government has initiated several measures to increase the agricultural production to eradicate the growing poverty. Consequently, agricultural expansion took place and also development of various infrastructural facilities during the early independence period. The agricultural revolution, i.e., green revolution, has brought more area under cultivation.

Since the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1985–1990), the government policies towards the housing projects further paved the way to usher in changes in the land-use pattern. In addition, the globalisation process also has paved the way to acquire the land by the multinational corporations which has been contested by the people. All these initiatives not only changed the land-use pattern but also impacted on environment. The land-use pattern has changed drastically after the constitutional amendment in 1984 and had further accentuated due to the rise of globalisation since the 1990s. However, after the 2013 enactment, some rational have been made to the land-use pattern in the country.

During the post-Independence period, vast expanses of land were brought under net sown area while the fallow land has increased due to droughts and lack of irrigation facilities. Consequently, the proportion of the fallow land has increased and net sown area has declined. Precisely, common property lands have been increasingly brought either under cultivation or for development purposes, while the fallow land has increased due to lack of water, rainfall and other natural calamities occurring in different parts of the country during the post-Independence period.
