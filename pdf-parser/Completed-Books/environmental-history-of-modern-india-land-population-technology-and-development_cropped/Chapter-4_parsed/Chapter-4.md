## COLONIALISM AND THE ECOLOGY1

The ecological and environmental history studies that have emerged during the last quarter of the twentieth century have predominantly focused on forestry and wildlife. These studies by and large are confined to presidency level or specific region level or that of a particular timeframe.<sup>2</sup> These studies focus predominantly on either conservation of forests or commercialisation of forests and its impact on the tribals and other forest-dwelling communities' livelihood. The former one is predominantly focusing on these subjects until the introduction of Indian Forest Act in 1878. It argues that the introduction of the reserve forest is a landmark for the ecological and environmental protection in the Indian subcontinent. The later one has dealt mainly with how the tribals and other forest-dwelling communities were affected due to the enactment of the Indian Forest Act. However, some studies have also explored the ways and means by which the forest resources were systematically exploited for commercial purposes since the late eighteenth to mid-twentieth centuries of the colonial period.3 Of course, these studies also remained confined mostly to the presidency level/regional level and to a particular timeframe. Given the background, this chapter attempts to analyse the ecological and environmental history of India during the colonial era for about one and a half centuries comprising the timeframe, from the late eighteenth to mid-twentieth centuries.

The main focus of this chapter is on analysing the colonial forest policies and that impact on the ecology and environment in the Indian subcontinent during the colonial era, from the late eighteenth century to mid-twentieth century, i.e., in a historical perspective (1800–1947). It raises some important questions, whether the colonial policies were designed to protect the ecology and environment or to exploit the natural resources in general and forest resources in particular. Whether the policy initiatives and enactment of the various acts has really protected the natural resources or were actually designed to extract the natural resources in a much more systematic manner leading to a serious impact on the ecology and environment in the different parts of the county at different points of time over the one and a half of centuries of colonial era. In this chapter, attempt has been made to ascertain the colonial policies and their impact on the ecology and environment of the Indian subcontinent during the colonial rule. This chapter consists of six sections. The second section analyses the colonial approach and its consequences on the ecology and environment till the last quarter of the nineteenth century or prior to the enactment of Indian Forest Act of 1878. The third section deals with various policy initiatives undertaken by the colonial government to protect the natural resources. The fourth section analyses the effects of introduction of protective measures, i.e., as to how the commercialisation of the natural resources has taken place beginning from the last quarter of the nineteenth century to that of the mid-twentieth centuries and the last section offer the concluding observations.

## *COMMERCIALISATION OF FOREST RESOURCES (1800–1878)*

It is a well-known fact that European expeditions to explore new geographical terrains which began from the ninth century and continued till the nineteenth century, primarily were a hunt for resources.<sup>4</sup> In the early period, trade and commerce were their main agenda and later they have started controlling the geographical regions. From the early sixteenth century to the late eighteenth century, they have mainly focused on trade and commerce.<sup>5</sup> Later, they have started controlling the geographical regions and natural resources in different parts of Indian subcontinent. At the close of the eighteenth century, the colonial policy was mainly framed to focus on the expansion of agriculture and to extract timber for different construction purposes. In fact, after the land revenue, the colonial administration gave a high priority to exploit the teak and timber in the early phases of colonial regime. 'The general policy was to expand agriculture and to obtain teak and other timber for the Navy and for construction purposes.<sup>'6</sup> Since the early colonial rule, '... destruction of the more accessible forests increased during the early days of British occupation.'7 Initially, the commercialisation was confined only to specific trees like teak and sandalwood but it later on extended to all forest resources.8 Until the first half of the nineteenth century, forest resources were exploited mainly from the southern peninsula, particularly from the Western Ghats. In the other regions, such as Central Provinces, Bengal and Assam, the colonial administration has not exploited, indeed, they had only a little information.<sup>9</sup> Since the early nineteenth century, the colonial administration extracted the various forest resources for commercial purposes. They have made an attempt to have monopoly control over the forest resources in different parts of the country, and exploited the different kinds of forest resources, such as teak timber for King's Navy, other timbers for export, sandalwood, gums, lac, etc., to supply for iron-

making and sugar-boiling industries, besides destroying the huge extent of forest areas for the cultivation of coffee and tea plantations in the highlands of different regions of the Indian subcontinent.

## **Monopoly Control over Forest Resources**

From the early nineteenth century, the colonial administration established a monopoly control over certain forest resources, particularly in the southern parts of the Western Ghats. In 1807, Captain Watson was appointed as the first Conservator of Forest in India and he exerted control over valuable forest resources of Malabar and Travancore regions within two years. In fact, this position was created by the colonial administration mainly to access the forest resources for future extraction.10 All the claims of the local people and rulers were extinguished by the colonial administration since the early nineteenth century. The colonial government established monopoly control over forest resources from the early nineteenth century. Initially, monopoly control over teak trees was established in Malabar and Travancore regions in the early nineteenth century. Subsequently, it extended to over several other species that had commercial value. 'Between 1820 and 1865, rosewood, *anjili*, ebony and sandalwood were added to the list of species reserved for extraction and use by the colonial government.<sup>11</sup> Huge amount of forest resources were exported from different parts of the country. For instance, in 1877–1878, the export of forest resources worth of £1,041,726, of which £406,652 was from teak, £362,008 from lac and lac-dye, £89,381 from caoutchouc and £183,685 from gums.<sup>12</sup> Since the early nineteenth century, the colonial administration had exercised control over the forest resources for their commercial venture*.*

# **Teak Timber for King's Navy**

The natural resources of England, particularly oak trees, immensely helped in ship-building since the early period. 'The universally high regard felt by Englishmen for their native oak as the choicest of ship timbers led them to depend upon their own woodlands for a constant supply with which to build hulls for the King's ships.'13 They did not encounter any scarcity for oak trees until the mid-seventeenth century. 'Prior to the beginning of the First Dutch War, in 1652, there was no real naval timber problem, for the naval fighting was carried on for the most part by private ships gathered for the occasion'.14 Since the mid-seventeenth century, timber scarcity was felt in England; however, they have managed without any major difficulties. 'Just before the Second Dutch War, the American Revolution, and the war with Revolutionary France, investigators reported almost complete exhaustion of the native oak supply, yet the Navy sustained all those contests without

suffering the extreme consequences predicted in such black colors.<sup>15</sup> In the subsequent centuries, timber scarcity was aggravated in England due to frequent wars. 'The timber problem was first realized in the sixteenth century. It became acute during the Restoration. A century later, after the Seven Years' War, the scarcity of oak caused very general alarm, and during the remaining hundred years of wooden shipbuilding the groves of England became less and less capable of meeting the increasing demands of the Navy.'16 'During the first half of the eighteenth century, the timber problem was dormant in the English forests.<sup>'17</sup> 'The Seven Years' War from 1756 to 1763 brought the timber shortage back to where it had been just a century before.'18 Since the mid-eighteenth century, England started looking for the timber resources from other countries, particularly colonies. 'The most successful attempt to relieve the timber shortage by foreign shipbuilding came from the use of teak in India.'19 'England armed dozens of ships built in India for her expeditions against Ceylon, Java, Manila, and the Moluccas, and into the Red Sea, between 1795 and 1800.'20 Albion states:

The choicest timber lay in the southwestern part of India, in the region known as the Malabar Coast, but even in India a shortage of good naval timber was already felt. Tippoo Sahib, who had controlled a large portion of that country, had cut off much of the largest teak in the interests of the French. The shipbuilding of the Portuguese was a constant drain on the supply of ship timber.<sup>21</sup>

Prior to the British invasion in southern parts of the Indian peninsula, other European countries extracted the timber to build ships.

At the close of the eighteenth century, there was a scarcity for oak timber in England to build ships. This had compelled them to find an alternative source of supply from other countries, mainly from its colonies.22 They found that appropriate teak timber was found in abundance in India, particularly in southern parts of the country. The growing demand for teak timber was one of the matters which received the early attention of the East India Company. Initially,

… an order issued by the Bengal–Bombay Joint Commission, appointed to enquire into the internal circumstances of Malabar and make regulations prohibiting the felling of Teak below 21 inches in girth. Nothing further happened till 1805, when a dispatch was received from the Court of Directors, enquiring to what extent the King's Navy might, in view of the growing deficiency of Oak in England, depended on a permanent supply of Teak timber from Malabar.… The immediate result was a general proclamation, declaring the royalty right in Teak trees claimed by the former Governments was vested in the Company, and prohibiting all further unauthorized felling on such trees.… Thus, Captain Watson of the Police was on the 10<sup>th</sup> November 1806 appointed the first Conservator of Forests in India.23

Within a couple of years he had succeeded in establishing a timber monopoly throughout Malabar–Travancore, and practically annihilated more or less all private rights in the forests by assuming their nonexistence.24 Large quantities of teak timber were extracted to build the British Navy till 1822.<sup>25</sup> These measures were contested both by the proprietors and merchants that has led to the abolition of Conservator of Forest post itself in 1823.<sup>26</sup> To ensure the future teak supply, Nilambur teak plantation was established in 1842. In short, the early colonial rule has extracted the forest resources mainly to meet the demand from their own country. Any attempt to protect the forest was not really to conserve it but to ensure the future supply, particularly to meet the demand in England.

## **Timber Export**

Since the beginning of the colonial rule, a large number of the timbers were cut down for the various commercial purpose in different parts of the Indian subcontinent. A large quantity of timber and wood has been exported to the European countries. For instance, about £7,093,957 worth of timber and wood was exported between 1849 and 1878 (Table 4.1). It is to be pointed out that the timber export has progressively increased every year during the third quarter of the nineteenth century. In fact, the extraction of timber and wood for export had progressively increased from the early nineteenth century.

### **Extraction of Sandalwood**

Since the early nineteenth century, a large quantity of sandalwood from the hills/forest was extracted mainly to export to other countries for commercial motives.27 In fact, the colonial government has encouraged the middlemen to export the sandalwood by providing the required facilities. A large quantity of sandalwood was extracted from the different districts of the Madras Presidency since the late eighteenth century. For example, about 62,984–11¾ *mounds*28 of sandalwood was delivered from Coimbatore district alone to the Board of Trade between 1799 and 1809 and it was worth of 104,915 *Star Pagodas*29 nine *fanams*30 eight *cash*31. After the colonial intervention, these sandalwood trees were extracted for commercial purposes and even exported to other countries like China. For instance, in Salem district alone, revenue from sandalwood was about 3,776-30-40 *Star Pagodas* in 1800-1801.<sup>32</sup> The collector had reported that about 200-400 *candies*<sup>33</sup>of sandalwood could be supplied from the district annually.<sup>34</sup> Later, the right to cut sandalwood was leased out to private contractors. Around 1836, the government engaged itself to ascertain the number of sandalwood trees in different hills and it came out that the precious trees were in plenty in different hills of Salem district.<sup>35</sup> Subsequently, through lease/rent of sandalwood cutting rights in different hills, the colonial government earned a large amount of revenue. For instance, in a decade between 1862–1863 and 1875–1876, about  $\bar{\mathfrak{X}}$ 147,537 was earned from the sandalwood.<sup>36</sup> In other words, about one-fourth of total receipts of the Forest Department had come from sandalwood in Salem and Baramahal regions.

### **Gums and Resins**

Gums and resins were another example of important forest resource that were exported to other countries from the early colonial period. Between 1849 and 1878, about £2,745,616 worth of gums and resins were exported to other countries (Table 4.2). The export value of gums and resins has progressively increased till the last quarter of the nineteenth century.

#### **Lac**

Like other forest goods, the colonial administration has extracted a huge amount of lac from the forests and exports it to other countries. Between 1849 and 1878, about £6,365,475 worth of lac was being exported to other countries (Table 4.3). The lac exports have been increasing every year from the second half of the nineteenth century, up to the enactment of the Indian Forest Act of 1878.

### **Coffee and Tea Plantations**

### *Coffee*

Coffee plantations were established during the early nineteenth century in different parts of the country. However, coffee plantations were largely confined to peninsular India, particularly in the Western Ghats, from Kanara to Travancore. In the early period, the coffee plantations were concentrated in Coorg, two districts—Kadur and Hassan—in Mysore State, the Nilgiris in Madras Presidency and Waynad in Kerala. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the coffee plantations were established in Shervaroy hills in Salem district and Palni hills in Madurai

(*in £*)

district of Madras Presidency.<sup>37</sup> Attempts had been made in the other parts of the country, particularly in British Burma and Chittagong in Bengal Presidency, which however had not materialised.<sup>38</sup>

Coffee plantations were established in various hills of South India during the early nineteenth century, particularly between 1830s and 1850s. However, these plantations progress was very slow till the 1860s.39 Coffee plantations were largely found in the highlands of the different regions of South India: two districts of Mysore State—Hassan and Kadur; few districts of Madras Presidency—Madurai, Tinnevelly, Coimbatore, the Nilgiris, Salem and Malabar; and Princely States—Coorg, Cochin and Tiruvancore.40 As of 1883, 335,308.5 acres of land were brought under the coffee cultivation.<sup>41</sup> The colonial government has encouraged coffee and tea cultivation by providing various forms of subsidies and concessions.42 However, it has to be pointed out that the planters had not received much support from the Princely States of Mysore and Coorg.<sup>43</sup>

A large extent of coffee products was exported to other countries and the quantity of exports has progressively increased almost every year since the mid-nineteenth century. For instance, 327.32 thousand metric tons of coffee was exported between 1852 and 1878 (Table 4.4). Export of coffee has increased gradually in the first decade of the late nineteenth century (1850–1860) and the subsequent two decades (1860–1878) exports were very high. This trend could be attributed to the prices of coffee at the global market. The price of coffee has increased fairly until 1880s.<sup>44</sup> Coffee was exported predominantly to the United Kingdom and France, besides Austria, Turkey, Egypt, the United States of America, Arabia, Ceylon, Persia, Victoria and foreign ports in India and other ports of the Indian subcontinent.45 A large quantity of coffee being exported mainly was to the European countries and the United States of America during the late nineteenth century. The export value has progressively increased from £75,723 in 1849 to £1,344,038 in 1878 (Table 4.4). In other words, about £18,445,056 worth of coffee was exported during the span of three decades (1849–1878).

#### *Tea Plantations*

From the early period, tea plants were found in our country particularly in the southern valley of Himalayas, but it did not get much attention from the people until the second quarter of the nineteenth century. Tea plantation initiatives have started during the second quarter of the nineteenth century. In 1834, under Governor-General Lord William Bentinck, a committee was appointed 'for the purpose of submitting a plan for the introduction of tea-culture into India'.47 In the subsequent years, plants and seeds were brought from China and distributed all over the country. In addition to that, the government itself formed experimental plantations in Upper Assam and Kumaun and Garwal districts of Northwestern Provinces.<sup>48</sup> In 1839, the Assam Tea Company was formed for which the government provided the land.49 In Kumaun, some retired government officers came forward to the aid establishment of the tree plantations. However, no notable progress had taken place until the second half of the nineteenth century. Since the second quarter of the nineteenth century; gradually, tea plantations were extended to other regions of Assam that was supported by the promulgation of the Waste-Land Rules of 1854. Around 1856, tea plantation was introduced in Darjeeling and Sikkim regions.

Unlike the coffee plantation, tea plantation was found in different parts of the country. In 1882–1883, about 870,316 acres of land was brought under the tea plantation, of which, 756,707 acres (87 per cent) were in Assam; 94,184 acres (11 per cent) were in Bengal and the rest in Punjab, Madras and Travancore regions.<sup>50</sup> Precisely, the tea plantations were largely located both in Assam and Bengal regions of the Indian subcontinent.

Like coffee, tea was also exported to other countries as early as in the second half of the nineteenth century. For instance, from the Madras Presidency alone about 2,172,999 pounds quantity worth of  $\bar{\xi}$  2,374,910 was exported between 1855–1856 and 1882–1883.<sup>51</sup> In 1867–1868, 7,811,429 pounds of tea were exported and it has increased to 17,920,439 pounds in 1872–1873.52 In 1877–1878, the

total export of tea from British India was about 33,656,715 pounds worth of £3,061,867 (Table 4.5).

In the subsequent years, it has increased further. In 1882–1883, about 58,233,345 pounds worth £3,738,842. In addition to this, from Madras Presidency, 309,548 pounds worth of £32,905 was exported.<sup>53</sup> It clearly shows that the colonial administration has encouraged the establishment the plantations in different regions of the country, particularly in the hill areas mainly for export to the other countries and in the process destroyed a large extent of forests during the early nineteenth century.<sup>54</sup> From the early nineteenth century onwards, the colonial government has encouraged the plantations by providing concessions in different parts of the country that has resulted in denudation of the forests and other natural resources since the early nineteenth century.

#### **Iron-Making and Sugar-Boiling Industries**

As we have mentioned earlier, iron deposits are extensively found in the hills in different parts of the country. In South India, 'Salem, the Northern Circars, ceded Districts, and Mysore, iron is found largely in ore, while in Coimbatore and Malabar the black sand brought down by streams was rich in the metal.'55 Until the colonial intervention, the traditional iron-making industries supplied agricultural implements, carpenters' and smiths' tools, and iron-boilers for sugar-making, domestic utensils and to meet many other requirements of the people.56 These industries have employed workers varying from three to ten and in some cases the numbers may even go up to twenty.57 Even in other parts of the country, only a small number of workers
were involved in the production process. '[I]ron in India is manufactured only by peasant families of smelters, each working on a small scale.'58 These traditional iron-making industries, though spread over different parts of the country, mostly depended on the locally available fuelwood for burning charcoal mainly from their own villages.

Since the early nineteenth century, the colonial government emphasised upon the extraction of iron ore but it was confined only to South India. In 1824, Thomas Munro observed that '… the richness of the ores of Salem and other districts have been known above thirty years, without anything having been done to extend their produce, and he suggested that the State has to extend the support for extracting the resources.'59 In 1824, Heath, who was working in Madras Civil Service, requested the government for the exclusive right of iron-making in India and a lease of right of cutting the fuelwood in the government wasteland.<sup>60</sup> In fact, Munro and other members' recommended Heath's proposal with the support of necessary facilities for establishing the iron-making industries. The Court of Directors had, however, declined to accept the proposal.<sup>61</sup> After some years, the Court of Directors gave exclusive privilege to establish the iron-making industries in the Madras Presidency in 1830.<sup>62</sup> He established the iron-making industries at Porto Nova in South Arcot district with the help of the government.

In 1833, Heath applied to the government for further financial assistance as well as other kinds of support. Considering the cost of production when compared with other countries, the government extended its support to this iron-making industry.<sup>63</sup> 'Accordingly in 1833 Heath was granted exclusive mining rights in Salem, Coimbatore, South Arcot, Malabar and Canara and gave permission to cut fuel in Tanjore, Tiruchinopoly and South Arcot with exemption from various duties for 21 years.'64 In addition to this, the duty on Indian iron in England was reduced and the materials required for the Porto Nova were allowed to pass duty free.<sup>65</sup> In 1853, the colonial government has granted permission to the East India Iron Company for the exclusive right of getting ore from government wastelands in South Arcot, Salem, Malabar, Canara and Coimbatore for thirty years on the payment of rent £500 per annum.<sup>66</sup> In addition, to the native iron-smelting industries and British Iron-making Company, the sugar-boiling industries in the different districts of the Madras Presidency consumed a large quantity of fuelwood during the early colonial period.<sup>67</sup>

Later, in 1880s, an attempt has been made to smelt iron ore by using coal in Raniganj, Birbhum and Manbhum districts of Bengal Presidency, Central Provinces and Kumaun in Northwestern Provinces.<sup>68</sup> But these

projects were abandoned due to lack of profit. It clearly indicates that the colonial government has encouraged the iron-making industries by extending all kinds of concessions leading to the decline of forest resources in different parts of the country during the early nineteenth century.

# **Coal Mining**

Though the availability of coal has been known in this country since the late eighteenth century, attempts were not, however, made to extract these resources until the early nineteenth century. The first English coalmine was opened in 1820. And yet, no other industry was established in the subsequent two decades. From 1854 onwards, every year a number of coalmine industries were established. In 1885, about 65 working collieries were developed in the country. The coalmining industries were largely concentrated in the Santal Parganas of Bengal Presidency.69 Few coalmining industries were also found in the Chanda district of Central Provinces and Khasi and Jaintia hills and Lakhimpur district of Assam, Darjeeling and in the Salt Range of Punjab.<sup>70</sup> There were four prominent coalfields in the country: Damodar Valley, Chota Nagpur group, Narmada Valley and Godavari Valley. Predominantly, these coalfields were located in the hill and forest areas leading to large-scale destruction of natural resources in the country.

## **Railways**

Unlike the other interventions, which were confined either to a particular region or presidency, the establishment of railway network has, however, destroyed the forest resources invariably in different parts of the country. The first idea of railroads in India was conceived in 1831–1832 in the Presidency of Madras.71 However, only 'in May 1845 the Court of Directors of the East India Company gave their formal recognition to the desirability of railways in India and called the attention of the Governor General in India.'72 'In July 1847, the Court of Directors represented the desirability of permitting the construction of short experimental lines not only in Bengal, but in Bombay and Madras as well.'73 It is interesting to note that the establishment of the railway network was not meant for the common people of the country but to the extent as a market for British goods and investment. It is more appropriate to quote Guha: 'In a famous minute of 1853, the governor general of India, Lord Dalhousie, wrote of how railway construction was both the means for creating a market for British goods and the outlet for British capital seeking profitable avenues for investment.'74 In other words: 'For the most

part, however, from the beginning of the railways in South Asia, the majority of the benefits accrued to Great Britain.'75 Thus, in effect, 'commodification, in the form of looking at all nature as having value only in its profit-making potential, became official economic policy.'76

The first railway line in India, extending over a distance of 21 miles from Bombay to Thana, was opened for public traffic on 16 April 1853. The first section of the East Indian Railway from Howrah to Hoogly, a distance of 23 miles, was opened on 15 August 1854. The Madras Railway Company opened its first section, 65 miles long, from Rayapuram to Arcot, in 1856.77 By 1867 the all-rail route between Calcutta and Delhi and also between Calcutta and Bombay was completed.78 Since the introduction of railways in 1853, the length of railway track has phenomenally increased. In 1854, 35 miles of railway network was opened for the traffic and it has increased to 6,029 miles in 1877.<sup>79</sup> Stebbing stated:

The new line to be constructed was the Indus Valley Railway between Multan and Sukkur, a distance of nearly 300 miles. At the rate of 2,000 sleepers per mile this would require 600,000 sleepers 10 feet by 10 inches by 5 inches (or 3.5 cubic feet apiece), being upwards of 2,000,000 cubic feet. The locomotives would use fuel-wood. At the rate of one train daily either way and at one *maund* per train-mile an annual supply of 219,000 *maunds* would be demanded. In addition, a large supply of fuel for brick-burning would be required. The sleepers would have to come mainly from the Sind Forests. The fuels were to come from the Tamarisk and Jhand forests of Sind and the Punjab. The other new line was the Northern State Railway from Lahore to Multan. It was estimated that 2,200,000 sleepers would be required for its construction.<sup>80</sup>

For every mile of track laid, 860 sleepers were required, which had an expected lifespan of approximately twelve to fourteen years. In the 1870s, it was calculated that every year one million sleepers were needed. Indian trees, particularly sal (*Shorea robusta*), deodar (*Cedrus deodara*) and teak (*Tectona grandis*) were preferred as sleepers, for their perceived strength over other Indian timbers, so it was these three species that were intensively exploited.

A large quantity of forest resources was extracted due to the establishment of railways in the Madras Presidency during the latter part of the nineteenth century.<sup>81</sup> For example, in 1878, the agent of the Madras Railways stated that the approximate requirement of wood for fuel was about 91,000 tons.<sup>82</sup> Due to the laying of Madras Railways, a large number of valuable trees were cut down in the forest areas of different parts of South India. For example, in 1859–1860

about 245,743 berths were supplied from Salem and Baramahal region alone.<sup>83</sup> In addition to the berths, a large quantity of wood was purchased for the fuel by the Madras Railways. About 354,921 tons of wood was purchased and about 801,504,650 pounds or 357,017.66 tons of wood was consumed, exclusive of small wood for lightings during the period of five years, 1873-1877.84 In short, large quantities of forest resources were extracted for the railways in different parts of the country during the third quarter of the nineteenth century.85

## **War of Independence**

After the First War of Indian Independence in 1857, tremendous demand for the timber has led to the destruction of forests for the following purposes: expansion of railway network, demand for the British Navy and the excessive commercial exploitation of timber was done to pay for the cost of suppressing the War of Independence.<sup>86</sup>

### **Revenue from the Forest**

Since the early nineteenth century, the Forest Department has extracted a sizeable amount of revenue from the forests, either through selling of forest resources directly or leasing out the rights of collection of forest produce in different parts of the country. However, there is no evidence of a separate account for it during the early nineteenth century. But the available data clearly indicates that the revenue from the forest was not a negligible amount. In 1868, about £331,088 worth of revenue was collected from the forest resources. In the subsequent years, the revenue from the forest has increased progressively. Between 1868 and 1877, about £5,213,350 was collected from the forests in India (Table 4.6). This may be attribute

| Year | Revenue (in $\pounds$ ) |

to commercialisation of forest resources prior to the conservation initiatives. In other words, since the early nineteenth century, different kinds of forest resources were extracted for commercial purpose that has led to detrimental ecological and environmental impact on the Indian subcontinent.

## *CONSERVATION INITIATIVES: FOREST AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ACTS*

This consists of two parts; one is the forest related initiatives and the part two other environmental protection measures.

#### **Forest-related Policies and Acts**

According to Grove, the consequences of deforestation on the ecology and environment were realised by the colonial administration during the second quarter of the nineteenth century both in the Bombay and Madras Presidencies. However, constructive initiatives were made only during the second half of the nineteenth century. The office of Conservator of Forest position was introduced in different presidencies. 'In 1847, Bombay Presidency appointed Dr. Gibson as a regular Conservator of Forests. Madras followed suit some years later and in 1865 appointed Dr. Cleghorn as Conservator of Forests in Madras Presidency.<sup>87</sup> At the country level, conservation was emphasised only during the late nineteenth century. In 1855, Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General, issued the 'Charter of the Indian Forests' outlining forest conservancy for whole of India.<sup>88</sup>

Since the late eighteenth century, colonial administration imposed several restrictions on the forest-dwellers and other people to use the forest resources; however, by and large these restrictions were confined to only particular regions/hills. Indeed, large extents of the forest were alienated/denuded for the tea and coffee plantations in different hill regions of the country since the second quarter of the nineteenth century. Sandalwood extraction was controlled by the colonial administration, particularly in the peninsular region from the early nineteenth century. Teak timber extraction was taken over by the colonial administration from the early nineteenth century itself. However, no specific act was in force to protect the natural resources of the country as a whole, until the introduction of the Indian Forest Act in 1865.

#### *Indian Forest Act, 1865*

The Indian Forest Act, 1865, empowered the government to declare any land covered with trees as government forest and bring it under the government management. The main aim of this act was to ensure sustenance for the future needs of the nation and states. Another unfortunate aspect of this act was that it did not emphasise on the environment and ecology points of view but aimed to preserve for the future requirements of forest resources. However, this act was confined only to the government forests and it did not cover private forests. The revenue department has played a more prominent role than that of the forest department to determine the reserve forest areas. While the interests of the agricultural communities gained greater importance than that of reserve forests.

#### *Indian Forest Act, 1878*

The Indian Forest Act, 1878, was a landmark not only in the Indian forest history but also from the ecology and environmental point of view. This act was extended to all the provinces of British India except Madras, Coorg, Burma, Bihar, the Hissar district of Punjab, Ajmer and Baluchistan. It is a comprehensive one not only in terms of outlining the procedures for the reserve forest but also imposed restrictions on the people's rights over the forest land. Under this act, forests were divided into three categories: reserved forests, protected forests and village forests. At the same time, it has to be pointed out that though the government has brought out large tracts of forest areas under reserve forest and imposed several restrictions on the forest resources using communities, resulting in more systematic extraction.

The Indian Forest Act, 1878, under Section 23 prohibited the following: Any person who (a) makes any fresh clearing prohibited by Section 5, or (b) sets fire to a reserved forest, or, in contravention of any rules made by the State Government on this behalf, kindles any fire, or leaves any fire burning, in such manner as to endanger such a forest; or who, in a reserved forest (c) kindles, keeps or carries any fire except at such seasons as the forest-officer may notify in this behalf; (d) trespasses or pastures cattle, or permits cattle to trespass; (e) causes any damage by negligence in felling any tree or cutting or dragging any timber; (f) fells, girdles, lops, or bums any tree or strips off the bark or leaves from, or otherwise damages, the same; (g) quarries stone, bums lime or charcoal, or collects, subjects to any manufacturing process, or removes, any forest-produce; (h) clears or breaks up any land for cultivation or any other purpose; (i) in contravention of any rules made in this behalf by the State Government hunts, shoots, fishes, poisons water or sets traps or

snares; or (j) in any area in which the Elephants' Preservation Act, 1879, (6 of 1879), is not in force, kills or catches elephants in contravention of any rules so made, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both, in addition to such compensation for damage done to the forest as the convicting court may direct to be paid.

### *Indian Forest Act, 1927*

The Indian Forest Act, 1927, was extensively modified form of the Forest Act of 1878 and continued to be in force until the end of colonial era. Basically, this act has brought several other forest resources under the forest produce and imposed further restrictions of the people. Under Section 26(1), it prohibited in the following: Any person who (a) makes any fresh clearing prohibited by Section 5, or (b) sets fire to a reserved forest, or, in contravention of any rules made by the State Government in this behalf, kindles any fire, or leaves any fire burning, in such manner as to endanger such a forest; or who, in a reserved forest (c) kindles, keeps or carries any fire except at such seasons as the forest-officer may notify in this behalf; (d) trespasses or pastures cattle, or permits cattle to trespass; (e) causes any damage by negligence in felling any tree or cutting or dragging any timber; (f) fells, girdles, lops, or bums any tree or strips off the bark or leaves from, or otherwise damages, the same; (g) quarries stone, bums lime or charcoal, or collects, subjects to any manufacturing process, or removes, any forestproduce; (h) clears or breaks up any land for cultivation or any other purpose; (i) in contravention of any rules made in this behalf by the State Government hunts, shoots, fishes, poisons water or sets traps or snares; or (j) in any area in which the Elephants' Preservation Act, 1879 (6 of 1879), is not in force, kills or catches elephants in contravention of any rules so made, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both, in addition to such compensation for damage done to the forest as the convicting court may direct to be paid. To be precise, this forest acts helps to bring out more forest area under the reserve forest. It had also extensively curtailed the people's rights during the colonial period. However, some provinces like Burma and Madras enacted separate forest acts.

### **Other Environmental Protection Measures, till 1947**

Till the mid-nineteenth century, the colonial government did not launch any initiatives to protect the environment. Even the environmental protection measures were mainly regulative in nature and were limited

only to protect water and air pollution, and that too was largely in the urban areas and towns. In addition to the forest acts, other acts were also enacted at the presidency level to regulate the water and air pollution. However, these acts were largely confined to cities/towns and companies during the colonial period. Several acts were enacted, such as The Shore Nuisances (Bombay and Kolaba) Act, 1853; The Oriental Gas Company Act, 1857; The Indian Penal Code, 1860; Indian Forest Acts, 1878; The Indian Easements Act of 1882; Indian Fisheries Act of 1897; The Bengal Smoke Nuisance Act, 1905; The Bombay Smoke Nuisance Act, 1912, etc., which are only explained here.

### *The Shore Nuisances (Bombay and Kolaba) Act, 1853*

This act empowered the authorities to remove any kind of inconvenience, obstruction or encroachment in the Bombay harbour and Kolaba seashores. According to this act, the authorities were given the power to check or evacuate 'any nuisance, obstruction or encroachment anywhere below high-water mark in the said harbour of Bombay, or upon or about the shores of the said islands.' Though this act was enacted to protect the seashores but essentially was confined to the Bombay harbour and Kolaba regions to prevent disturbances of any sort in the harbour and the various related activities.

### *The Oriental Gas Company Act, 1857*

The Oriental Gas Company was established in Calcutta under the Oriental Gas Company Act, 1857, to distribute the coal gas for lighting from its plants at Rajabazar and Howrah. Under this act, any damages to the water bodies, both common and private, will be an offence. According to the Oriental Gas Company Act, 1857, contamination to the water bodies will be a punishable offence under Section 15. It says that:

Daily penalty during the continuance of the offence. If the said Company shall at any time cause or suffer to be brought, or to flow into any stream, reservoir, aqueduct, pond, or place for water, or into any drain communicating therewith, any washing or other substance produced in making or supplying Gas, or shall willfully do any act connected with the making or supplying of Gas, whereby the water in any such stream, reservoir, aqueduct, pond, on place for water, shall be fouled, the said Company shall forfeit for every such offence a sum not exceeding one thousand rupees; and they shall forfeit an additional sum not exceeding five hundred rupees for each day during which such washing or other substance shall be brought or shall flow, or the act by which such water shall be

found shall continue, after the expiration of twenty-four hours from the time when notice of the offence shall have been served on the said Company, by the person into whose water such washing or other substance shall be brought or shall flow, or whose water shall be fouled thereby; and such penalties shall be paid to such last-mentioned person.<sup>89</sup>

Further, it also made provisions for penalty if they company fouled the individual water resources. Under Section 17, 'Whenever any water shall be fouled by the Gas of the said Company, they shall forfeit to the person whose water shall be so fouled for every such offence a sum not exceeding two hundred rupees, and a further sum, not exceeding one hundred rupees, for each day during which the offence shall continue, after the expiration of twenty-four hours from the service of notice of such offence.'

## *The Indian Penal Code, 1860*

The Indian Penal Code, 1860, made certain provinces to protect the people from water and air pollution, which affects the public health. It was the first attempt to protect the water and air from the environmental point of view. Certain provisions were made to protect water and air from pollution and pronounced such activities as an offence. According to Section 277:

Whoever voluntarily corrupts or fouls the water of any public spring or reservoir, so as to render it less fit for the purpose for which it is ordinarily used, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.<sup>90</sup>

Section 278 proclaims that, 'whoever voluntarily vitiates the atmosphere in any place so as to make it noxious to the health of persons is general dwelling or carrying on business in the neighbourhood or passing along a public way, shall be punished with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees.'91

### *The Indian Easements Act of 1882*

The Indian Easements Act of 1882, Section 23, prohibits polluting the stream against the lower riparian owners by the upstream owners.

### *Indian Fisheries Act of 1897*

Destruction of fish by explosives and poisoning waters was prohibited by the Indian Fisheries Act, 1897. According to Sections 4 and 5: If any person put any dynamite or other explosive substance or any poison,

lime or noxious material in any water to catch or destroy the fish, he shall be punishable with imprisonment of term which may extend to two months, or with fine of 200 rupees.

#### *The Bengal Smoke Nuisance Act, 1905*

The Bengal Smoke Nuisance Act, 1905, was enacted to prevent or reduce atmospheric pollution due to the nuisances arising from the smoke of furnaces, fire-places in the town and suburbs of Calcutta and in Howrah.

#### *The Bombay Smoke Nuisance Act, 1912*

The Bombay Smoke Nuisance Act, 1912, was enacted to prevent or reduce atmospheric pollution due the nuisance arising from the smoke of furnaces in the town and Islands of Bombay.

Until the colonial intervention, only specific forest resources were controlled by the rulers in different parts of the country and all other resources were used by the people without any restrictions. After the colonial intervention, control over the forest resources were extended to some more forest resources, particularly teak, sandalwood in different parts of the country. Indeed, these resources were not only controlled but were also extracted for commercial purposes. Introduction of the commercial crops in different hills destroyed the forests beginning from the early nineteenth century. However, no forest act was enacted until 1865. Interestingly, the subsequent forest acts have also helped to bring out more forest area under the reserve forest area and also extensively curtailed the people's rights. In addition to the forest acts, other environmental protection acts were also enacted at the presidency level to regulate the water and air pollution. However, these acts were largely confined to cities/towns and companies during the colonial period. To conclude, while restricting the people to use the forest resources, the colonial policy continued to be a guide for the commercialisation of the forest resources until the mid-twentieth century.

### *CONSERVATION AND COMMERCIALISATION OF FORESTS*

Commercialisation of forests has continued to be the primary agenda of colonial administration despite several conservation initiatives being taken during the last quarter of the nineteenth century.<sup>92</sup> In other words, '… the ultimate goal of the Forestry Service was to maximize the profit from timber and other forest commodities (e.g., resins) as
much as possible.'93 Until the first half of the nineteenth century, the forest resources were exploited mainly from South India, particularly the Western Ghats. In the other regions, such as the Central Provinces, Bengal and Assam, the colonial administration did not exploit as they had only little information.<sup>94</sup> During the second half of the nineteenth century, forest resources were exploited invariably in different regions of the Indian subcontinent. In the Central Provinces, forest resources were extracted by the timber contractors, particularly in the second half of the nineteenth century.<sup>95</sup> In the Western Himalayas also, forest were extensively cut down for the use of railways during the same period. Let us see how forest resources, such as timber, sandalwood, gums, lac, etc., had been extracted after the conservation initiatives were undertaken by the colonial administration.

### **Timber Export**

As I have indicated earlier, the Indian Forest Act, 1878, had restricted the tribals and other forest-dwelling communities to avail the forest resources. While restricting them, the colonial administration continues

to extract timber and wood from the forest and exported that to the other countries. 'Hardwoods are found in all parts of India, though for export purposes the most important areas are Burma; the Andamans, and the Western Ghats.'96 'Teak, of which over one million pounds worth is imported into the United Kingdom each year, is obtained entirely from the countries of the East India, particularly Burma, is the most important source of supply.'97 Extraction of timber and wood and their export has progressively increased during the post-Forest Act period. For instance, about £24,791,361 from 1879 to 1919 and  $\bar{\tau}$ 112,831,080 from 1920 to 1947 worth of timber and wood was exported between 1879 and 1947 (see Table 4.7). It shows that the forest resources have been to the other countries for commercial purposes from the late nineteenth century onwards.

#### **Extraction of Sandalwood**

A large quantity of sandalwood resources has been extracted during the period of study. Further, it also indicates that the extraction of sandalwood resources has progressively increased from 1882–1883 to 1946–1947 (Table 4.8). About 22,755 tons of sandalwood was extracted over the period of fifty-three years between1882 and 1947 in the Madras

Presidency alone. It clearly indicates that the extraction of forest resources has not declined when the concept of conservation was being introduced as against the extraction of these resources that has shown progressive increase during that period.

# **Export of Sandalwood Oil**

In addition to sandalwood, sandalwood oil is also exported to other countries. During the third decade of twentieth century (1930–1940), about 105,593 gallons<sup>99</sup> worth of ₹11,689 thousand exported to the other countries (Table 4.9). Huge quantity of sandalwood was cut down to extract the sandalwood oil. For example, 'Mature sandalwood trees weigh around 100 kg, of which 20 kg is the aromatic heartwood, which in turn produces between 600–700 ml of oil per tree.<sup>'100</sup> It clearly indicates that a huge quantity of sandalwood was cut down to extract the oil even after the enactment of Indian Forest Act mainly to export to the other countries.

# **Coffee and Tea Plantations**

Even after introduction of the forest act, the colonial government has encouraged coffee and tea cultivation by providing various forms of subsidies and concessions.101 However, it has to be pointed out that the planters have not received much support from the Princely States of Mysore and Coorg.102 In 1885–1886, about 338,253 acres (119,142 acres coffee and 219,111 acres tea) were brought under the cultivation of plantations. In the subsequent decades, the area under plantations has increased progressively until the colonial period. In 1989–1990, about 369,891 acres (118, 219 acres coffee and 251,672 acres tea) were brought under the cultivation. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the area under the plantations was about 6.26 lakh acres (1.33 lakh acres coffee and 4.93 lakh acres tea), and it has increased to 7.97 lakh in 1920 (0.96 lakh acres coffee and 7.01 lakh acres tea), 8.57 lakh in 1930 (0.91 lakh acres coffee and 8.57 lakh acres tea), and 10.07 lakh in 1947 (2.25 lakh acres coffee and 7.82 lakh acres tea (Table 4.12).

The data clearly indicates that the area under plantations has progressively increased during the post-Forest Act period. The overall plantation area continues to grow during the post-Forest Act period, whereas the area under coffee plantations was almost stagnant during the first three decades of the twentieth century and then it gradually increased. The area under tea plantations continues to grow till the fourth decade of the twentieth century and then it begins to decline marginally.

Coffee products were exported on a large scale to other countries and the quantity of exports has progressively increased annually since the late nineteenth century. For instance, 815.17 thousand metric tons of coffee was exported between 1879 and 1947 (Table 4.13). A huge amount of coffee was exported during the post-Forest Act period. Coffee export was very high for a period of the three and half decades, i.e., between 1879 and 1915, and then the next one and a half decades (1915–1930). It was followed by a high rate of fluctuations and the last one and a half decades (1930–1947), these exports have declined remarkably. This trend could be attributed to the growing prices of coffee at the global market. The prices of coffee have increased fairly until 1880s, and then it has slowly declined in the subsequent years. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the coffee prices have reached an all-time low and thereafter the prices have slowly increased.<sup>104</sup> Coffee was exported predominantly to the United Kingdom and France, besides Austria, Turkey, Egypt, the United States of America, Arabia, Ceylone, Pergia, Victoria and foreign ports in India and other ports of the Indian subcontinent.105 The value of the coffee exports has increased remarkably during the post-Forest Act period. Between 1978 and 1941, i.e., nearly seven decades, £75,743,552 worth of coffee was exported to other countries (Table 4.14).

During the post-Forest Act period, the area under tea cultivation has been increased until the colonial period (Table 4.15). Like coffee, tea was also exported to other countries since the post-Forest Act period. The value of tea export has been increased progressively during the post-Forest Act period (Table 4.15).

### **Iron-making and Sugar-boiling Industries**

As I have mentioned earlier, iron deposits were extensively found in the hills in different parts of the country. Later, in 1880s, efforts were made to smelt iron ore by using coal in Raniganj, Birbhum and Manbhum districts of Bengal Presidency, Central Provinces and Kumaun in Northwestern Provinces.106 But these projects were abandoned due to lack of profit. It clearly indicates that the colonial government has encouraged the iron-making industries by extending all kinds of concessions leading to the decline of forest resources in different parts of the country during the early nineteenth century.

### **Railways**

Since the post-Forest Act period, railways continued to grow in different parts of the country. In 1877, 6,024 miles of tracts were laid; and it has

increased to 16,000 miles in 1890, 24,752 miles in 1900; 32,000 miles in 1910; 37,000 miles In 1920; and 40,000 miles in 1947 (Table 4.16). At the time of India Independence, on 15 August 1947, the total length of railway mileage was 40,524 of which 6,539 miles went to Pakistan, sparing India with 33,985 miles.<sup>107</sup> Until 1930, timber was used for various needs of railways—timber plate, berth and fuel. In 1930, timber plate was replaced by steel and fuel wood by coal. In other words, until the establishment of the three-fourths of the railway network in the colonial era, only forest resources were extracted and used. The establishment of the railways, therefore, had not only alienated the forests and other common land but also exploited result in perpetual exploitation of the forest resources throughout the colonial period. Until the introduction of the steel plates to lay down the tracks and coal for fuel, forest resources were ruthlessly exploited on a large scale. In other words, the establishment of railways has resulted in serious and systematic exploitation of forest resources from the late nineteenth century in different parts of the country.

## **Timber and Minor Forest Produce**

Extraction of timber and minor forest produce has increased during the post-Forest Act period. Extraction of timber fuelwood and minor forest produce has increased in terms of both quantity and value during the post-Forest Act period. Between 1903–1904 and 1946–1947, a period of around fifty years, about 10,102,933,866 cubic feet of timber and fuelwood was extracted from the forests. Between 1892–1893 and 1946–1947, i.e., about fifty-five years approximately  $\overline{\mathfrak{F}}$ 427,018,044 worth of minor forest produce was extracted from the forests (Table 4.17). Precisely, even after the enactment of the forest act, a large quantity of timber and other minor forest produce has been extracted from the forests.

# **First World War (1914–1918) and the Second World War (1940–1945)**

During the First World War, forest resources were severely depleted as large quantities of timber were felled to build ships and railway sleepers and also to meet Britain's war efforts. Large-scale supplies of timber, firewood and other forest produce (like hay) were made available to the army.108 'Timber from India's forests were utilized in various mid-Eastern fields of World War I'.109 This massively increased the demand for Indian timber. The Second World War has put even more pressure on the forest as compared to the First World War due to the growing demand. 'Enormous quantities of timber (from almost every wood species) were extracted, causing excessive felling and advance working in almost all forest divisions in the provinces. There were also very extensive over-felling in private forests and forests in Princely States.'110 'In World War II (1939–1945) enormous quantities of timber of many different species were supplied causing excessive fellings and advance working in almost all forest divisions in the Province. There was also extensive over-felling's in private forests of the Princely States. Many varieties of the timber which had not been used previously in any appreciable quantity began to be consumed in large quantities.'<sup>111</sup> Indian forest resources were supplied to the Allied Forces in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf during the Second World War and the forest was also under seize for fuel-wood to offset the loss of coal due to the war efforts.<sup>112</sup>

## **Revenue from the Forest**

In the post-Forest Act era, the Forest Department has extracted a sizeable amount of revenue and the expenditure incurred was always lower than the income ensured. In 1879-1880, about  $\bar{c}$  676,536 worth of revenue was collected from the forest resources whereas the expenditure was only about  $\bar{\mathfrak{Z}} 466,063$  and the net income was about  $\bar{\mathfrak{Z}} 210,473$ (Table 4.18). Though the income has progressively risen during the rest of the colonial period, the expenditure was however lower than the income generated.

## *CONCLUSION*

Until the colonial intervention, only specific forest resources were controlled by the rulers in different kingdoms of the country and all other resources were used by the people without any restrictions. After the colonial intervention, control over the forest resources was extended to a vast amount of forest resources, particularly teak and sandalwood in different parts of the country. To secure revenue from the forest resources, the colonial government has followed different approaches lease, action—either for a particular product or for a particular forest area. For instance, extraction of sandalwood was leased out in different hill regions of Madras Presidency. Indeed, these resources were not only controlled but were also extracted for commercial purposes. In other words, '… the extension of agriculture to feed the European taste for exotic tropical products, such as cotton, tea, sugar, coffee, chocolate, and pepper.'113 Introduction of the commercial crops like coffee and tea in different hills destroyed the forests from the early nineteenth century onwards. In addition to that, the establishment of Indian Railways has made a serious of ecological and environmental impact in the second half of the nineteenth century across the country. Michael Williams states:

The construction of railways was an integral part of British colonial military and commercial policy. They strengthened the control of British rule by facilitating the speedy movement of troops and armaments … second, they augmented British wealth by facilitating the import of British manufactured goods and the export of Indian raw materials, which had implications for land use.<sup>114</sup>

Williams further observes that '… the impact on the forest and the scrub jungles and their wildlife in the immediate vicinity of the railroads was usually stark and severe.'115

Until the 1878 Forest Act, no attempt was made to protect the forest resources. The subsequent forest acts have also helped to bring out more forest areas under the reserve forest category by extensively curtailing the people's rights, especially the tribals over the forests. Even after the enactment of the forest act, the forest department has received a huge amount of revenue from the forest. In other words, while initiating the conservation measures, the colonial government has not pursued this goal in real terms. Even after the introduction of reserve forests, the forest resources have been thoroughly extracted mainly to increase the revenue. Despite the act, the colonial policy continued to guide the commercialisation of the forest resources until the mid-twentieth

century. In addition to this, the couple of World Wars also accentuated the destruction of forest resources. This chapter seeks to conclude that the colonial policies and the initiatives have ignored to accord due importance of the protection of natural resources as they were mainly concerned with the exploitation of these resources that has gradually led to serious and adverse impact on the ecology and environment of the Indian subcontinent during the colonial period.
