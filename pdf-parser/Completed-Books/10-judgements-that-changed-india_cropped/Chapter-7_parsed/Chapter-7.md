# Death in Custody: The Breach of Trust and its Price

#### **Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa (1993)**

*Developing custodial violence jurisprudence and recognizing the right of victims to be compensated for violations of fundamental rights*

![](_page_1_Picture_0.jpeg)

AFTER HAVING EXPANDED the right to life to include the right to compensation for a breach of this right almost eighty years ago, the Supreme Court has continuously reinforced this jurisprudence. The state has yet to meaningfully formalize a response befitting its citizens living in a democracy.

## Introduction

One of the most dangerous cocktails in a democracy is when those who are meant to enforce the law take the law into their own hands. Every week in India, several citizens—usually the poor and those from the weaker sections of society—are killed in police custody. According to the Asian Centre for Human Rights, as many as 1504 custodial deaths were reported to the National Human Rights Commission<sup>1</sup> from April 2001 to March 2010.<sup>2</sup> Most of these deaths occured within forty-eight hours of the victims being taken into police custody. Other reports suggest that there were over a thousand custodial deaths in 2008–09 alone. <sup>3</sup> Let us not forget that these numbers do not reflect a large number of custodial deaths that go unreported in India every year. The most disturbing aspect of custodial violence is that it strikes at the very root of the rule of law in a democracy and shatters the faith of the citizens in the criminal justice system.

If a person is unlawfully detained by the police, the Constitution allows redressal by the filing of a habeas corpus petition under Article 32<sup>4</sup> or 226.<sup>5</sup> Habeas corpus (in Latin, literally '[we command that] you shall have the body') is one of the oldest writ remedies, recognized by courts for centuries. Traditionally, its sole purpose is to have any person under arrest brought to court. Now, if the person has been unlawfully detained, the court can order his release. But what if the remedy loses its meaning even before the court gets to decide the case? What if the person cannot be presented to the court because he has died while in police custody? Prior to the compensatory case law of the Supreme Court, a writ petition in such a case would become meaningless. The only option left to the petitioner would be to file a civil suit for damages against the state for wrongful confinement and a criminal complaint in case of death of the person in custody. Both proceedings would, more often than not, reach a logical conclusion in well over a decade.

Over time, the Supreme Court evolved the remedy of providing compensation to such people, rather than leaving them empty-handed and burdened with the prospect of long-drawn-out legal proceedings. <sup>6</sup> This 'compensatory jurisprudence' is an example of the Supreme Court's judicial creativity, since granting compensation is not an express part of the relevant provisions of the Constitution.

The Indian Constitution does not expressly mandate the granting of compensation for unlawful

detention or custodial death. However, this right is mentioned in several international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 (the ICCPR), one of the most significant global charters on human rights. Article 9(5) of the ICCPR states: '[a]nyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to compensation.' In 1979, India acceded to the ICCPR but with a 'reservation' <sup>7</sup> over this provision:

With reference to Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Government of the Republic of India takes the position that . . . under the Indian legal system, there is no enforceable right to compensation for persons claiming to be victims of unlawful arrest or detention against the State.<sup>8</sup>

The Constitution of India did recognize that both illegal detention and custodial torture deny the fundamental 'right to life', but in the early decades after India's independence, courts did only the following:<sup>9</sup>

- 1. If the complaint pertained to illegal detention, the court ordered that the detained person be set free.
- 2. If there was evidence of illegal detention or custodial violence, the court directed the concerned government to hold an inquiry and take action against the officers responsible.
- 3. If the court was not satisfied by the inquiry conducted or action taken by the relevant government department, it ordered another inquiry by an independent agency, usually, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

# Bhagalpur Blindings and *Rudul Sah*: From Recognizing the Right to Compensation to Enforcing It

The Supreme Court recognized the right to seek compensation via a habeas corpus petition for the first time in the *Khatri v. State of Bihar* cases, better known as the 'Bhagalpur blinding' cases. In 1979–80, police officials at Bhagalpur Central Jail in Bihar blinded thirty-one undertrial prisoners by pouring acid into their eyes. Coming down heavily on the state authorities in a series of cases involving these blindings, the Supreme Court said that it should prepare to 'forge new tools and devise new remedies<sup>'10</sup> for the meaningful enforcement of the right to life, else the right would be reduced to a 'mere rope of sand'.<sup>11</sup> The court conceptualized a right to grant monetary compensation for infringements of the right to life under the Constitution. However, since the investigation of the accused police officers was pending, it did not actually grant any compensation to the victims.<sup>12</sup> In 1980, the CBI Special Magistrate held three officers guilty for the custodial deaths of the undertrials. When the officers appealed to the district and sessions judge and were acquitted, the CBI appealed to the Patna High Court, which upheld the conviction of two of the three accused police officers in the Bhagalpur blindings case.<sup>13</sup>

It took another equally disturbing scenario to prompt the Supreme Court to award compensation for the violation of fundamental rights for the first time in *Rudul Sah v. State of Bihar* 14 (*Rudul Sah*). In 1968, Rudul Sah was acquitted of a murder charge by a criminal court in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, yet he languished in jail for fourteen years after that. In 1982, he filed a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court seeking his release from unlawful custody. He was finally released after he filed the

writ but before the date of the Supreme Court hearing. Though Sah was released, the court continued to hear the matter and demanded an explanation for his prolonged incarceration. Bihar police authorities offered flimsy grounds (principally, that the petitioner was of unsound mind) for keeping Sah in jail. Disapproving strongly of the state's approach to the case, the Supreme Court questioned 'whether it took fourteen years to set right his mental imbalance'. <sup>15</sup> The court also observed that the claim of the petitioner's insanity was 'an afterthought' and 'exaggerated out of proportion' and, if at all he were insane at some stage, the insanity 'must have supervened as a consequence of his unlawful detention in jail', <sup>16</sup> as '[a] sense of helplessness and frustration can create despondency and persistent despondency can lead to a kind of mental imbalance'. 17

A refusal to grant Sah compensation would have been be a grave injustice, tantamount to mere lip service to the right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. The court recognized this and awarded Sah compensation of 30,000 rupees as a 'palliative' for the illegalities committed by the state. The judgement had a few caveats though. First, the court observed that the petitioner would have been relegated to filing a civil suit and instituting criminal proceedings if his claim had been 'factually controversial'. Second, it stated that seeking an award of compensation under Article 32 of the Constitution could not be used as a substitute for filing a regular money claim in a civil court; the court's order granting compensation was attributable to the serious inequities that would have denied immediate compensation to Sah. Finally, the court clarified that the award of compensation would not bar Sah from also invoking the remedy of a civil suit. Clearly, the court's decision signified that the ordinary remedy to seek damages from the state is through ordinary civil (tortious) law. The compensation provided to Sah was an exception—it was an attempt to undo the injustice done unto an innocent man.

The court's decision in *Rudul Sah* has been critiqued because it awarded compensation so meagre that it would barely suffice to assist the victim in pursuing his rights through the 'labyrinthine legal system',<sup>18</sup> let alone balm the wounds of his unlawful incarceration. Since it was the first time that compensation was awarded for violation of fundamental rights, the Supreme Court understandably did not grant a large sum to Sah. However, it did introduce the vitally important element of compensation in constitutional proceedings before the Supreme Court and high courts. Such an expansive interpretation of Article 21 imposed a duty on the state to protect human liberty,<sup>19</sup> or pay a tangible monetary compensation if it failed to do so.

### How the Right to Compensation Was Crystallized

In the decade following *Rudul Sah*, the Supreme Court awarded small sums of compensation as redress for the violation of the right to life under the Constitution. In *Bhim Singh v. State of Jammu and Kashmir*, <sup>20</sup> Bhim Singh, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, was unlawfully arrested to prevent him from attending an Assembly session. His wife filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking his release. Though Bhim Singh was released before the hearing, the court observed that in such cases of illegal detention, the illegality could not be 'washed away or wished away' merely by freeing the person. Since it had the power to award monetary compensation, the court ordered the state to pay Bhim Singh the suitable sum of 50,000 rupees. The court did not elaborate how the amount of compensation was calculated.

In another case, $2<sup>1</sup>$  the Delhi Police colluded with a landlord who wanted to unlawfully evict two female tenants. The two women were beaten up and the nine-year-old son of one of them died due to police brutality. The court ordered compensation of 75,000 rupees to be paid to the mother for the murder of her child.

In another blatant violation of fundamental rights, police authorities in Sholapur, Maharashtra paraded an undertrial prisoner (accused of murder) through the streets, his hands cuffed and his arms tied together.<sup>22</sup> The Supreme Court ordered the state of Maharashtra to pay compensation for this unpardonable act of humiliation, but set the amount at merely 10,000 rupees.

Finally, it was a case involving the high-handedness of Orissa police officials that provided the Supreme Court an opportunity to systematically analyse the right to seek compensation for infractions of Article 21. 23 In *Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa* 24 (*Nilabati Behera*), the court took a simple letter sent by Nilabati Behera to the Supreme Court—stating that her twenty-two-year-old son Suman Behera had died in police custody—and converted it into a writ petition.<sup>25</sup>

The Orissa police had arrested Suman for allegedly committing a theft. Barely a day after he was taken into custody, his dead body was found near a railway track. The lacerations on his body suggested that he had died an unnatural death. His mother sought compensation, claiming that the police had violated her son's right to life under Article 21. Countering that Suman had escaped from police custody and was run over by a passing train, the police and the state disclaimed responsibility for his death. Interestingly, the Additional Solicitor-General appearing for the state did not dispute the state's liability to pay compensation if it were established that Suman actually died in police custody. A doctor deposed before the court that all of Suman's injuries were caused by blunt objects and could have been the result of lathi blows. The medical evidence dismissed the possibility of injury in a train accident.

The court distinguished between the 'public law'<sup>26</sup> remedy of compensation for the violation of fundamental rights from ordinary remedies via private law proceedings like civil suits. The court also took into account 'sovereign immunity' on account of which the state and its officers are immune from legal proceedings relating to any act done in the exercise of the state's 'sovereign functions'.<sup>27</sup> In *Nilabati Behera*, the court asserted that the sovereign immunity defence would not be available in public law proceedings under Article 32<sup>28</sup> or 226<sup>29</sup> of the Constitution, though it could apply to proceedings in private law involving torts committed by the state.

The court also watered down the caveats it had imposed in *Rudul Sah* on awarding compensation for violation of the right to life, stating that it was an 'acknowledged remedy for enforcement and protection' of fundamental rights. It stressed that it would be highly inequitable and unjust to expect a socio-economically disadvantaged person—who did not possess the wherewithal for enforcement of his rights in tort law—to pursue ordinary civil proceedings. It awarded a compensation of 1.5 lakh (150,000) rupees to Nilabati Behera and ordered the state of Orissa to initiate criminal proceedings

against those who killed her son.

Thus, for the very first time, the Supreme Court drew the distinction between compensation as a remedy in public law and private law proceedings. <sup>30</sup> Until the *Nilabati Behera* judgement, compensation was granted on an ad hoc basis, without any structured formulation. The Supreme Court crystallized this remedy into a rule of law through its verdict in 1993.

### Eleven Commandments against Custodial Violence

Ironically, in spite of the emphatic decisions of the Supreme Court strongly condemning all forms of custodial violence, cases of custodial deaths actually increased in the 1980s. In August 1986, D.K. Basu, lawyer and executive chairman of an NGO that provided legal aid services in West Bengal and later appointed a judge of the Calcutta High Court, wrote to the Chief Justice of India to draw his attention to several news articles reporting deaths in police custody. In Basu's words, he wanted to 'persuade the Chief Justice that violence, death, rape, assault and injuries in custody have become the rule of the government in police administration'.<sup>31</sup> He urged that 'the court should . . . prescribe some strong modalities, for the manner in which India's citizens should be treated in police custody'.<sup>32</sup> Treating Basu's letter as a writ petition, the Supreme Court issued notices to all state governments in India<sup>33</sup>—since the question of custodial death had assumed significance on a national scale. It also asked the Law Commission of India to suggest ways to tackle the disturbing situation.

The court lamented the fact that cases of custodial torture and death were on the rise, in spite of constitutional safeguards and legislative protection available to those in police custody. It commented that '[i]f the functionaries of the Government become law breakers, it is bound to breed contempt for law and would encourage lawlessness.<sup>34</sup> It also observed that India's reservation to the ICCPR (on the absence of an enforceable right to compensation) had lost relevance, since the right to claim compensation had been judicially evolved in several cases.

Acting pragmatically, the court declared that punishing the offender in cases of custodial death may not always be enough. It analysed case law in nations like Ireland and New Zealand to firmly establish an enforceable right to compensation against the state in case of violation of fundamental rights. Awarding compensation was perhaps the only effective remedy available in such cases. The court also reiterated the distinction between public law remedies and private law remedies, as discussed in *Nilabati Behera*.

Then, the court listed eleven mandatory requirements for police authorities across India (*see* Appendix I on page 157). These included conducting regular medical examinations of the person in custody, the right to inform a friend or relative of the arrest, access to a lawyer during interrogation, and so on. Not only did the court order that these requirements be circulated to all police stations in India, it also innovatively suggested that they be broadcast on All India Radio and telecast on Doordarshan.

However, there was one very disappointing aspect of the judgement. The Supreme Court's 'eleven
commandments' did not include the right to obtain compensation from the state in all cases of custodial violence. That would have increased awareness of the enforceable right to compensation among citizens, given that the court's guidelines would receive greater publicity and prominence in daily life than the court's judgement. Even ten years after the judgement, Basu regretted this aspect in an interview:

One addition has not been made [to the guidelines of the Supreme Court] that is absolutely necessary: a court should pass an order awarding compensation in cases of death, rape or any kind of injury to anyone while in custody as compensation is presently not prescribed in the guidelines given by the Supreme Court.<sup>35</sup>

### How the Law Evolved after the Basu Judgement

Gradually, the Supreme Court and high courts expanded the people's right to claim compensation from the state in cases besides that of custodial death. In a deplorable incident where a minor committed suicide after being raped in police custody, the Gujarat High Court awarded interim compensation of 1.5 lakh (150,000) rupees even though a departmental inquiry was pending.<sup>36</sup> In another case where a Bangladeshi national was gang-raped by railway employees, the Supreme Court extended the right to seek compensation to foreign nationals—all persons enjoy the right to life under Article 21. 37

The Delhi High Court has been quite progressive in awarding compensation for the negligence of state authorities. In *Shakuntala v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi,* 38 the petitioner's husband, a fruit vendor and the family's sole breadwinner, was fatally injured in a fight between two stray bulls on a Delhi street. He died soon thereafter. His wife claimed that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi had failed miserably in its duty to ensure that stray animals do not roam the streets and sought compensation for her husband's death. The court held:

The relief of compensation under public law, for injuries caused on account of negligent action, or inaction or indifference of public functionaries or for the violation of fundamental rights is a part of the evolving public law jurisprudence in India . . . Compensation under public law must not be merely seen as the monetary equivalent for compensating towards the injury caused, but also understood in the context of the failure of the State or state agency, to protect the valuable rights of the citizens, particularly of the marginalized and the disempowered.<sup>39</sup>

That the court awarded a respectable sum of 10 lakh (1 million) rupees to the petitioner as compensation was not the only important aspect of this judgement. What was equally, if not more, important was that it extended the right to seek compensation to cases where public functionaries and local bodies had been negligent. Thus, it did away with the cloak of 'sovereign immunity' previously enjoyed by public officials as a defence against acts of negligence. A police officer too has benefited from the enforceable right to compensation. In *Shyama Devi v. National Capital Territory of Delhi*, 40 a police constable died a freakish death due to gross negligence—a rocket belonging to the army was not defused. Holding that the right to life is non-negotiable, the court ordered the state to pay a compensation of 3.5 lakh (350,000) rupees to the constable's family. This opened the door to the fact that officers of the state could themselves move court and claim compensation for violation of their

fundamental rights.

#### What Price Is the Right Price?

Ever since the Supreme Court first awarded compensation in *Rudul Sah*, the basis for calculating the quantum of compensation has been a vexed legal issue. After all, granting inadequate or paltry sums of money would only perpetuate the injustice. *Lakshmana Naidu v. State of Tamil Nadu* 41 (*Lakshmana Naidu*) provides an interesting example of how courts determine the quantum of compensation. The petitioners claimed compensation of 5 lakh (500,000) rupees for each of the three persons who died at the hands of forest officials. <sup>42</sup> However, using the 'multiplier method', 43 the court found that the families of the three persons were entitled to over 7 lakh (700,000) rupees each. And yet, surprisingly, the court ruled: 'As the petitioners themselves . . . claimed only 5 lakh rupees as compensation in each of the writ petitions . . . ends of justice would be met if the respondent State is directed to pay a sum of 5 lakh rupees to the petitioners.<sup>'44</sup>

In this case, the court behaved regressively by restricting the compensation to the claimed amount despite acknowledging that the petitioners were entitled to a larger amount. The court's approach went against the very philosophy of the court itself that it should mould remedies to ensure complete justice in exercise of its writ jurisdiction.<sup>45</sup> By reducing the compensation granted to the amount claimed, the court would only encourage petitioners to make extravagant compensation claims to somehow ensure that the amount calculated by the court did not exceed the amount claimed as compensation. The courts should not hesitate in awarding compensation exceeding the claim if they find that the case circumstances justify the claim.

There is no consistency yet in calculating the compensation amount to be granted for violation of the right to life. Although the enforceable right to compensation has been established beyond all doubt in India, the compensation amount has been a matter of debate; different benches across the Supreme Court and the various high courts have applied different approaches and methodologies. The accompanying table shows the compensation awarded by courts in some cases since *Rudul Sah*. From as little as 10,000 rupees awarded by the Supreme Court in 1991 in a case of insult to individual dignity to as much as 10 lakh (1 million) rupees awarded by the Calcutta High Court in 2000 to a victim of rape by railway employees, the calculation of compensation amounts has been erratic and inconsistent. It is extremely important to develop a unified jurisprudence to determine the quantum of compensation for infringements on the right to life, otherwise there is a risk that victims and their families might start to consider a compensation case as a lottery.

### Compensation with Caution

Despite the dozens of cases that have acknowledged the right to award compensation in public law

proceedings, courts still tread cautiously in cases where petitioners seek compensation for the violation of fundamental rights. Firstly, compensation can only be awarded for violation of the right to life under Article 21—no other fundamental right. <sup>46</sup> Moreover, not every violation of the right to life justifies compensation—only violations that shock the court's conscience.<sup>47</sup> Finally, even when the state seriously violates the right to life, compensation can be denied if the petitioner falsifies or exaggerates claims. 48

When the Supreme Court, in the case of *Sube Singh v. State of Haryana*, <sup>49</sup> heard an unsubstantiated claim of illegal detention and torture by the police of a man instead of his son (the accused), despite the fact that the father denied all knowledge of his son's whereabouts, the Supreme Court took the opportunity to define the range of cases where compensation would be awarded on an allegation of custodial torture.<sup>50</sup> It specified three questions that any court must pose when debating whether or not to grant compensation for the violation of fundamental rights:<sup>51</sup>

- 1. Was the violation of the right to life patent and incontrovertible?
- 2. Was the violation gross and of a magnitude to shock the court's conscience?
- 3. Did the custodial torture allegedly result in death or was the custodial torture supported by a medical report or visible marks or scars or disability?

That the Supreme Court is cautious in awarding compensation is understandable—if it does not restrict cases involving grant of compensation for the violation of fundamental rights, it is possible that people, parties or litigants may attempt to enforce private law actions in the garb of public law actions, since courts decide the latter more swiftly.

The court refused to award compensation, citing that there existed a serious dispute as to factum of harassment by police, in a case that received widespread press coverage involving the alleged molestation (though not in custody) by a police officer of a minor girl, Ruchika Girhotra, who later committed suicide.<sup>52</sup> In this case, Ruchika's brother stated that the police systematically framed him in a car theft—to pressurize his family to drop charges against the accused officer—and claimed compensation for the harassment.

#### The How and How Much of Compensation: Why We Need a Law

The Constitution of India does not grant an enforceable right to compensation; yet, the courts have recognized it and awarded it. This reflects how seriously the judiciary wants to respond to the aspirations of the people and become a sentinel of human rights in India.<sup>53</sup> Unfortunately, the seriousness of the judgements has not sufficiently influenced the attitude of the government officials and police authorities. What's more, there is still no definite clarity on the amount of compensation awarded by courts—there is still a preponderant element of chance or 'waywardness'<sup>54</sup> to it. Since no uniform basis has been formulated for the grant of compensation in over three decades, the amounts of compensation awarded have fluctuated from a few thousand rupees in some cases to lakhs of rupees in others. This uncertainty does not help matters.

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, set up by the Atal Behari Vajpayee government in 2000, recommended an amendment to Article 21 to include 'an enforceable right to compensation' for every person illegally deprived of his right to life or liberty. <sup>55</sup> Amending the right to life may be useful to universalize the right to seek compensation, but the need of the hour also is to enact legislation to set out the parameters on which compensation should be granted. It is well worth enacting a separate law to put in place a formal structure to grant monetary compensation in case of violations of the right to life and personal liberty. The law should also focus on providing compensation swifter than, or at least as swiftly as, a writ remedy under Article 32 of the Constitution. If it does not do so, the legislation will become counterproductive and act to the detriment of the citizens.
