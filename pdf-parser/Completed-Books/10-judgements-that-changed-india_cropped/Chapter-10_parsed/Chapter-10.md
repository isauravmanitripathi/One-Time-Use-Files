# Killing me Softly: The Euthanasia Debate in India

**Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug v. Union of India (2011)**

*Accepting passive euthanasia as being constitutional*

![](_page_1_Picture_0.jpeg)

DOES A TERMINALLY ILL person have the right to hasten his death by asking for either his medical treatment to be withdrawn or for a lethal injection to be administered to end his suffering? Do the relatives of a patient, who has been in a permanently vegetative state for so long that she has almost no hope of recovery, have the right to ask for her life-support system to be switched off? This chapter highlights the journey of the judicial system into the highly sensitive and much debated issue of euthanasia.

Euthanasia is a complex ethical issue on which everyone has an opinion: from a child in Class 6 to a media baron of sixty. But the euthanasia issue gets even trickier when it comes to formulating law. Why? Because this is an area where questions of law grapple with moral and ethical values unlike any other. Until 2011, all forms of euthanasia were illegal in India, irrespective of manner, purpose and motive. Even so, euthanasia had and still has many 'silent supporters' in the medical profession. 1 So, when a journalist moved the Supreme Court of India in *Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug v. Union of India* 2 (*Aruna Shanbaug*), asking it to allow a sixty-three-year-old nurse who had spent more than half her life in a vegetative state to die peacefully, the court stepped in to answer a question even though it felt like 'a ship in an uncharted sea'.

## Suicide Law and the 'Right to Die'

What is the difference between euthanasia and suicide? This is tough to answer because the two concepts are very closely interlinked and the dividing line between them is very thin. Euthanasia denotes causing the death of incurable or terminally-ill patients; and the meaning of suicide is universally known. It is hard to imagine a legal system where the relatives of a patient in a vegetative state can decide to end his life while a fully competent adult is not allowed to end his own.

An attempt to commit suicide is a criminal offence in India, punishable with imprisonment of up to one year and a fine under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (the IPC). It is a unique offence —if you fail, you are punished, but if you succeed, you are not—since, of course, a 'successful' suicide means that there is no one to punish. Those who abet suicide can be imprisoned for up to ten years and fined under Section 306 of the IPC. For a long time, this was the only safeguard against the instigation of *sati* 3 in India.

The law penalizing suicide attempts has been widely criticized over the last few decades. As early as 1971, the Law Commission of India recommended that Section 309 of the IPC, a 'harsh and unjustifiable' provision, should be deleted. 4 It has also been constitutionally challenged several times before high courts and the Supreme Court. The Delhi High Court once observed that it was a

'[s]trange paradox that in the age of votaries of euthanasia, suicide should be criminally punishable'. 5

In 1985, *Maruti Dubal v. State of Maharashtra* 6 (*Maruti Dubal*), a police constable was so despondent with the inaction of government authorities that he tried to immolate himself outside the office of Bombay's municipal commissioner. When criminal charges were pressed against him, he challenged Section 309 of the IPC in the Bombay High Court, saying that it violates Articles 14 <sup>7</sup> and 21<sup>8</sup> of the Constitution. The court accepted the challenge and agreed that there was 'nothing unnatural about the desire to die'.<sup>9</sup> It also said that every man is the master of his own body and has the right to deal with it as he pleases. A person who attempts suicide, whether due to mental disorder or physical ailment, needs treatment and care more than imprisonment. The court concluded that the constitutional right to live includes the 'right not to live' or the right to end one's life. <sup>10</sup> The Bombay High Court held that Section 309 was ultra vires or 'beyond the powers' of the Constitution and struck it down. All prosecutions instituted against the petitioner under Section 309 were quashed.

However, in a case in the following year, the Andhra Pradesh High Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 309 of the IPC.<sup>11</sup> The court found that a law punishing an attempt to commit suicide was an important tool in the age of hunger strikes and self-immolation threats. It also held that not every case under Section 309 would necessarily result in punishment or imprisonment; the section only defined the upper limits of possible punishment.

Is it constitutionally permissible to penalize suicide? This question arose in the Supreme Court in *P. Rathinam v. Union of India* 12 (*Rathinam*). Hearing the writ petition challenging the constitutional validity of Section 309, the court rightly held that an attempt to commit suicide indicated a psychological problem rather than any criminal instinct. After weighing every possible legal and moral implication of treating a suicide attempt as a criminal offence, the court struck down Section 309 of the IPC as being void and ineffectual. In fact, the court held that Section 309 contravened the right to life under Article 21.

The Supreme Court's judgement in *Rathinam* did not hold for long. In *Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab* 13 (*Gian Kaur*), a married couple appealed against their conviction for abetting suicide under Section 306. They argued that since the 'right to die' fell within the ambit of the right to life under Article 21 (as the Supreme Court held in *Rathinam*), a person who helped another commit suicide would merely be facilitating the enforcement of a fundamental right, implying that Section 306 of the IPC which penalized abetment of suicide, was also unconstitutional.

This logic was clearly flawed and the Supreme Court rejected the argument, and rightly so. However, it also overruled its earlier judgement in *Rathinam*<sup>14</sup> and ruled afresh that the constitutional right to life did not include the right to die. So, Section 309 was once again held to be constitutionally valid and effective. The court asserted:

We find it difficult to construe Article 21 to include within it the "right to die" as a part of the fundamental right guaranteed therein. "Right to life" is a natural right embodied in Article 21, but suicide is an unnatural termination or extinction of life and, therefore, incompatible and inconsistent with the concept of "right to life".<sup>15</sup>

The court highlighted the difference between the desirability of a law and the constitutionality of a law. Although a law may not be desirable, it could be struck down as unconstitutional only if it

infringed on specific provisions of the constitution. Now, since Section 309 did not actually contravene any constitutional provision, it would stay valid. After the two-year window during which a suicide attempt was not illegal (from *Rathinam* to *Gian Kaur*), the Supreme Court restored the position that committing and abetting suicide were both punishable crimes.

The *Gian Kaur* judgement was interesting for another reason. It opened a window of opportunity to legalize euthanasia within the existing legal framework. The court held that though the constitutional right to life did not include the right to die, it did encompass the 'right to die with dignity'. 16 However, the right to die with dignity was not to be confused with the right to die an unnatural death, one which cut short the natural span of life. In the cases of persons who were terminally ill or in a vegetative state, the process of natural death had already commenced, and so it was possible to reason that accelerating that process would be consistent with the right to life as enshrined in the Constitution.

And then, in 2000, two remarkable 'suicide petitions' were filed in the Kerala High Court.<sup>17</sup> A retired octogenarian teacher felt that he had led a satisfactory life, having fulfilled all his duties and obligations, such as ensuring that his children were settled and happy. He wished to 'quit the world', but not commit suicide—a fact he acknowledged was against the law and distinguishable from his desire for a 'voluntary death'. He wanted to end his life legally by donating his organs. He wanted to highlight the difference between 'voluntary death' and suicide, based on motives. In fact, he suggested that 'voluntary death clinics' be set up in every district of Kerala to assist others who felt the same. Encouraged by this, another sixty-nine-year-old school principal made a similar plea before the high court.

The Kerala High Court rejected both petitions, affirming that suicide was suicide, regardless of the motives. As its grounds for refusing the two pleas, the court said that not only would the death of a healthy person cause a loss to society, but there was also the possibility that this 'right to die' be misused in the future.

## How a Sprightly Nurse Ended Up As a Lifelong, Lifeless Patient

Aruna Shanbaug was a nurse at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Mumbai (then Bombay). On the evening of 27 November 1973, Aruna, then 25, was changing her clothes in a room meant for experimental surgeries on dogs,<sup>18</sup> when a hospital sweeper assaulted her. Intending to rape her, he immobilized Aruna by twisting a dog chain around her neck; but when he discovered that she was menstruating, he sodomized her instead. She was found nearly twelve hours later, unconscious.

Aruna suffered acute brain damage because the oxygen supply to her brain had been blocked for a long period of time.<sup>19</sup> She never recovered from the attack and was relegated to the status of a helpless patient for the rest of her life. Today, forty years later, Aruna is still in a vegetative state, a lifelong patient. In 2009, journalist Pinki Virani—who had followed Aruna's life closely and also written *Aruna's Story*, a book on her life<sup>20</sup>—moved the Supreme Court, seeking a direction for KEM Hospital to stop feeding Aruna Shanbaug in order that she may exercise her right to die in peace and dignity.

Virani alleged that Aruna was a featherweight; her bones were brittle; her skin was like papier maché, her teeth were decayed. She had lost the ability to see and hear, as well as her complete awareness. She was fed a diet of mashed food which she could not consciously swallow. Aruna had no quality of life; she expressed no human emotions and there was little hope of her ever recovering.

The Mumbai Municipal Corporation and the dean of KEM Hospital filed a counter-affidavit stating that Aruna accepted food normally and responded via facial expressions or intermittent sounds. The Supreme Court set up a team of three doctors to objectively report to it on Aruna's physical and mental state. The court also allowed a video recording of Aruna's condition to be screened in the courtroom. Interestingly, the court found support for conducting a screening in a courtroom from the Nuremberg trials<sup>21</sup> in Germany, though it is questionable whether the court should have compared the examination of Aruna's condition with Nazi atrocities during World War II! Screening the video in open court could have been avoided and the result was ironic—though the court ruled that Aruna was still 'alive' and that hers was not a case fit for euthanasia, the bench itself treated her as an inanimate object of examination. Essentially, the Supreme Court overlooked Aruna's right to privacy.

To Die or Not to Die?

The doctors' report<sup>22</sup> stated that Aruna seemed to be in a permanent vegetative state in many respects, but she was neither brain-dead nor comatose—she possessed some reflexes, could make symmetric facial movements, articulated some vocal sounds (though she could not respond to simple commands) and partially licked sugar smeared on her lips. The team concluded that since Aruna was not in a position to take a decision, the appropriate person to do so would be the dean of KEM Hospital, since it was the hospital staff that had tended to her for thirty-seven years.

In his affidavit, the dean Dr Sanjay Oak said that Aruna should not be subjected to passive euthanasia. In fact, he asserted that India was not ready to allow the legalization of euthanasia:<sup>23</sup> 'I feel that the entire society has not matured enough to accept the execution of an Act of Euthanasia or Mercy Killing. I fear that this may get misused and our monitoring and deterring mechanisms may fail to prevent those unfortunate incidences.'

In its judgement, the Supreme Court endorsed the recommendation of the team of doctors that the dean was best placed to decide on the euthanasia plea as Aruna's 'next friend', <sup>24</sup> since the KEM Hospital staff had taken care of her for three decades when her family abandoned her. The court believed that Pinki Virani could not claim the level of attachment or bonding with Aruna that the hospital authorities could and did.<sup>25</sup> Also, based on reasons similar to those in the doctors' report, the court asserted that though Aruna had 'very little' brain activity, she was not brain-dead.

Since the dean had unequivocally dismissed the possibility of euthanasia for Aruna and said that she should be allowed to die a natural death, the case could have been wrapped up at that stage.

However, the Supreme Court chose to go beyond its call of duty, by deciding on the larger question: should euthanasia be permissible at all in India, and, if so, under what circumstances?

The court distinguished between two forms of euthanasia: active and passive. 'Active euthanasia' denotes the use of lethal substances to end a person's life, while 'passive euthanasia' entails the withholding of any medical treatment (such as life-saving antibiotics) that would ensure the survival of a patient. The difference between the two is that in case of active euthanasia the procedure that causes death would have caused the death of any person, regardless of the person's physical condition (for instance, the use of a lethal injection). This is not so in the case of passive euthanasia. In several countries, such as Ireland, passive euthanasia is permitted whereas active euthanasia is prohibited. Active euthanasia is illegal all over the United States of America while passive euthanasia is permitted in three of its states. In Mexico, active euthanasia is illegal, but passive euthanasia is permitted in Mexico City, the central state of Aguascalientes and the western state of Michoacán; the Mexican Senate has approved a law to extend the same provisions to the national level.

The Supreme Court outlined a rather tenuous distinction between an 'act' and an 'omission' to legalize passive euthanasia while reiterating the illegality of active euthanasia. It declared passive euthanasia as permissible (or, at least, not illegal), using the rationale that 'failing to save a person' could never constitute a crime. On the other hand, it confirmed that active euthanasia—because it involves a deliberate act by a third party, usually a doctor—would be tantamount to murder since death is caused by a positive 'action' rather than a mere 'omission to act'. The court offered the example of a bystander running into a burning building to rescue someone—if the bystander did not in fact try to rescue the person, he would not be guilty of committing an offence. It is questionable, though, whether a doctor administering medical treatment is comparable to a person entering a burning building to save someone. After all, a doctor does not risk his own life to administer medical aid.

The court also differentiated between voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia. Voluntary euthanasia is when the patient is in a position to express consent while non-voluntary euthanasia is when the patient is not in such a position, being comatose for instance. Cases of non-voluntary euthanasia involve many complexities, since it is necessary that a surrogate or 'next friend' takes the decision on behalf of the patient. The Supreme Court set up a high-court-monitored mechanism to handle such cases. <sup>26</sup> What the court essentially did in *Aruna Shanbaug* was to follow a method it thought most appropriate and establish that method as a benchmark for all high courts to deal with cases seeking approval for passive euthanasia. The model includes appointing a team of doctors (comprising a neurologist, psychiatrist and physician) to report to the court, issue notices to the state and close relatives of the patient and so on. It would ultimately be up to the court to determine if the case were fit for permitting passive euthanasia, after considering the doctors' report and the next friend's opinion. This mechanism was to operate until Parliament passed legislation on the subject—a practice that has been employed by the Supreme Court on a few occasions, notably in *Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan*. 27

The court also noted that if the representatives of KEM Hospital changed their decision at any

stage, they would be free to move the Bombay High Court (according to the method above) with a euthanasia plea on behalf of Aruna.

It is interesting to note the sources the Supreme Court used to arrive at its decision. It relied primarily on foreign cases, even though some relevant Indian case law was available. The court discussed judgements and statutory law from regions including Canada, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. It extensively cited the judgement of the House of Lords (the United Kingdom) in *Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland*, 28 in which a patient was allowed to die through the withdrawal of life-supporting treatment. The court also relied on sources such as George Bernard Shaw's play *The Doctor's Dilemma*, Robin Cook's novel *Coma* and even Google! Paragraph 103 of the judgement said that a news item the bench encountered on the internet told the story of Terry Wallis from America, who slipped into a coma after an accident in 1984, but regained consciousness twenty-four years later due to nerve regeneration in his brain. The bench also referred to a related medical case, stating 'see Terri Schiavo's case on Google'.

Thus, the window of opportunity left open by the Supreme Court in *Gian Kaur* was taken up in the *Aruna Shanbaug* case. In the latter, while the court reiterated that suicide is a criminal offence, it nevertheless permitted passive euthanasia in certain situations. In legal terms, the court held that while the 'right to life' under Article 21 includes the 'right to die with dignity', it does not include the 'right to die' per se*.* In other words, suicide is illegal and punishable, but passive euthanasia is legal under certain circumstances. However, the court did recommend the deletion of Section 309 of the IPC, finding it 'anachronistic' and underscoring that a person who attempts suicide 'needs help rather than punishment'. 29

### Too 'Moral' for Courts to Decide?

The *Aruna Shanbaug* judgement has been criticized on account of the fact that the very subject of passive euthanasia hinges on a moral question. Apart from legal, there are moral arguments for and against passive euthanasia. The legislature—an elected body expected to keep its finger firmly on the pulse of public opinion—is arguably better placed to take the call.

If we were to judge the morality of the court's judgement, is the 'passive–active distinction' morally sound? The moral justification for allowing passive euthanasia against active euthanasia is not convincing. After all, depriving a patient of food (thus causing death by starvation) or antibiotics (thus causing a painful death) seems far more merciless than administering an instant and painless dose of death. The difference between the two forms of euthanasia hinges on a questionable dichotomy: 'killing' is not the same as 'allowing to die'. <sup>30</sup> All that it means is that in a case of passive euthanasia, the doctor can say, 'I did not kill him. His death was only expedited by an *omission to administer* medical treatment.' Well, if an act comprising active euthanasia is murder, passive euthanasia would not be very far from it. The only practical difference is that active euthanasia can be abused/misused more than passive euthanasia, since even a healthy patient would die via an active

euthanasia procedure. Also, unlike passive euthanasia, active euthanasia leaves no room for miracles of nature.

On the other hand, there is also significant concern over the Supreme Court's decision that Aruna Shanbaug should not be subjected to passive euthanasia. The court may have been carried away by the pleas of the dean and nurses of KEM Hospital. No one can question the dedication with which Aruna has been taken care of for close to four decades, but is it in her best interests to stay 'alive'? The 'quality of life' element and the 'best interests of the patient' test $31$  should have played a much larger role in the court's judgement. Can the fact that Aruna can partially lick off sugar smeared on her lips or that she does not have bed sores justify the quality of her existence?

Another disquieting aspect of the judgement is its inherent potential to deepen the rich–poor divide. If a person from the lower middle class wishes to keep his relative (who is in a vegetative state) alive, will the state bear the monetary costs, not to mention the opportunity costs of the hospital bed dedicated to this purpose? If not, doesn't this judgement seal the fate of those who cannot afford medical care for a long period?<sup>32</sup>

There is also a positive aspect of the *Aruna Shanbaug* judgement. In Pinki Virani's words, 'Aruna's other gift through this same landmark judgement is that there could be a boost in organ donations, once again positively helping millions of Indians. The judgement provides clarity on the definition of brain death. Healthy vital organs are wasted while arguments rage over medico-legal definition of brain death.' 33

### A Review of the Law on Euthanasia and Suicide

After *Aruna Shanbaug*, the position on euthanasia in India today is that while the law recognizes euthanasia in case of physical suffering, no amount of mental suffering would justify a claim to end a person's life. In fact, the law will penalize a suicide attempt in the latter scenario. Therefore, while relatives of a patient in a permanently vegetative state can consent to the use of a passive euthanasia procedure, a healthy adult who voluntarily attempts suicide risks being punished if his/her attempt fails. This is inconsistent. Lawmakers would do well to seriously debate the Supreme Court's recommendation to delete Section 309 of the IPC.

Doctors have documented that passive euthanasia is already practised in India today. The difference that the judgement could make is that when there is a disagreement among the patient's relatives or between the relatives and the physicians over employing a euthanasia procedure, the high court may be moved to decide on the final route to be taken.<sup>34</sup>

The Supreme Court's decision is added to the guidelines formulated by it that are meant to operate 'until the legislature enacts a suitable law on the issue'. There is an urgent need to comprehensively review the law on euthanasia and suicide in India—a Supreme Court judgement being used as a substitute for an enacted law should not be allowed to hold the field for too long. Many factors, including the commercialization of healthcare, the allocation/scarcity of medical resources, the
development of sound mechanisms to prevent abuse of euthanasia (if permitted), and a thorough understanding of the 'active–passive distinction' should be taken into account to frame policy on the subject. One can only hope that this will not be another area of law in which the Supreme Court's decision is conveniently left by the legislature to hold the field.

One last question remains—a tough question to answer. What does one do with cases like Jan Grzebski, who regained consciousness after a nineteen-year coma caused by a brain tumour or Terry Wallis who met with a car accident and regained consciousness two decades on or Dan Cassil, who was revived from a deep coma on hearing his favourite TV show *Seinfeld*?

# APPENDIX I

**The following, excerpted from the Supreme Court ruling in** *Aruna Shanbaug*, **<sup>35</sup> sets out the procedure to be adopted by high courts when an application for 'non-voluntary euthanasia' is filed.**

- On the filing of an application for 'non-voluntary euthanasia', the Chief Justice of the High Court should forthwith constitute a bench of at least two judges who should decide to grant approval or not. Before doing so, the bench should seek the opinion of a committee of three reputed doctors to be nominated by the bench after consulting such medical authorities/practitioners as it may deem fit. Preferably, one of the three doctors should be a neurologist, one a psychiatrist, and one a physician. For this purpose, a panel of doctors in every city may be prepared by the high court in consultation with the state government/Union Territory, and their fees for this purpose may be fixed beforehand.
- The committee of three doctors nominated by the bench should carefully examine the patient and also consult the record of the patient as well as take the views of the hospital staff and submit its report to the bench.
- Simultaneously, with the appointment of the committee of doctors, the bench shall also issue notice to the State and close relatives (for example, the parents, spouse, brother(s)/ sister(s)) of the patient, and in their absence his/her next friend, and supply a copy of the report of the doctor's committee to them as soon as it is available. After hearing them, the bench should give its verdict. The above procedure should be followed all over India until the Parliament makes legislation on this subject.
- The high court should give its decision at the earliest, since a delay in the matter may result in causing great mental agony to the relatives and persons close to the patient.
- The high court should give its decision assigning specific reasons in accordance with the principle of 'best interest of the patient' laid down by the House of Lords in Airedale's case. The views of

the near relatives and committee of doctors should be given due weight by the high court before pronouncing a final verdict which shall not be summary in nature.

## APPENDIX II

**The following report, directly excerpted from the Supreme Court ruling in** *Aruna Shanbaug*, **was submitted by the team of doctors to the Supreme Court, examining the physical and mental condition of Ms Aruna Shanbaug.**

Report of examination of Ms Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug jointly prepared and signed by:

1. Dr J.V. Divatia (Professor and Head, Department of Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Pain, at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai)

2. Dr Roop Gursahani (Consultant Neurologist at P.D. Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai)

3. Dr Nilesh Shah (Professor and Head, Department of Psychiatry at Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Corporation Medical College and General Hospital)

### I. Background

As per the request of Hon. Justice Katju and Hon. Justice Mishra of the Supreme Court of India, Ms Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug, a 60-year-old female patient was examined on the morning of 28 January 2011, and 3 February 2011, in the side-room of ward-4, of the K.E.M. Hospital by a team of three doctors viz., Dr J.V. Divatia (Professor and Head, Department of Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Pain at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai), Dr Roop Gursahani (Consultant Neurologist at P.D. Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai) and Dr Nilesh Shah (Professor and Head, Department of Psychiatry at Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Corporation Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai).

This committee was set up because the court found some variance between the allegations in the writ petition filed by Ms Pinki Virani on behalf of Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug and the counteraffidavit of Dr Pazare. This team of three doctors was appointed to examine Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug thoroughly and give a report to the Court about her physical and mental condition.

It was felt by the team of doctors appointed by the Supreme Court that longitudinal case history and observations of the last thirty-seven years along with findings of the examination will give a better, clear and comprehensive picture of the patient's condition.

This report is based on:

<sup>1.</sup> The longitudinal case history and observations obtained from the dean and the medical and nursing staff of K.E.M. Hospital;

<sup>2.</sup> Case records (including nursing records) since January 2010;

<sup>3.</sup> Findings of the physical, neurological and mentalstatus examinations performed by the panel; and

4. Investigations performed during the course of this assessment (blood tests, CT head, electroencephalogram).

## II. Medical History

The medical history of Ms Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug was obtained from the dean, the principal of the School of Nursing, and the medical and nursing staff of ward-4 who have been looking after her.

#### It was learnt from the persons mentioned above that:

- 1. Ms Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug was admitted in the hospital after she was assaulted and strangulated by a sweeper of the hospital on 27 November 1973.
- 2. Though she survived, she never fully recovered from the trauma and brain damage resulting from the assault and strangulation.
- 3. Since the last many years she has been in the same bed in the side-room of ward-4.
- 4. The hospital staff has provided her with excellent nursing care since then, which included feeding her by mouth, bathing her and taking care of her toilet needs. The care was of such an exceptional nature that she has not developed a single bed sore or fracture in spite of her bedridden state since 1973.
- 5. According to the history related by them, though she is not too aware of herself and her surroundings, she somehow recognizes the presence of people around her and expresses her like or dislike by making certain types of vocalsounds and waving her hands in certain manners. She appears to be happy and smiles when she receives her favourite food items like fish and chicken soup. She accepts food which she likes, but may spit out food she doesn't like. She was able to take oral feeds till 16 September 2010, which is when she developed a febrile illness, probably malaria. After that, her oral intake reduced and a feeding tube (Ryle's tube) was passed into her stomach via her nose. Since then she receives her major feeds from the Ryle's tube, and is only occasionally able to accept oral liquids. Malaria has taken a toll on her physical condition, but she is gradually recuperating from it.
- 6. Occasionally, when there are many people in the room she makes vocalsounds indicating distress. She calms down when people move out of her room. She also seems to enjoy the devotional songs and music which is played in her room and it has a calming effect on her.
- 7. In an annual ritual, each and every batch of nursing students is introduced to Ms Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug, and is told that 'She was one of us'; 'She was a very nice and efficient staff nurse, but due to the mishap she is in this bedridden state'.
- 8. The entire nursing staff and other staff members have a very compassionate attitude towards Ms Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug and they all, very happily and willingly, take care of her. They all are very proud of their achievement of taking such good care of their bedridden colleague and feel very strongly that they want to continue to take care of her in the same manner till she succumbs naturally. They do not feel that Ms Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug is living a painful and miserable life.

### III. Examination

### *IIIa. Physical Examination*

She was conscious, but unable to cooperate and appeared to be unaware of her surroundings. Her body was lean and thin. She appeared neat and clean and lay curled up in the bed with movements of the left hand and made sounds, especially when many people were present in the room.

She was afebrile, and her pulse rate was 80/min, regular and good volume. Her blood pressure recorded on the nursing charts was normal. Respiratory rate was 15/min, regular, with no signs of respiratory distress or breathlessness. There was no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or icterus. She was edentulous (lacking teeth). Skin appeared to be generally in good condition; there were no bed sores, bruises or evidence of old healed bed sores. There were no skin signs suggestive of nutritional

deficiency or dehydration. Her wrists had developed severe contractures, and were fixed in acute flexion. Both knees had also developed contractures (right more than left). A nasogastric feeding tube (Ryle's tube) was in situ. She was wearing diapers.

Abdominal, respiratory and cardiovascular examination was unremarkable.

#### *IIIb. Neurological Examination*

When examined she was conscious with eyes open, wakefulness but without any apparent awareness (*see* Table 1 for detailed assessment of awareness). From the above examination, she has evidence of intact auditory, visual, somatic and motor primary neural pathways. However, no definitive evidence for awareness of auditory, visual, somatic and motor stimuli was observed during our examinations.

There was no coherent response to verbal commands or to calling her name. She did not turn her head to the direction of sounds or voices. When roused she made non-specific unintelligible sounds ('uhhh, ahhh') loudly and continuously, but was generally silent when undisturbed.

Menace reflex (blinking in response to hand movements in front of eyes) was present in both eyes and hemifields, but brisker and more consistent on the left. Pupillary reaction was normal bilaterally. Fundi could not be seen since she closed her eyes tightly when this was attempted. At rest she seemed to maintain preferential gaze to the left, but otherwise gaze was random and undirected (roving) though largely conjugate. Facial movements were symmetric. Gag reflex (movement of the palate in response to insertion of a tongue depressor in the throat) was present and she does not pool saliva. She could swallow both teaspoonfuls of water as well as a small quantity of mashed banana. She licked, though not very completely, sugar smeared on her lips, suggesting some tongue control.

She had flexion contractures of all limbs and seemed to be incapable of turning in bed spontaneously. There was what appeared to be minimal voluntary movement with the left upper limb (touching her wrist to the eye for instance, perhaps as an attempt to rub it). When examined/disturbed, she seemed to curl up even further in her flexed foetal position. Sensory examination was not possible, but she did seem to find passive movement painful in all four limbs and moaned continuously during the examination. Deep tendon reflexes were difficult to elicit elsewhere, but were present at the ankles. Plantars were withdrawal/extensor.

Thus, neurologically, she appears to be in a state of intact consciousness without awareness of self/environment. No cognitive or communication abilities could be discerned. Visual function, if present, is severely limited. Motor function is grossly impaired with quadriparesis.

#### *IIIc. Mental Status Examination*

1. Consciousness, General Appearance, Attitude and Behaviour: Ms Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug was resting quietly in her bed, apparently listening to devotional music, when we entered the room. Though her body build is lean, she appeared to be well nourished and there were no signs of malnourishment. She appeared neat and clean. She has developed contractures at both the wrist joints and knee joints and so lay curled up in the bed with minimum, restricted physical movements.

She was conscious, but appeared to be unaware of herself and her surroundings. As soon as she realized the presence of some people in her room, she started making repetitive vocalsounds and moving her hands. This behaviour subsided as we left the room. She did not have any involuntary movements. She did not demonstrate any catatonic, hostile or violent behaviour.

Her eyes were wide open and from her behaviour it appeared that she could see and hear us, as when one loudly called her

name, she stopped making vocal sounds and hand movements for a while. She was unable to maintain sustained eye-to eye contact, but when the hand was suddenly taken near her eyes, she was able to blink well.

When an attempt was made to feed her by mouth, she accepted a spoonful of water, some sugar and mashed banana. She also licked the sugar and banana paste sticking on her upper lips and swallowed it. Thus, at times, she could cooperate when fed.

- 2. Mood and effect: It was difficult to assess her mood as she was unable to communicate or express her feelings. She appeared to calm down when she was touched or caressed gently. She did not cry or laugh or express any other emotions verbally or non-verbally during the examination period. When not disturbed and observed quietly from a distance, she did not appear to be in severe pain or misery. Only when many people enter her room, she appears to get a bit disturbed about it.
- 3. Speech and thoughts: She could make repeated vocalsounds but she could not utter or repeat any comprehensible words or follow and respond to any of the simple commands (such as 'show me your tongue'). The only way she expressed herself was by making some sounds. She appeared to have minimal language comprehension or expression.
- 4. Perception: She did not appear to be having any perceptual abnormality like hallucinations or illusions from her behaviour.
- 5. Orientation, memory and intellectual capacity: Formal assessment of orientation in time, place and person, memory of immediate, recent and remote events and her intellectual capacity could not be carried out.
- 6. Insight: As she does not appear to be fully aware of herself and her surroundings, she is unlikely to have any insight into her illness.

## IV. Reports of Investigations

### *IVa. CT Scan Head (Plain)*

This is contaminated by movement artefacts. It shows generalized prominence of supratentorial sulci and ventricles suggestive of generalized cerebral atrophy. Brainstem and cerebellum seem normal. Ischaemic foci are seen in left centrum semiovale and right external capsule. In addition a small left parieto-occipital cortical lesion is also seen and is probably ischaemic.

### *IVb. EEG*

The dominant feature is a moderately rhythmic alpha frequency at 8-10 Hz and 20-70 microvolts which is widely distributed and is equally prominent both anteriorly and posteriorly. It is not responsive to eye-opening as seen on the video. Beta at 18-25 Hz is also seen diffusely but more prominently anteriorly. No focal or paroxysmal abnormalities were noted.

### *IVc. Blood*

Reports of the haemoglobin, white cell count, liver function tests, renal function tests, electrolytes, thyroid function, Vitamin B12 and 1, 25 dihydroxy Vit D3 levels are unremarkable.

## V. Diagnostic Impression

<sup>1.</sup> From the longitudinal case history and examination, it appears that Ms Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug has developed nonprogressive, but irreversible brain damage secondary to hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury consistent with the known effects of strangulation. Most authorities consider a period exceeding four weeks in this condition, especially when due to hypoxic-

ischaemic injury as confirming irreversibility. In Ms Aruna's case, this period has been as long as thirty-seven years, making her perhaps the longest survivor in this situation.

2. She meets most of the criteria for being in a permanent vegetative state (PVS). PVS is defined as a clinical condition of unawareness (Table 1) of self and environment in which the patient breathes spontaneously, has a stable circulation and shows cycles of eye closure and opening which may simulate sleep and waking (Table 2). While she has evidence of intact auditory, visual, somatic and motor primary neural pathways, no definitive evidence for awareness of auditory, visual, somatic and motor stimuli was observed during our examinations.

### VI. Prognosis

Her dementia has not progressed and has remained stable for last many years and it is likely to remain same over next many years. At present there is no treatment available for the brain damage she has sustained.
