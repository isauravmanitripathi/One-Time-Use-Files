*Settling the power of the Supreme Court of India to make judicial appointments*

NO DEMOCRACY CAN flourish without an independent judicial system, a system free from fear or favour, a system isolated from the other branches of government. It enhances the prosperity and stability of the social order.<sup>1</sup> Too often, civil society undermines the importance of an independent judiciary while legal professionals overlook it. <sup>2</sup> Today, the activist Indian judiciary adjudicates disputes as diverse as river water distribution between states, the legality of a governor's proclamation of President's rule in a state, and even matters involving allegations of corruption by high-ranking public officials including the Prime Minister and members of Parliament. In fact, in the context of the Indian democracy, citizens disillusioned with the political system often resort to the Supreme Court as their last hope. In such circumstances, it is imperative to safeguard the independence of the judiciary so that it continues to play a proactive role in our democracy.

The Constitution includes several mechanisms, such as the following, to protect the independence of judges of the Supreme Court and high courts:

- 1. Judges can be removed only through a cumbersome 'impeachment motion' in the Parliament and only on grounds of proven misbehaviour or incapacity.<sup>3</sup>
- 2. The service conditions of judges cannot be altered to their detriment during their terms of office.<sup>4</sup>
- 3. The Parliament is barred from discussing the conduct of judges except in the case of an impeachment motion.<sup>5</sup>
- 4. The administrative expenses of courts are charged to the Consolidated Fund<sup>6</sup> of India or of the relevant state, and are not subject to discussion in the Parliament.<sup>7</sup>

However, these provisions alone cannot preserve judicial integrity. The powers to appoint or not appoint, to transfer or not transfer, and to promote or not promote judges are equally important elements that influence the independent standing of the judiciary. 8

Article 124 of the Constitution says that every judge of the Supreme Court should be appointed by the President <sup>9</sup> after consulting the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and other judges of the Supreme Court and high courts. As for the judges of the twenty-one high courts in India, Article 217 says that every high court judge should be appointed by the President after consulting with the CJI, the governor of the relevant state and the chief justice of that high court. The President is empowered to transfer a judge from one high court to another after consulting with the CJI.<sup>10</sup> The Constitution also enables the President to appoint 'additional judges' for a maximum of two years to meet a temporary increase in business or work arrears in any high court. <sup>11</sup> These provisions seem fairly clear. However, subsequent developments since the promulgation of the Constitution (political as well as legal) have complicated the way that simple expressions concerning the higher judiciary are interpreted.

## Appointment of Judges in Practice

The makers of our Constitution believed that they had done whatever they possibly could to secure the independence of the judiciary. <sup>12</sup> The Constitution was drafted with the hope that the executive and the judiciary would work in unison to ensure that judicial appointments are based on merit. Expressions such as 'consultation' (between the President and the CJI) were deliberately used to ensure that no single authority would wield absolute power.

In the early years of Indian democracy, judicial appointments were made according to plan.<sup>13</sup> As a healthy practice, the opinions of the CJI and the chief justice of the appropriate high court were considered as most relevant in making appointments. This changed drastically under the Indira Gandhi-led Congress government of the 1970s, the decade that witnessed sharp conflicts between the political class and the judiciary.<sup>14</sup> In an unprecedented act of supersession which left India stunned, Justice A.N. Ray suddenly became the CJI, bypassing the three senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, Justices J.M. Shelat, K.S. Hegde and A.N. Grover who had earlier pronounced judgements<sup>15</sup> that had not found favour with the Congress government.

Democracy needed rescuing. And here began a bitter struggle for power between the judiciary and the executive. The power to transfer high court judges under the Constitution was meant to be used only in certain exigencies—never to penalize independent judges. During the twenty-one-month long national Emergency between 1975 and 1977, as many as fifty-six high court judges were transferred from their home high court to high courts in other states as punishment for not falling in line with the policies of the Indira Gandhi government.<sup>16</sup> Sixteen of these judges were transferred on one day alone. <sup>17</sup> One of the judges, Justice Sankalchand Sheth—transferred from the Gujarat High Court to the Andhra Pradesh High Court—challenged the constitutional validity of the presidential notification in a writ petition before the Gujarat High Court. The Gujarat High Court allowed the writ petition on the ground that the President had not effectively consulted the CJI in making the transfer. In 1976, the Union of India filed an appeal; the Supreme Court disposed it on the government's assurance that it would transfer Justice Sheth back to the Gujarat High Court.<sup>18</sup> However, though the outcome of this litigation was favourable to Justice Sheth, the Supreme Court refused to acknowledge that the consent of a high court judge was a necessary condition for his transfer to another high court, as a matter of principle. As a result, though the case vindicated Justice Sheth's stand, it did not question the legality of using transfers to punish independent judges.

Another unhappy practice developed—although vacancies were available for permanent judges, every high court judge was initially appointed as an additional judge before being confirmed as permanent. If the executive was unhappy with the decisions of a particular judge, he/she could be penalized by being refused confirmation as a permanent judge of that high court. This system clearly went against the principles of the Constitution, under which additional judges were to be appointed not as a matter of course, but only to meet temporary increase in business or work arrears.<sup>19</sup>

Before and during the Emergency, the government misused its powers to compromise the decisional independence of the courts. The powers of appointing and transferring judges were used to punish and coerce independent judges who were unwilling to toe the government's line on policy matters. A different dimension to judicial independence—rather the lack of it—became a reality. This move to undermine judicial independence altered the course of Indian constitutional development forever.

#### What Started It All: The Law Minister's Circular

On 18 March 1981, P. Shivshankar, law minister of the Congress government (which had returned to power after a short stint by the Janata Party) issued a circular to the governor of Punjab and all state chief ministers (except those of the north-eastern states). This circular requested them to: (1) Obtain the consent of additional judges of the relevant state high court to be appointed as permanent judges in any other high court in India, and (2) Obtain the consent of people who would be offered judgeship in the future to be appointed initially in a court other than their state high court (*see* Appendix on page 184). While the circular was supposedly issued to 'further national integration' and 'combat narrow parochial tendencies', it was actually an attempt to further emasculate judicial independence, by subjecting the higher judiciary to greater political control.<sup>20</sup>

The country reacted. Public interest litigations (PILs) were filed. The constitutional validity of the law minister's circular was challenged. Writ petitions were also filed, some questioning the practice of appointing additional judges despite vacancies for permanent judges, others challenging the constitutionality of transferring certain judges from one high court to another. The Supreme Court clubbed <sup>21</sup> eight such writ petitions (broadly falling within three categories) filed in courts across India to hear the matter and dispose of each of these petitions in the seminal case of *S.P. Gupta v. President of India* (*First Judges Case*) 22 in December 1981. The case takes its title from the writ petition filed by advocate S.P. Gupta of the Allahabad High Court, concerning the appointment of three additional judges of that court.

## Two Archaic Doctrines Eschewed: The Executive Has the Last Laugh

Each of the seven bench members issued a separate opinion in the *First Judges Case*, resulting in judgements that totalled nearly half a million words <sup>23</sup> and obscured, to some extent, the law on judicial appointments and transfers.<sup>24</sup> The government argued that since the writ petitions had been filed by senior advocates rather than the aggrieved parties (high court judges), the advocates had no locus standi<sup>25</sup> to move court. Until the late 1970s, the Supreme Court and high courts would entertain writ petitions only by people who were victims of an illegality or whose legal rights had been violated. However, in the *First Judges Case*, the PIL took firm root. Locus standi was extended forever!

The Supreme Court refused to adhere to its strict rules of 'standing', holding that the 'cause of

justice can never be allowed to be thwarted by any procedural technicalities'.<sup>26</sup> Each of the seven judges agreed on the right of the petitioners to bring the writ petitions. The Court laid down two liberal and salutary approaches to allow citizens to move the Supreme Court or high courts: (1) 'Representative standing', where a public-spirited citizen can file a writ petition to protect the poor, the downtrodden, and the economically or socially disadvantaged who are unable to effectively protect their rights, and (2) 'Citizen standing', where citizens can move court for the enforcement of public duties. <sup>27</sup> These principles formed the bedrock of public interest litigation in India and transformed the higher judiciary into an extremely important player in socioeconomic reforms and an integral part of decision-making—in an extended sense.

During the hearing, the petitioners requested the government to produce certain correspondence between the Union law minister, the CJI, and the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, which would have been vital to the court's conclusions. The government argued that such correspondence was protected by 'state privilege',<sup>28</sup> so the court could not ask for it. Rejecting this argument, the Supreme Court stated that transparency and openness are essential elements of a democratic society. It ordered that the correspondence be produced, asserting that the 'right to know' how a nation is governed is an essential pillar of democracy. This affirmation by the Supreme Court was arguably one of the starting points of the right to information movement in India. Therefore, in the course of its judgement in the *First Judges Case*, the Supreme Court moved away from two traditional rules of law—the rule of locus standi and the protection of privileged communication—and laid down seminal roadmaps.

Moving to the crux of the court's decision, the majority held that judges could not be transferred from one high court to another as punishment. At the same time, the Supreme Court reiterated what it had said in Justice Sheth's case—the consent of a high court judge was not a necessary precondition for his transfer. The court also held that although an additional judge should usually be made permanent after the expiry of his interim term, confirmation as a permanent judge was not a right in itself.

The most important issue on which the court ruled in the *First Judges Case* was the dynamics of power between the executive and the judiciary in appointing judges. The court held that the CJI's opinion in appointing judges of the high court and Supreme Court was *not* to receive primacy. The CJI did not possess a veto in making judicial appointments. In fact, the majority gave the executive the final say in making appointments to the higher judiciary.<sup>29</sup> Interestingly, the majority also refused to strike down the law minister's circular, stating that it had 'no constitutional or legal sanction'.<sup>30</sup>

#### *First Judges Case*: Good Journey, Bad Destination

The Supreme Court's decision in the *First Judges Case* was one of its many 'everybody wins' judgements of the 1970s and 1980s; it recognized an important doctrine (in favour of one party), but ultimately decided in favour of the opposing party.<sup>31</sup> It acknowledged that members of the bar had the right to file writ petitions in public interest, but yet it went ahead to make the government the final

arbiter on appointments to the higher judiciary, thus upsetting the earlier balance of power between the judiciary and the government.

Ironically, the most significant contribution of the *First Judges Case* was not in the realm of judicial appointments. By broadening the narrow rule of locus standi, the court opened the floodgates to social action litigation, and India has never been the same since. Such litigation has been used for an incredibly diverse range of issues including the protection of women from custodial violence,<sup>32</sup> protection of slum and pavement dwellers,<sup>33</sup> preservation of the environment,<sup>34</sup> provision of immediate medical aid to accident victims<sup>35</sup> and protection of women from sexual harassment at the workplace.<sup>36</sup> The *First Judges Case* redefined the role of constitutional courts in India:<sup>37</sup> the Supreme Court was transformed into the last bastion of hope for the poor<sup>38</sup> and is still seen the same way.

The court's ultimate verdict, however, ran contrary to constitutional convention.<sup>39</sup> It relegated the CJI to the position of an advisor and gave the substantial control over the judicial appointments process to the executive. Sadly, but knowingly, the Supreme Court compromised on its own independence. Although it 'developed the law in the right direction'<sup>40</sup> in many respects, the verdict was undesirable for India's democratic polity. From a position where the appointment power was balanced between the executive and the judiciary, the *First Judges Case* placed the executive in the driver's seat. Given that this occurred so soon after the Emergency, where the very same power of judicial appointments had been misused by the government to severely undermine judicial independence, one wonders why the court chose to compromise its independence by not retaining convention.

## *Second Judges Case*: Drifting between Extremes

Public opinion was far from benign. The form of judicial appointments conceptualized in the *First Judges Case* continued for almost a decade, but meanwhile, public opinion was being mobilized against the decision. Academics called for an impartial system of judicial appointments, to be administered by a collegial body consisting of members of the judiciary and the executive.<sup>41</sup> In the late 1980s, practising advocate Subhash Sharma, the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association and the Honorary Secretary of the Bombay Bar Association 42

filed petitions before the Supreme Court asking for the vacancies of the judges of the Supreme Court and various high courts to be filled. While hearing the petitions, the Supreme Court observed that its decision in the *First Judges Case* merited reconsideration by a larger bench of judges. 43

The questions on judicial appointments and transfers were therefore referred to a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in *Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India* 44 (*Second Judges Case*). Five separate opinions <sup>45</sup> were delivered by the bench and the majority overruled the earlier decision <sup>46</sup> of the Supreme Court in the *First Judges Case*.

The court emphasized that, under the Constitution, judicial appointments should be 'integrated, participatory and consultative'. In an ideal scenario, there should be no scope for 'primacy' of the
judiciary or the executive—both branches should make the appointments collectively, as originally contemplated by the Constitution. What the judgement effectively did was transfer the power of 'primacy' from the executive to the judiciary. So, when the government (via the President) and the CJI or chief justice of a high court conflicted over a particular judicial appointment, the Supreme Court in the *Second Judges Case* held that the latter's opinion would prevail.

And yet, while it secured primacy for the judiciary, the Supreme Court also sought to moderate its powers through the collegiate system. For appointments to the Supreme Court and high courts, the CJI was to decide after ascertaining the opinion of at least two of the most senior judges of the Supreme Court ('collegium' in the Supreme Court). For appointments of high court judges (where the chief justice of the relevant high court is also consulted), the chief justice of the high court was to decide after ascertaining the views of at least two of the most-senior judges of that high court (the 'collegium' in the relevant high court).

The *Second Judges Case* achieved the following in the area of judicial appointments: first, it overturned the decision in the *First Judges Case* and gave the last word on appointments to the judiciary; and second, it decentralized the power conferred upon the CJI/chief justice of the relevant high court by granting this power to a plurality of judges—the collegium.

On the issue of transfers of judges from one high court to another, the court held that the CJI's opinion would be decisive. However, on this issue as well, the court ensured decentralization of power by ruling that the CJI was to necessarily consult other judges whose opinion may be relevant before deciding to transfer a high court judge. Interestingly, though the court stuck to its position in the *First Judges Case* in finding that the consent of a high court judge was not a precondition for his transfer, it preserved its right to dictate!

### Criticism of the Verdict in the *Second Judges Case*: Sacred Ritual with New Priests

The rationale behind the Supreme Court's judgement in the *Second Judges Case* was to minimize political influence in judicial appointments and reduce the individual discretion of the chief justices of the Supreme Court and high courts by introducing the decentralized, collegium system.<sup>47</sup> In effect, the Supreme Court moved from one extreme (the government making judicial appointments) to the other (judges becoming the supreme authority in the judicial appointments process). Why? Perhaps it was an overcompensation—an exaggerated remedial measure to rectify the 'self-inflicted wound'<sup>48</sup> caused by the Supreme Court's judgement in the *First Judges Case*.

There is no doubt that the decision in the *Second Judges Case* virtually rewrote some provisions of the Constitution.<sup>49</sup> The expression 'consultation' (with the CJI, in relation to appointing judges) was tactfully changed to 'concurrence'. What since? There is criticism of the high degree of opacity in the functioning of the collegium system. It has been criticized by insiders (judges who have been members of the collegium) as well as outsiders.<sup>50</sup> Senior advocate Fali S. Nariman, lead counsel for the petitioner (Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association) in the *Second Judges Case*,

candidly said that this was a case he won, but one that he would 'prefer to have lost'.<sup>51</sup> In an interview, Justice J.S. Verma, author of the majority opinion in the *Second Judges Case*, lamented the manner in which the judgement was being implemented:

My 1993 judgement . . . was very much misunderstood and misused . . . Therefore, some kind of rethink is required. My judgement says the appointment process of high court and Supreme Court judges is basically a joint or participatory exercise between the executive and the judiciary, both taking part in it.<sup>52</sup>

## The judgement catalysed a shift in the balance of power, in favour of the judiciary. In the *First Judges Case,* Justice P.N. Bhagwati had this to say about the appointment power in question:

Today the process of judicial appointments and transfers is shrouded in mystery. The public does not know how judges are selected and appointed or transferred and whether any, and if so, what principles and norms govern this process. The exercise of the power of appointment and transfer remains a sacred ritual whose mystery is confined only to a handful of high priests . . . The mystique of this process is kept secret and confidential between just a few individuals, not more than two or four as the case may be, and the possibility cannot therefore be ruled out that howsoever highly placed may be these individuals, the process may on occasions result in the making of wrong appointments and transfers and may also at times, though fortunately very rare, lend itself to nepotism, political as well as personal and even trade-off.<sup>53</sup>

Unfortunately, later generations of Supreme Court judges have failed to heed Justice Bhagwati's lament. Despite judicial intervention in the *Second Judges Case*, the judicial appointment process remains as clandestine as it was in 1981. It remains, in every way, a mysterious sacred ritual—only the identity of the high priests has been altered.

## *Third Judges Case*: Presidential Reference

The next confrontation between the judiciary and the executive over the issue of judicial appointments took place in 1997–98. The CJI, Justice M.M. Punchhi, recommended the names of five people for appointment to the Supreme Court. The executive refused to do so, expressing doubts about whether the recommended people were fit to be appointed as Supreme Court judges. As a result, President K.R. Narayanan sought the Supreme Court's opinion under Article 143<sup>54</sup> on nine questions, covering three broad issues: (1) Consultation between the CJI and his brother judges for deciding on appointments to the high courts and the Supreme Court, (2) Judicial review of the transfer of judges, and (3) The relevance of seniority of high court judges in making appointments to the Supreme Court.

A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court delivered a unanimous opinion while answering the questions.<sup>55</sup> The court emphasized that judicial appointments would have to take place according to the principles enunciated in its decision in the *Second Judges Case*; the only revision it made was that for the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court, the collegium would consist of the CJI and four (as against two) senior-most colleagues. The judgement did not do much more than reiterate, endorse and perpetuate the collegium system of judicial appointments.

Lord Cooke of Thorndon, contributor to *Supreme But Not Infallible: Essays Written in Honour of the Supreme Court of India*, <sup>56</sup> used two quotes to summarize his views on the *Second Judges Case*

and the *Third Judges Case.* To emphasize how divergent the *Second Judges Case* was from the actual constitutional text and intent, he quoted Shakespeare:

*But man, proud man, Dressed in a little brief authority . . . Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven As make the angels weep*

—William Shakespeare's *Measure for Measure*, Act II, Scene 2

To emphasize how debatable the decision in the *Third Judges Case* was, he quoted from Alexander Pope's poem titled *An Essay on Criticism*: 'For fools rush in, where angels fear to tread.'

Lord Cooke's observations aptly sum up the Supreme Court's actions in the *Second Judges Case* and the *Third Judges Case*. Through a fantastic constitutional interpretation, the Supreme Court rushed into uncharted constitutional territory, arrogating to itself the unprecedented power of carrying out judicial appointments. The decisions, though well-intentioned, have upset the balance of power as envisaged by our Constitution.

### Who Will Watch the Watchers?

India has one of the most detailed constitutions in the world. It includes a chunk of administrative details to ensure that the constitutional process cannot be subverted. In spite of this, the judiciary has had to step in on many occasions to add to these details to ensure that the play in the joints provided by the makers of the Constitution was not misused. The appointments process is a paradigm example. In the spirit of the Constitution, the scheme of judicial appointments was meant to establish a system of checks and balances, where merit was the foremost consideration. If the executive had discussed, freely and frankly, with the CJI in all cases, without political compulsions or misaligned agendas, perhaps we would not have been struggling to find some sense of balance in the appointments procedure today. 57

Within two decades, we have moved from one extreme to the other: from a judiciary controlled by the will of the executive to a judiciary with theoretically unbridled and unchecked power. Today, there is no institutionalized system of making recommendations for the appointment of judges. <sup>58</sup> The lack of transparency in the process has impacted the Supreme Court's legitimacy—a legitimacy it must desperately preserve, given the super-administrative role it has undertaken in the Indian democratic set-up. <sup>59</sup> Many who were closely associated with the *Second Judges Case* later expressed deep anguish at the effect of the judgement. Some say there is a real threat to the Indian judiciary from within.<sup>60</sup> Though most people would choose judge-controlled appointments as against politically controlled ones, it is time to attain a balance of power in selecting members of arguably the most powerful institution in India.

In constitutional theory, it is unprecedented to vest judicial appointment power in the Supreme Court. 61 In his book *The Least Dangerous Branch*, noted American jurist and law professor

Alexander Bickel coined a term that now defines the nature of the judicial office. Bickel argued that the judicial role, by its very nature, was 'counter-majoritarian' and anti-democratic. He questioned the power of unelected, nominated judges to strike down laws passed by elected representatives of the people. While elected representatives are answerable to the people in periodic elections, judicial officers are nominated (not elected) and, once nominated, continue to rise through the hierarchy without being directly accountable to the people in any way. Yet, constitutions around the world empower an unelected judicial branch to review and invalidate actions of the elected branches of government.

Numerous constitutional law jurists have tried to resolve and answer the 'counter-majoritarian difficulty', but, over time, the judiciary's counter-majoritarian nature has been accepted as an unavoidable feature, which may be minimized if not completely resolved. In India's context, the Supreme Court exercises extensive powers in reviewing government actions and striking down (when necessary) laws and even constitutional amendments made by the Parliament. Yet, while judges in most other countries are appointed by independent commissions or by popularly elected governments, the Supreme Court's self-appointment power, coupled with its extensive powers, makes its countermajoritarian character particularly pronounced.

As a way out, legal scholars have suggested creating a National Judicial Commission (composed of public functionaries from the judiciary and the executive), which would have the power to appoint judges of the higher judiciary. <sup>62</sup> The United Kingdom has introduced a similar process of judicial appointments following the Constitution Reform Act, 2005, whereby judicial appointments are made by an independent Judicial Appointments Commission comprising political, judicial and professional members. Similarly, the Consultative Council of European Judges in opinion titled 'Independence of the Judiciary and the Irremovability of Judges<sup>'63</sup> recommended that judicial appointments should be made by an independent authority on the basis of predetermined and publicized objective criteria to ensure transparency in the appointment process.

Proposals for a National Judicial Commission have been introduced in the Parliament on three separate occasions, but none has materialized. At this juncture, a commission of this nature seems to be the only solution to restore the system of checks and balances in judicial appointments and infuse transparency and accountability into the process.

Circular issued by the Union law minister to the governor of Punjab and the chief ministers of all states (except the north-eastern states)<sup>64</sup>

D.O. No. 66/10/81-Jus. Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs, India New Delhi – 110 001 March 18, 1981

#### My dear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,

It has repeatedly been suggested to Government over the years by several bodies and forums including the States Reorganisation Commission, the Law Commission and various Bar Associations that to further national integration and to combat narrow parochial tendencies bred by caste, kinship and other local links and affiliations, one-third of the Judges of the High Court should as far as possible be from outside the State in which that High Court is situated. Somehow, no start could be made in the past in this direction. The feeling is strong, growing and justified that some effective steps should be taken very early in this direction.

2. In this context, I would request you to:

a) Obtain from all the Additional Judges working in the High Court of your State their consent to be appointed as permanent Judges in any other High Court in the country. They could, in addition, be requested to name three High Courts, in order of preference, to which they would prefer to be appointed aspermanent Judges; and

b) Obtain from persons who have already been or may in the future be proposed by you for initial appointment their consent to be appointed to any other High Court in the country along with a similar preference for three High Courts.

3. While obtaining the consent and the preference of the persons mentioned in paragraph 2 above, it may be made clear to them that the furnishing of the consent or the indication of a preference does not imply any commitment on the part at the Government either in regard to their appointment or in regard to accommodation in accordance with the preferences given.

4. I would be grateful if action is initiated very early by you and the written consent and preferences of all Additional Judges as well as of persons recommended by you for initial appointment are sent to me within a fortnight of the receipt of this letter.

5. I am also sending a copy of this letter to the Chief Justice of your High Court.

With regards, Yours sincerely, (P. Shivshankar)  $Sd$ <sup> $\sim$ </sup>
